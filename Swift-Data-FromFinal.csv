Hi!

I am creating a Swift app and am having trouble using Cocoa pods and decided it would probably be optimal to get my feet wet in case I find a library or framework I *really* want.

I keep finding a specific error even after I seem to have fixed it:

    [!] The `$MyAppTests [Release]` target overrides the `ALWAYS_EMBED_SWIFT_STANDARD_LIBRARIES` build setting defined in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-$myapp/Pods-$myapp.release.xcconfig'. This can lead to problems with the CocoaPods installation
    - Use the `$(inherited)` flag, or
    - Remove the build settings from the target.

Even though, searching for it, [I have already given it the `$(inherited)` flag](http://imgur.com/a/N1X2C). I have also restarted Xcode, used Cocoa Pod's XCWorkspace, pulled a fresh copy from Git to re-do it (like, 3 times.) but this error never resolves.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Solution: I am a retard. If you are reading this *in the future* and seem to be experiencing the same issue, best I can say is make sure both the app itself and the tests have the `$(inherited)` flag. I'm going to my shame corner now.

PS: If you get a ""Cannot load underlying dependency"" error, just ⌘+B and it will *probably* go away.",Cocoa Pods makes me want to scream

I'm trying to integrate peek and pop on my buttons.

    func previewingContext(_ previewingContext: UIViewControllerPreviewing, viewControllerForLocation location: CGPoint) -&gt; UIViewController?

    func indexPathForItem(at point: CGPoint) -&gt; IndexPath?

and then, can retrieve the element targeted by the user.

But I use a classic StackView, so I tried to use CGPoint given by the delegate to guess the targeted button in the stack view, but the 'frame' property of the button return its location relative to the stack view and not the main frame.

Why I'm using stack view ? Because I change the stack view axis when the user rotate the device, so buttons are next to each others.

If you open a .storyboard file you can see all the elements and their properties with enough information to build a whole app from scratch. As I've read from online articles there is also the possibility to inject code into apps making it fully functional from components downloaded on demand from the web.

So all we need is an app browser which gets an app link and downloads all the components from the URI to build a fully functioning app.

How feasible is that? What purpose would it have? Is the next web about online apps on demand? What about URIs like app://example.com/weather?

Interested in trying kotlin for a small web service I was building, I started working on a web framework:

## kog: https://github.com/danneu/kog

Inspired by clojure, I wrapped jetty with a simple `Request -&gt; Response` abstraction and have been stubbing out machinery on top of it ever since, informed by the web service I've been building alongside it.

Two months later it has a decent feature surface area from json encode/decode combinators to a type-safe router to accept-header negotiation, though riddled with `// TODO:`'s and stopping points that came too soon.

60,1562,2017-01-30 19:28:39,8,2,"I'm currently playing around with Swift and just realized that when subclassing another class and overriding a method, I don't have to call the same method on super like you would expect. I could have sworn that other languages forced the call to super, but maybe I'm remembering incorrectly? The only methods that seem to force the call to super, at least in Swift, are initializers.

Why is not calling to super allowed when overriding inherited methods? Isn't there a huge danger here in missing out on required parent class implementation details of the method? I assumed that the compiler would immediately complain and force me to call super.

This might be a little academic but I was debating with someone online regarding the use of Generics with the type Any. 

My position is that using Any inside Generic functions or, more fundamentally, returning Any from generic functions is basically really bad practice and defeats the point of using generics in the first place. 

The type information is lost when you use Any, forcing casting, which is the very thing Generics tries to preserve. 

Here is an example I wrote, it shows how the generic function without Any preserves the type information.

Right now I have created the method to send async via callbacks, but I would like the ability to send synchronously, and handle the threading at a higher level.
Currently my communication method looks something like this:

        ???

Is there a general way to wrap a async all like that above?

In case I am thinking of this totally wrong, what Id' like in some cases to simply be able to call

    send(""foo"", closure: { result in

The solution was to keep a pointer to the delegate in my view controller like this:

            self.textFieldDelegate = RangedNumberFieldDelegate(field: self.textField, lower: 0, upper: 100)

Today I said ""I want to hook up a slider to a label so that the value of the slider is reflected in the number of the label"".

I tried and didn't have success on my own, as simple a task as that is. So I go online and find some tutorials. I found [this one.](https://www.ioscreator.com/tutorials/uislider-tutorial-ios8-swift) It's for ios8 but I'm hoping swift didn't change so much from version 2 - version 3 that this code wouldn't still work.

The code in this tutorial however did NOT work. I did eventually get it working. Here is the code I used:
    
        @IBOutlet weak var numberLabel: UILabel!
        @IBOutlet weak var slider: UISlider!
        @IBAction func sliderChangedValue(_ sender: UISlider) {
            let currentValue = Int(sender.value)
            numberLabel.text = ""\(currentValue)""
        }

My question is twofold.

One, why did I have to change ""var currentValue"" to ""let currentValue""? It seems to me since my value is changing it should be a var? Or maybe this doen't count as a changing value because they value will always be ""sender.value"" and never ""sender2.value""?

Which brings me to my second question...why was var currentValue used in that tutorial? Is it just that swift has changed since that tutorial was written?

Please advise.

I am really wanting to get into mobile dev especially for iOS. Close to a year ago I started developing an app and to be honest, I was learning as I went and didn't feel like I learned very much... it was kind of just jiggling around with stuff until it did what I wanted (very bad practice, i know). Well, recently I opened up XCode and with the new switch over to swift 3, it left some bugs in my code. At this point, I realized I couldn't debug my code because I didn't have the in depth knowledge about all my code. 

With all this said, I've decided to need to go back and relearn swift, being more thorough this time around. I am proficient in other programming languages and understand code in general, it's mostly syntax and other things specific to mobile dev that I really need/want to learn. Does anyone have any good sources or material for me to learn swift specific code and most importantly, the way the scenes work.

155,757,2017-03-18 19:41:12,10,3,"Hi,
I am learning swift and really trying to dig into MVC and making sure my model is set up correctly. I am creating a data structure that will have hundreds of related nested statistics, each of those statistics will have a couple of values attached to them and so far I found a tuple to be a good fit for modelling the data.

    struct Stats {
    //My actual data has very close relationships with each other so they belong in a single struct, this is just an example to demonstrate the issue.

    //The stats will be filled in the initialiser and all stats will have the same associated values, 2 doubles named asStat, count and potentially a string. All stats will eventually be used in collections with custom cells (adding a string value to each stat would make it easy for each custom cell to generate its own label). 

    var alphaProject = (
        earlyPhase: (
            animals: (count: 0.0, asStat: 0.0),
            roads: (count: 0.0, asStat: 0.0),
            wheels: (count: 0.0, asStat: 0.0)
        ),
        midPhase: (
            crashes: (count: 0.0, asStat: 0.0),
            runs: (count: 0,0, asStat: 0.0)
        ),
        latePhase: (
            names: (count: 0.0, asStat: 0.0),
            crushed: (count: 0.0, asStat: 0.0)
        )
    )
    
    var winners = (
        fromDraw: (
            firstWinners: (count: 0.0, asStat: 0.0),
            secondWinners: (count: 0.0, asStat: 0.0)
        ),
        fromCompeting: (
            scores: (count: 0.0, asStat: 0.0),
            tinCansCollected: (count: 0.0, asStat: 0.0)
        )
    )
}

&amp;nbsp;

 This provides me concise and safe accessibility when I need to access data from an instance of the struct within the view controller.

    class ViewController: NSViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        let stats = Stats()
        let earlyPhase = stats.alphaProject.earlyPhase
        
        print(earlyPhase.roads.count) //Great! dot notation to access potentionally hundreds of stats. Lots of safety by not needing to use strings
        
        //But.....
        
        //I now have no way (at least that I know of) of looping over earlyphase and this will error out
        for stat in earlyPhase {
            //Create a label, perform operations, do something with stat.AsStat , stat.count
        }
    }
}

In my model I know I have the option to create each stat as a double and prefix each with something similar:

    var alphaProject_earlyPhase_stat  = 0.0 
    var alphaProject_earlyPhase_count = 0.0

As more stats are added, nesting gets deeper and stat names may get larger it feels like that will get very messy, very fast and be really hard to maintain. It's probably worth me noting that this is a personal project but for my own best practices I am approaching it as if other people would have to work on it.

&amp;nbsp;


To create the collections and views I want I need to be able to pass around and iterate over parts of the stats data, I am not sure how to re-model the data to maintain the safety I currently have but gain the functionality that I need. Any input on this would be greatly appreciated and hopefully put me on the right path of data modelling.

Cheers.

I'm creating a value called ""currentlyPlaying"" that returns the value of a Realm Object ""Show"" based on the time. Here is where I create it:

    var currentlyPlaying: Show {
        let date = Date()
        let calendar = Calendar.current
        let minutes = calendar.component(.minute, from: date)
        print(minutes)
        if (minutes == 22) {
            return shows[0]
        } else {
            return shows[1]
        }
    }

It's a WIP while I test it but the idea is you get the current time and depending on that, you return a specific Show.

I was hoping that RxSwift (with RxRealm) would allow me to just observe the property ""currentlyPlaying"" and when that changes due to the minute changing, it would automatically update the UI to mirror the change. Here is the code for setting up RxRealm:

    func setupRx() {
        let realm = try! Realm()
        Observable.from(realm.object(ofType: Station.self, forPrimaryKey: id)!)
        .map { (station) -&gt; String in

        .bindTo(title.rx.text)
        .addDisposableTo(disposeBag)
    }

The reason I decided to implement adding multiple nodes programmatically instead of creating a variable for each new node is because I want to create arrays of nodes such as ""Hot/Room Temp/Cold"" that will be children to parents like ""Cools/Bud/Coke"" by programatically building and appending them I do not need to keep adding a new variable for each individual node, just generate a bunch of nodes and attach them to a parent as children.   

The problem becomes accessing the nodes. The tree itself will remain static, no nodes will be added or removed during runtime only the properties of the nodes will be changed. After doing some reading NSOutlineView (mac) is capable of iterating through a tree and displaying everything in a drop down menu which will work for my needs but if I wanted to create custom views that only displayed certain parts of the tree, would I have to create variables for each node to be able to iterate correctly over them? In the guide I linked there is a search function implementation but that searches string values of which I will have plenty of duplicates as ""Hot/Room Temp/Cold will be created and appended to as many drinks as I decide to implement.

My question is what's the standard way people view sections of trees and/or iterate over the entirety of a tree when only the root node is accessible by a named variable.

I use Firebase and SwiftKeyChainWrapper for my authentication.

Looking for tutorials or references I can look at for my certain issue.

1)How would I go about switching the sender email address? Would I have to use  email verification?    
2)Is there an easy tutorial about using some sort of check box system to show more information about the job?

I am a total beginner, my only real experience is a few months of learning python for a very slow-paced and mediocre intro to programming course in a college I'm currently enrolled in.

The class is subpar and I've taught myself mostly through treehouse (which is okay), codecademy and python tutorials on youtube. I've got no real interest in going the data science route, so I don't feel python will be my endgame. I will most likely not continue it after this semester - actually, after this semester I will most likely be dropping out altogether to instead try to teach myself a programming language and get a job. I am early in school (still have multiple years to go), and creeping up on the later part of my 20s, and don't have much time or money to spare. I've mostly worked non-tech jobs with the exception of a position at a startup that didn't last. 

Not sure how to proceed, but I do have an interest in iOS apps and am curious about heading in that direction. Should I be apprehensive about being a noob and learning swift and trying to get a job as an iOS dev, seeing as though objective C is still the norm for so many companies?

I'm truly quite lost with how to proceed and any advice would be hugely appreciated. One option I am currently heavily considering is Udacity's nanodegree plus for iOS dev, $299/mo and they guarantee a job within 6 months after completion. I know many will say brick and mortar college option is the best route forward, but it will take time and money that I can't really spare at this stage in my life. I'm also willing to do a bootcamp.

http://www.swiftprogrammer.info/swift_call_cpp.html

But the brotli project is not the one i would like to include – **mine only has one .cpp file with 40 lines of code**  😁

**Could any of you who have experience with including c++ and c files** (and how to write a bridge to use the functions in Swift) **help me to add a small c++ function to a Swift project**?

Here is the .cpp file:
https://github.com/phvu/cuda-smi/blob/master/cuda-smi.cpp

The `main()` function simply prints a line containing info about your free VRAM to the Terminal. I would like to use this string in an App that displays the memory info to a percentage bar (that gets updated every second).

I'm not sure if i can (and how to) create a wrapper because to generate the binary from the repo you need Nvidias `nvcc` compiler.

I hope you can give me some starting help! I'm very grateful for any kind of help – because when i understand how to include c++ code for such an easy example maybe i can move forward to more complex ones.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Dirty Solution:** I could just spawn a background bash process from Swift (with `NSTask()`), then process the string of the tasks output (with `NSPipe()`). But that seems like a clumsy solution – i would rather not try to create a background process when i can run it in the main task.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

PS: If i can't write a c++ wrapper for this because of problems with the `nvvc` compiler – do you know a Swift framework/library that provides a similar function?

**I basically just need to know two things:** 

1. The maximum available GPU memory
1. The current used memory

    var person = Person()
    let person.name = ""Taylor Swift""
    let person.age = 27
    let person.greet = { text in print(""Hello \(text)"") }
    person.greet(""Megan"") // Hello Megan

Or we could simply parse a Json text into an object without jumps and hoops like:

    let person = JSONwhatever(@JSON{""name"":""Taylor Swift"", ""age"": 27})
    print(""\(person.name) is \(person.age) years old"")

Due to the ephemerality of the object, everything should be treated as nil if not found.

Also, it would be good to add string reflection for properties and methods so we can call:

    let myProp = ""name""
    print(person[myProp])

    let myAction = ""greet""
    print(person[myAction](""Megan"")) // Hello Megan

QUESTIONS ( i know these probably sound noobish )

-  why do we have to subclass from UIViewController instead of just creating an instance of it to modify for our purposes ? 

- the first thing we see when we open a new xcode project is a ""view controller"" , this confuses me because in the MVC design i was told that the model / view / and controller are separate , yet in the area where i'm managing views or the visual aspect of my app , there is this ""controller"" that i can see. i think i understand that the code for the associated controller is where we dictate the actual controller , but why is a ""view"" available in the library then ? why does our default interface include a visual representation of a controller ? is there an associated ""view"" created with every view controller we drag to the storyboard ? this concept really confuses me please help.

- with a view controller we have to manually link it to our code when creating one in the storyboard file , but there are other controllers that don't have a file directly associated with it ,is that because any UI object we add from the library becomes a child of the view or controller itself ? i know each UIElement has it's own documentation , but the stuff i've seen allows for us to drag these elements onto a view or view controller and access their properties and methods though the code of the associated controller by ctrl click dragging into the class definition.

i feel like i'm all over the place , but at the same time i feel like i'm about to make a breakthrough in understanding this stuff if i could just understand xcode's relationship with the MVC model.

I have a ui that I would like to update at the top of each minute. Is there a way to set a Timer so that it begins firing each time the minute changes. My current solution starts the timer whenever the UI loads, however, that means unless the user has to load the ui at the top of the minute, or it will be off by several seconds.

As a side note, I have several ui pieces on a viewcontroller that need to be updated. I was thinking of having the Timer fire off a Notification that is observed by each of these pieces. Is that the best way to do accomplish this? I've heard Notifications are somewhat inefficient. Alternatively I was thinking of having each ui piece have a ""minuteDidChange"" function that is called by the superview on minute change.

Is there a name for this way of writing extensions?
I personally think this way of writing extensions is great because it creates a nice level of separation between the class being extended and the library extending it. What is the original implementation and what belongs to the framework is easily understood, also it avoids naming collisions entirely so I liked it enough to introduce it into my own library here:

    ]
    
    func doSomething(_ c: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;Int&gt;) {

This works fine - we're able to pass the first index of `c` as `UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;Int&gt;`.  Now replace the last line with this:

    for i in 0..&lt;c.count {
        doSomething(&amp;c[i])
    }

This produces the following error: `cannot convert value of type '[Int]' to expected argument type 'Int'`

It appears that Swift needs to know the index of `c` that will be passed at *compile time*, which is either a bug or a severe limitation. Any ideas?

**Edit:** we can simplify this even further while still getting the same error, so saying Swift doesn't ""know"" the index probably isn't accurate:

Hello, I am trying to learn PureLayout, but I cannot make sense of their example files. I have tried doing simple colored squares using their pod but my simulator screen is just white. I tried copying and pasting their code into a fresh project and still just white. 

What I want to do, is simply create a TestView.swift file and in it create a UIView called blueView. I want to pint it 25 from top, left, right, and bottom and fill it blue. 

I can do this, if I do all the view code inside the view controller and either write it inside ViewDidLoad or write a method and then call that method inside VDL. 

However. What I am confused about is that the sample files they provide do not even have VDL in the VC. They use loadView() and updateViewConstraints() (which I have never seen before). When I try to do it their way I get a white screen.
I am frustrated on what I am doing wrong.

So my question is. Can somebody either explain step by step how, using PureLayout, to create a View and ViewController file and link them up using those 2 methods (which PureLayout uses) or paste simple code / repository showing how to do this in Swift.

The position of each tile is fixed to the grid location the user dropped it, so no flow layout with a UICollection. However the user can move the tiles to a new location with a long press.

Im pretty new to swift but I have watched a good few tutorials (about 100 hours worth), read plenty of posts/blogs/etc feel I have the basics down (at least, I understand them) but am finding it hard to ""connect the dots"" when it comes to actually creating working apps.

Today I found a video tutorial to build a basic game, and it was great! I was wondering if there were any other (preferably free) resources for a tutorial where we build a specific app from start to finish? I am sure there is I just cannot find it.

I already checked the swift tutorials sub but there seems to be nothing there (also seems pretty dead?)

example : when i create a class in swift , i must create an instance to make something unique from it. but immediately that idea is challenged when working with xcode because it looks like when working with a view controller i'm working directly on a class declaration and not an instance. i feel like i am to understand that just because i've typed that name into xcode as the associated class that they are linked somehow , but nowhere in swift 3 coding classes did i see any examples where we write code to modify something unique directly inside of a class that way so it really throws me off. is there any good reading , or internet tutorials someone can link me to to help me bridge the gap between these two ?

I added some break points and started walking through the code and noticed that when my controller called a method in my persistence layer it was instead landing in a completely different method, which threw invalid argument exceptions causing the app to crash.

I double, triple and quadruple checked, and made sure it still ran fine in the simulator.

I ""fixed"" it by cutting the func I wanted to call and pasting that above the func that was being incorrectly called - i.e. I just switched places with the two functions. Then when I ran the app again on my iPhone, everything worked as expected. 

Then I switched the functions back to the order they originally appeared in and ran it again. It worked fine.

I'm getting warnings for example on the line:

        private var shareButton: UIBarButtonItem!

I don't see a good way of making that line non-force-unwrapped, because it uses self to set its target. Any ideas here? I'm thinking about simply disabling the swiftlit rule implicitly_unwrapped_optional but that doesn't feel very satisfying either.

Final code looks roughly like this:

294,643,2017-06-14 08:48:33,5,0,"I'm working with [Vapor's Fluent](https://github.com/vapor/fluent) and I'm trying to make a user authorization package inspired by [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/authorization).

So I have a `Gate` class which checks if a user is allowed to perform a certain action on a certain entity. And I define two kinds of entities, the ""normal"" entities which are already defined by Fluent and ""ownable"" entities.

    public protocol Ownable: Entity {
        associatedtype User: Entity
        func has(owner: User) -&gt; Bool
    }

So in my Gate class I define two different methods for these two types of entities:

    public class Gate&lt;User: Entity, Action: NodeConvertible&gt; {
        public init() {}
        
        public func check(_ user: User?, can action: Action, _ entity: Entity) -&gt; Bool {
            print(""checking normal entity"")
            return true
        }
        
        public func check&lt;Object: Ownable&gt;(_ user: User?, can action: Action, _ entity: Object) -&gt; Bool where Object.Owner == User {
            print(""checking ownable entity"")
            return true
        }
    }

So I would expect that if I define a post like a normal entity:

    class Post: Entity {
        let storage = Storage()
        var title: String
        
        init(title: String) {
            self.title = title
        }
        
        required convenience init(row: Row) throws {
            try self.init(title: row.get(""title""))
        }
        
        func makeRow() -&gt; Row {
            return Row([""title"": .string(title)])
        }
    }

And call `gate.check(user, can: .update, post)` it would print `""checking normal entity""`. Which is does, so all is well so far.

But if I would make `Post` conform to `Ownable`, like so:

    extension Post: Ownable {
        func has(owner: User) -&gt; Bool {
            return true
        }
    }

I would expect if I'd call `gate.check(user, can: .update, post)` that it would print `""checking ownable entity""`. Which is doesn't. It still prints `""checking normal entity""`. I know that it's technically correct to call either method, but I thought / hoped that Swift would choose the most specific one whenever it can.

I can make it work by giving the two methods slightly different names or argument signatures, but the whole point was that the developer using this authorization package wouldn't have to worry about that.

Is this a bug in the swift compiler? Or is this by design? Is there any way I can help the compiler choose the right method without giving both methods a different interface? Unfortunately I can't write `if entity is Ownable { /* use other method */ }`, because `Ownable` has an associated type.",I think I found a bug in the swift compiler. Or am I doing something wrong?

Considering that Apple's chips probably have a lower tdp than even Intel's Core M chips, I'd say that a MacBook with the A11 chip might actually be a cool idea.

But those chips use the ARM instruction set instead of x86. Now I don't understand much about it, but to me it sounds like the only thing one needs to do to switch between those, is to have a compiler which compiles your code to a different instruction set. Since (especially) swift code is so high level, the code itself wouldn't need to change at all. At least, that's my guess, am I correct?

Also I've never actually submitted an app to the app store. So I don't know, is Apple in possession of the source code? Since they need to review the app? Or do they only get the compiled app? Because if they're in possession of the source code then they could recompile every app in the app store for the ARM instruction set, right? And if not, well then that's definitely an obstacle.

303,302,2017-06-19 22:08:42,1,1,"If you're developing with iOS, you're probably used to constantly casting untyped values you're getting from Apple's frameworks. It's gotten better over the years, but a lot of libraries still need to be updated to give swiftier interfaces.

Of course if you have forced casting code like the following, you're going to look like you're new to Swift and if you're using a linter it's not going to be happy.

`let devices = AVCaptureDevice.devices(withMediaType: AVMediaTypeVideo) as! [AVCaptureDevice]`

The right way to do this, if you're [failing fast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast), is to guard the cast with a fatal error.

    guard let devices = AVCaptureDevice.devices(withMediaType: AVMediaTypeVideo) else {
        fatalError(""Missing video devices"")
    }
    
If you have a lot of critical casts that must go through, the boilerplate quickly adds up. You might be tempted to go with a forced cast, but I'm here to give another option.

    let devices: [AVCaptureDevice] = Critical.cast(AVCaptureDevice.devices(withMediaType: AVMediaTypeVideo),
                                                   errorMessage: ""Missing video devices"")

Using this method you're explicitly stating that you know what you're doing, giving an error message to help debug catastrophic failure, and reducing a conditional statement.

Here's the code behind Critical.cast:

    class Critical {
        
        static func cast&lt;CastType&gt;(_ valueMaybe: Any?,
                                   errorMessage errorMessageMaybe: String? = nil,
                                   file: StaticString = #file,

                if let errorMessage = errorMessageMaybe {
                    message = errorMessage + "" : ""

                }
                message += ""Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping a critical cast "" +
                    ""in \(method) to \(CastType.self)""

1. Since every bubble in my app is UIView - it is has a rectangle shape and even though it renders bubbles, collision works on rectangle canvas.

2. When I'm trying to drag bubbles around - gravity and collision does not work anymore

3. How can I make gravity/collision behavior persist after I had interaction with object (and even while I'm still dragging the object)



This makes me think that spawning UIView objects and applying physics to them is not the brightest idea, and I probably should spawn some other objects, but I need a guidance here. 

What objects should i really create? How I can make them ""round"" ? How I can interact with them (i.e. select, create, destroy, redraw etc. in case in later iteration of my app I will decide to add functionality like changing object size, creating or destroying objects on UI action)

311,295,2017-06-22 19:12:37,7,1,"Hi /r/swift

Question about converting between TimeZones. I have a set of Strings that correspond to Dates (ex. `""Thu 22:00""`) that I want to convert from GMT to the user's local TimeZone. This issue I'm facing is that there doesn't seem to be a way to ""assign"" a TimeZone to these dates.

    var components = DateComponents()
    components.weekday = 5
    components.hour = 18
    components.minute = 30
    var calendar = Calendar.current
    calendar.timeZone = TimeZone(abbreviation: ""GMT"")!
    let date = calendar.date(from: components)

    let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
    dateFormatter.timeZone = TimeZone(abbreviation: ""EDT"")
    dateFormatter.dateFormat = ""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss""
    let convertedDate = dateFormatter.date(from: String(date))!

Here I would expect that `date` is the same time that has been assigned according to the components (`Thu 6:30 PM`) in GMT time. Instead it actually converts `Thu 6:30 PM` to GMT time. This causes the converted time to be off since it is converting to GMT in the in the initial DateFormatter.

What I'm wondering is, is there a way to assign the `Date` to be a certain TimeZone, so that when I format a string like `Thu 6:30 PM` it will be of that same value except GMT.",Converting Dates to different TimeZones

Some further reading revealed that before submitting an app to the Appstore you need to remove the parts from your Universal Framework that are needed for it to work with the Simulator. 

This seems like an inconvenient process in my eyes. If I want to distribute my Framework, I will have to tell everyone ""Listen, before you submit your app, you need to do this additional step of stripping the Simulator parts.""

1) Set the Prototype Cell to Custom

2) Drag and Drop a Horizontal Stack View, and use the Add New Constraints tool to constraint the stack view to the margins of the cell. 

3) Add a label to the cell, and add a vertical stack view. Set the vertical stack view's ""Distribution"" property to ""Fill Equally"" so that the two labels share equal space. 

4) Change the label's Horizontal Content Hugging Priority from 251 to 252.

5) Create a new Cocoa Touch Class with a subclass UITableViewCell (which I called BookTableViewCell.swift), and update the custom class of the prototype cell to match the name of the new Cocoa Touch Class.

6) As per the instructions, here's my BookTableViewCell.swift file:

    import UIKit

    class BookTableViewCell: UITableViewCell {

However, recently watching Planet of the Apps has made me miss it a lot, and I have an app I've been wanting to build for awhile now. My only issue is that I can't find a system already made for what I need that I can purchase. I don't have enough skill currently to build this either. I have a few months to dedicate to this and I plan on restarting and finishing with Udacity to get my Nanodegree. I need to do this to earn a living and to start a business, so if this is already built and I can just buy it, that would be much better. I need a multi-shop checkout. Exactly like the app Dote has. I've been wanting to develop my app for about 9 months now and have built a rough outline of what it looks like and given it some functionality, but this is the biggest thing I need.

Hi /r/swift.

I have recently suggested learning Swift to two friends, both are not iOS devs and both don't have Macs. They looked into the language and also checked out this sub. Both came back to ask me why there is so much iOS specific content and even general programming questions on here.

I too get thrown off by the questions and posts on here. I'd love /r/swift to be a place to find the newest most interesting Swift related blog posts, discussions and questions. But the reality is that browsing /r/swift means filtering through a mess of repetitions of the same questions about Swift, about iOS/macOS development and even about app/game development in general to find the interesting content.

Thus, I think it would be beneficial both for the quality of content on this sub and also for the exposure and growth of Swift on Linux and other non-Apple platforms (gotta get to [Swift world domination](https://oleb.net/blog/2017/06/chris-lattner-wwdc-swift-panel/#in-which-fields-would-you-like-to-see-swift-in-the-future)) to implement some rule changes. I'd suggest something like the following:

- If you're posting links to iOS libraries, questions about iOS/macOS frameworks, development for Apple platforms in general (Xcode, signing, iTunes Connect, ...) etc., you should probably post in /r/iOSProgramming or ask on StackOverflow instead, but exceptions may apply.  

   Similar to /r/ruby:

  &gt; Rails-specific posts are encouraged to be posted in the r/rails subreddit.
- No questions answered in the FAQ. This could go together with expanding the FAQ a bit.
- No ""homework style"" questions. I think it would make sense for these to go into a separate subreddit. /r/learnswift is already a sub, maybe that would be a good choice.

  Inspired by /r/python:
  
  &gt; If you are about to ask a question, please consider r/learnpython or the learn python discord. Homework-style questions will be removed, and you'll be encouraged to post there instead.

A small group of people go through the phases of app design at the same time, with a reddit post at the beginning of each phase.  Each participant is encouraged to post an update, even if there's nothing new.

# Interest
When I posted the original idea, there were 39 people that reached out!  Most people, I'd assume, won't follow through -- but that still leaves quite a bit that will!
The initial post was here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/6jf27s/teamwork_who_wants_to_build_an_app_together_kind/

# PPAP
Isn't that a ridiculous YouTube video?  Yes, but it also happens to be an acronym for ""Peer-Pressured App Phases"" -- it sums up the idea quite nicely!  Coding an app in a structured period, alongside other remote individuals that are working on the same portion of their app at the same time, encouraged to post updates (some semblance of accountability).

# Delay
Why'd it take three weeks for me to follow-up with this next post?  I wound up talking to someone that gave some critical (brutal) feedback, and turned this into something that had more structure.  Part of the feedback was going into this with more details on the phases, and how progress reports would work.  There's a list of phases below, please help provide some input!

# Accountability
Each post that kicks off a new phase should include username mentions, as a subtle reminder that those coders that ""signed up"" for this should remain part of it!

# Mentors
There were a bunch of people that also sent me messages offering help to those people that volunteer for this.  These ""mentors"" can play a fantastic, and unplanned, role in this exercise!  If someone volunteers to be a mentor, they should probably get mentioned in the phase posts, also.

# Phases
**These are not set in stone!**  Please feel free to comment and provide updates.  I'm going to list the title of the brainstormed phase, along with an estimate of how many days we should remain in that phase.  I need input on this; lots of input!

- Create goal off app; value proposition to user (2)
- Sketch main screens (2)
- Plan database (2)
- Implement CoreData structure (4)
- Create models (4)
- Generate views (4)
- Produce controllers (3)
- Build settings panels (2)
- Pre-load app data (3)
- Add in-app purchases (2)
- Optional Game Center integration (3)
- iCloud integration (3)
- Include Analytics (2)
- In-app ""rate my app"" prompt (2)
- Build App Icons (4)
- Generate screenshots/video for App Store (3)
- Create a web ""landing page"" for the app (2)
- TestFlight our apps (4)
- Upload to App Store!

# Follow-ups
Unless the moderators here don't like the idea, I'll try to create a reddit post at the beginning of each phase, with the blocked [PPAP-#] at the beginning, denoting the current phase that we're starting.  If everyone agrees, I'll try to add a list of users participating, and mentors, inside the post.

# Who am I?
By the way, I'm just a guy that switched from Objective-C and PHP to Swift, and still consider myself a beginner.  I currently have one Swift app in the App Store, and it's made about $120 in the past six months (so, I'm pretty much rich now /s).  It's ugly, inefficient, and I know that I can do way better next time!

378,1662,2017-07-23 22:35:40,21,29,"Hello everyone! I'm Joannis, most commonly known as the developer of MongoKitten. Today I plan to announce OpenKitten is widening in the Server Side Swift scene.

As of a few months I've been working slowly but surely to develop an ecosystem in Swift. There are no C dependencies except SSL. The performance is amazing, topping above all other tools consistently. Our MongoDB driver is 2x faster than the competition as is the web server and framework.

Many features and docs are still missing, where docs are being worked on now. I plan to work full-time for the coming 3 months at least to develop this ecosystem as a worthy competitor to all current Server Side Swift frameworks.

All parts of the ecosystem support an easy an performant asynchronous API that doesn't add ""code pyramids"" and, of course, doesn't block the thread.

I think I've got a nice set of features lined up that will (hopefully) revolutionise the current state of Server Side Swift.

**In general**

OpenKitten's full ecosystem will rely on Swift 4. That means Codable are constantly supported. By making common objects such as Request/Response, JSON and Models encodable, simple operations such as logging become really easy and powerful.

SSL on macOS is done through Security, so you don't need to install *any* additional packages from Brew. If you're running Swift 4, you're good to go, no additional requirements.

On Linux, OpenSSL will be integrated with, this required `libssl-dev` to be installed so the headers are available and Swift 4 will be used, too, after that you're good to go.

Swift 4 is the target, currently. All OpenKitten projects will support 3.0 and above. Swift 3.1 and 3.2/4.0 will get some extra features. Where Swift 3.1 adds simpler literals, 3.2/4.0 will add codable support to the ecosystem. Before the final release, 4.0 will be the only supported Swift version to ensure fast development.

**HTTP**

[Lynx, a high performance HTTP framework with web server capabilities](https://github.com/openkitten/lynx), reaching 2x the performance of other tested Swift ecosystems in synchronous behaviour. Asynchronous is exceeding even that.

[Puma, a Lynx based HTTP client](https://github.com/OpenKitten/Puma), still in an early stage, but definitely part of the family.

[Leopard, a Lynx based ](https://github.com/OpenKitten/Leopard), with a comparable API to Vapor, though more performant and more integrated with other OpenKitten tools.

Puma integrates with Lynx so it better fits in with Lynx and Leopard. I don't think Puma would be used on the frontend.

**MongoDB**

[MongoKitten, a pure swift MongoDB client](https://github.com/OpenKitten/MongoKitten), beats other drivers by 50-200%.

[Meow, the codable ORM](https://github.com/OpenKitten/Meow), requires a single line of code to make your models usable. Ensures reusability of models to iOS projects and keeps your code as clean as it should be.

**Other tools**

[Cheetah, JSON](https://github.com/OpenKitten/Cheetah), it's JSON, done by OpenKitten. The only real bonus is it's OpenKitten integration and codable support.

[Ocelot, Codable JWT](https://github.com/OpenKitten/Ocelot), because it's codable, messages that get decoded are verified before becoming accessible, ensuring invalid tokens get rejected transparently.

For SQL I'd recommend other ecosystem's solutions. I cannot guarantee quality tools for SQL, so I'd point to solutions such as Vapor/Perfect/Kitura database adapters instead. This doesn't mean that the web server can't be used with other ecosystems, it just means that SQL and an ORM aren't developed by OpenKitten.

OpenKitten's MongoKitten is actively used by many developers from the other ecosystems, too!

**Contributing**

Contributors are welcome. As the ecosystem is still getting winded up, people joining now can have influence in decisions that power the ecosystem's future. Whether people join in, or not, OpenKitten will be developed for as it has been for the past 2 years.

Contributors are welcome [at slack](https://slackpass.io/openkitten) or [on github](https://github.com/OpenKitten/). And any kind of contribution is welcome, especially issues. Since not know what's wrong is worse than doing something wrong.

I'm working on an generic implementation of a [dichotomic search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomic_search) that would work for various types (at least `Integer` and `FloatingPoint` types for now).

As it is, it works well:

    func dichomoticSearch&lt;T: DichomoticSearchable&gt;(range: ClosedRange&lt;T&gt;, isUpperBound: (T) -&gt; Bool, tolerance: T) -&gt; T {
        if range.upperBound &lt;= range.lowerBound + tolerance {

        }
        let middle = T.middle(range)
        if isUpperBound(middle) {
            return dichomoticSearch(range: range.lowerBound...middle, isUpperBound: isUpperBound, tolerance: tolerance)
        } else {
            return dichomoticSearch(range: middle...range.upperBound, isUpperBound: isUpperBound, tolerance: tolerance)
        }
    }

But for testing purposes, I wanted to print the number of iterations performed to find the solution, so I embedded my recursive function in another function to add a parameter to keep track of the iterations:

    func dichomoticSearch2&lt;T: DichomoticSearch &gt;(range: ClosedRange&lt;T&gt;, isUpperBound: (T) -&gt; Bool, tolerance: T) -&gt; T {
        func _dichomoticSearch2&lt;T: DichomoticSearch &gt;(range: ClosedRange&lt;T&gt;, isUpperBound: (T) -&gt; Bool, tolerance: T, numberOfIterations: Int) -&gt; T {
            if range.upperBound &lt;= range.lowerBound + tolerance {
                print(""number of ierations: \(numberOfIterations)"")
                return range.lowerBound
            }
            let middle = T.middle(range)
            if isUpperBound(middle) {
                return _dichomoticSearch2(range: range.lowerBound...middle, isUpperBound: isUpperBound, tolerance: tolerance, numberOfIterations: numberOfIterations + 1)
            } else {
                return _dichomoticSearch2(range: middle...range.upperBound, isUpperBound: isUpperBound, tolerance: tolerance, numberOfIterations: numberOfIterations + 1)
            }
        }

I need to be able to do full text search and filtering child values on message objects, but firebase doesn't allow it, nor does the built-in firebase persistence function (it's essentially a black box, with no access to whatever database it uses).  

My proposed solution is to 1) disable firebase persistence and 2) store data locally in some sort of database. The data will be extremely simple - just a dictionary of type   
      [ConversationID: [MessageID: MessageModel]]  
where ConversationID and MessageID are strings, and MessageModel is a struct with string and integer properties (that I would like to filter and do text search on).  

Which database would be the best fit here? I'm trying to avoid SQL/CoreData because a) I don't know anything about the frameworks and b) they seem to be intended for much more complicated uses, and I'm trying to keep it simple. NSCoding is obviously out because it doesn't allow querying. I looked into Realm, but it seems to be just as complicated as CoreData, and intended for different use cases.

398,85,2017-07-31 12:19:18,64,9,"I am pleased to announce that Outcome v2, rewritten to fulfil the Boost peer review feedback from May and only reaching feature completeness three weeks ago, has been successfully deployed into two complex libraries which were heavily using Outcome v1. Lots of bug fixes and maturity has resulted, and if you were holding off on deploying Outcome into your own code until now, now is the time!

The code itself is now ready for a second Boost peer review, it has all the same testing that v1 had, and I am highly confident as to its quality. What solely remains before Outcome v2 can reenter the Boost peer review queue for a second review is the documentation which remains parlous (and any help with it is greatly appreciated!), and the ""Boostification"" cronjob script as the peer review wants a ""pure Boost"" submission. I am also going to have to fix a number of bugs in Standardese the documentation tool first, it currently segfaults when fed the Outcome headers :). @foonathan's tool shows lots of promise, it does far better with C++ 17 than doxygen, just need to shave off some rough edges in the tool.

What comes before that though is writing a WG21 paper P0762R0 summarising the Boost peer review which led to the stripped down, barebones v2 `result&lt;T, E&gt;` design and the rationale for the design deviations from `expected&lt;T, E&gt;` as according to the Boost peer review feedback. If WG21 feel warm feelings about a `std::result&lt;T, E&gt;` after reading P0762R0, then I will prepare a formal standardisation proposal for the Library Evolution Working Group (LEWG) and get the ball rolling for standardisation by attending meetings from 2018 onwards until it's through. I'll announce any draft D0762R0 here when it's ready for people to comment and give feedback on soon.

My thanks to everyone here on Reddit, on boost-dev, on SG14 low latency, and privately who have helped out with testing, documentation, and so much more in making this library happen. I know those coming from Rust-land feel amazement how long it has taken C++ to replicate Rust's `Result&lt;T, E&gt;`, but I'm very sure ours is enormously superior to theirs already simply by doing so much less because it doesn't need to. Taking time to get design **right** is one of the big things which continues to separate C++ from the upstart systems programming languages. Long may it continue!

--- context ---

Outcome provides a C++ 14 STL-quality `result&lt;T, EC&gt;` and an `outcome&lt;T, EC, E&gt;` implementation of success|failure value transports, and is expected to pass a second Boost peer review and be submitted for C++ standardisation as the lowest level of an overall framework as proposed by:

- http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0650r0.pdf C++ Monadic interface
- http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0323r2.pdf A proposal to add a utility class to represent expected object (Revision 4)

The idea is that result/outcome are the extremely lightweight struct-like success|failure value transports suitable for usage in public APIs, whereas expected is the much richer variant-like monadic success|failure value transports, and everything participates together under P0650R0.

Outcome is a pure header only library with no dependencies. It works best with C++ 17 and Concepts enabled, but can work with C++ 14 on these compilers or better:

- clang 4.0 (5.0 required for Windows)
- GCC 7

(VS2017 Update 3 RTM is supposed to work too according to Microsoft, my thanks to them for swiftly fixing the several ICEs I reported)

I tend to adhere pretty strongly to the object oriented paradigm. As long as something is represented as an object I can understand it. Although that should also be the case with Swift, I'm having trouble applying that logic to the examples and tutorials I find. Taking a very specific example from the app I am slowly building, Apple's Core Data Programming guide recommends this for creating a new instance:

    let employee = NSEntityDescription.insertNewObjectForEntityForName(""Employee"", inManagedObjectContext: managedObjectContext) as! EmployeeMO

Most tutorials I find use this approach but I find it difficult to understand. After a minute of searching, I found another example from [Michal Svěrák](https://medium.com/@MichalSverak/coredata-and-swift-3-c135822250ce) that also creates an Managed Object instance:

    let task = Task(context:context)

Why isn't the second approach used more often and why isn't the Apple Core Data programming guide updated to use this simpler approach? I find the second approach much easier to understand than the first since it is very clear that you are creating an instance of Task. Why must you go through NSEntityDescription and then typecast the resulting instance when you can just create the instance directly? Are there any advantages to using the first approach? Approaches like these are used often throughout iOS app development and for some reason I can't wrap my head around it. Wouldn't you want to abstract all NS classes when possible?

My code can be found here: https://gist.github.com/gwcates/19638d425d586f4b32b81985e3150e4e

**My ""Understanding"":**    
So the main view is a custom dynamic view table with each cell representing a task with a UIButton to the left that allows the user to trigger whether or not the task as been completed (http://imgur.com/a/kxsZA). The cell is downcast as ToDoCell. 

As I understand it, the reason a delegate method is needed is because the user needs to be able to trigger the `isComplete` property in ToDoCell, but ToDoCell does not have any access to the model. Hence, I create a protocol `ToDoCellDelegate` which requires a function that does something once the button is tapped:

    protocol ToDoCellDelegate: class {
        func checkmarkTapped(sender: ToDoCell)
    }

I'm not certain why I have to create a `delegate` variable of type `ToDoCellDelegate`? I think it's so that I have some way of calling the function..?

I am also create an `IBAction` in `ToDoCell` for when the button is tapped, which calls `delegate?.checkMarkTapped(sender: self)`. I'm assuming this is what calls the `checkMarkTapped( )` function, but does `self` refer to `ToDoCell.swift` or `ToDoTableViewController.swift` (which creates the instance of `ToDoCell`)?

Now, I have to add the protocol to `ToDoTableViewController.swift`, because this is the controller that draws the cell...? I also have to define the function `checkMarkTapped(sender: ToDoCell)` to adhere to the protocol.

**Question:**    
I suppose my main question is, if I were developing this on my own, what would have indicated to me that a delegate protocol was necessary? Secondly, how exactly do all the pieces fit together? Is my understanding on the right path?

I apologize if this post is non-sequitur at points -- I'm really struggling with this concept. Any clarification would be greatly appreciated!",Can we talk about Delegates for a second? (Trying to solidify understand via guided project)

You can check [my qualifications as an instructor here](https://medium.com/@frr149/learn-modern-ios-development-with-a-world-class-trainer-developer-d00f73a27f3e), but in a nutshell, 

&gt;**I know how to teach nerdy stuff in a fun and efficient way**. ;-)

In the past, I worked as an advanced iOS instructor at the Big Nerd Ranch and as a course developer at Udacity.



**What will you learn**

In this course you will learn all the basics of iOS Development. We will set solid foundations upon which you can build a new career as an iOS Engineer.
Among the topics you will learn are:

* Swift 4. 
* The UIKit framework for developing iOS Apps, with Navigation controllers, TabBarControllers, SplitViewControllers, TableViews, CollectionViews and more.
* The architecture of well designed iOS Apps with the MVC design pattern and communication mechanisms such as target/action, delegates, notifications and closures.
* Creating Universal apps: applications that run both on iPhones and iPads.
* Using autolayout to create adaptive UIs (without going crazy) ;-)
* The best practices and design patterns to create world class software, such as: functional programming in Swift, TDD, Singletons, delegates, factories, actors, promises and more.

As a bonus, that is not usually included in our Junior iOS Engineer course, you will get an introduction to concurrent programming with GCD (grand central dispatch), JSON processing in Swift and consuming web services.

&gt; All of this be taught in a nerd-friendly and fun way that will keep you engaged, motivated, and entertained.

**What you will be able to do?**

Upon finishing this course you will have built a solid foundation that will allow you to either:

* Get a job as a junior iOS Engineer at any of the best iOS shops in the world
take more specialized courses on advanced topics such as apple watch, ARKit, CoreML, etc.
* All of our students (12k+)who took the previous versions of our courses, not only got jobs as iOS developers, but became the lead developers in their companies in a year on average.


**What should you pledge?**
It depends on your goals. Here is my personal recomendation:

* If you are a hobbyist, pledge as a Codemaester. You’ll get the best value for the non professional developer.
* If you are serious about starting a career as an iOS Developer, pledge as Qyburn. Not only will you receive the full online course, but you will be able to take it at our premises in the Silicon Valley. This will provide you with an unmatched networking opportunity with recruiters and startups.

**Requirements**
This course requires that you have some previous programming experience. Any object oriented language will do.

**What if you don’t have any programming experience?**
No sweat! You can still pledge and in the meantime, take my free online course for total beginners: [“Coding Essentials in Swift 4”](https://medium.com/coding-essentials-in-swift/free-swift-course-for-total-beginners-ecb5b6a03b01).

Results showed some stark differences between software communities, for example:
[Making updates available to end users quickly](http://breakingapis.org/survey/values.html#rapid?ecos=Haskell_Stack_Stackage_,Node_js_NPM,Ruby_Rubygems) was highly valued by Node and Ruby communities, but was considered less important to Eclipse.  The Perl and Eclipse communities value [stability](http://breakingapis.org/survey/values.html#stability?ecos=Eclipse_plugins_,Haskell_Cabal_Hackage_,Perl_CPAN) most, while Hackage/Cabal valued it least.

Ecosystems have very different ways of dealing with versioning; for example in Go it's common for people to sometimes [make small updates without increasing the version number](http://breakingapis.org/survey/upstream.html#mon_versionless_updates_eco?ecos=Go,Maven,Node_js_NPM).  In Rust, developers more frequently chip in and [help with maintenance of upstream packages](http://breakingapis.org/survey/downstream.html#sync_liaison_code?ecos=NuGet,Rust_Cargo) than in NuGet. 

There are a lot of other results on the linked site, and we’re interested in your impressions of the results.  Do the results make sense to you?  What answers would you have expected?  Do you think the differences are intentional?  If you have any thoughts about it I’ll try to keep up with comments here, or you can also send us comments through the website.

How does one go about creating a full level? Anything I've made so far stays in the same part of the scene the whole time. I see that I can make the scene bigger, and have played around with moving a camera around a bigger scene. But for a full level, do I just make one super huge scene? And I've been doing everything in code mostly, but I would think a full level would likely need to use the scene editor?

I've also seen something involving tiles using a separate tile editor, not sure if that is common or good to use. Just trying to figure out the direction to go instead of trying it on my own and having some abstract way of doing things.

This and any tips related would be greatly appreciated.",How to go about creating different levels?

I’m 21, college dropout, and I still live with my parents. I was going to college hated it and decided it wasn’t for me,  I really wanted/want to be an iOS developer(freelance and my friends and I have some good ideas) the only problem is that I’m not that skilled. My friend who’s been coding with objective c for 7 years And swift since it came out, is trying to help me learn swift but it’s not that easy and it gets frustrating. Rn I’m learning from the Stanford course and I’ll probably take another course online after if I don’t feel comfortable. I also work a job that I hate, I don’t talk to my coworkers and I just rather leave I’ve been working for this grocery store for 2 years(2 different stores) and everyday I go to work it motivates me to continue practicing/learning so I can quit my job. I’m really tempted to just giving my two weeks Asap and just keep learning and put all my time into just learning. I don’t really have any expenses besides gas I live with my parents. I’ve been thinking about it for awhile now and I just wonder how my life would turn out if I just risked it and went all in.

I can say for certain that this issue is directly related to the gif.  If there's no gif, there's no problem.  Also, if I take only the code related to the gif and put it in a separate, unrelated project, the gif setup works just fine.  But I can't figure out what I'm missing otherwise.

We just open sourced our small layout library [Baya](https://github.com/getwagit/Baya)! Thought you guys might be interested.

So our small team mostly works without using Interface Builder. 
For one of our projects we tried to improve the readability of our layout code by refactoring the logic into structs. 

We basically defined portions of the layout – like the header, button groups, etc – and combined those parts into a tree structure. 
We like this way of writing layouts (or maybe we just got used to it) and put it in a lib to use it in other projects.

Here's what it looks like:

    let contentLayout = [imageView, subTitleLabel]
        .layoutLinearly(orientation: .vertical)
        .layoutGravitating(to: .centerY)
        .layoutMatchingParentHeight()

    let buttonsLayout = [button1, button2, button3]
        .layoutLinearly(orientation: .horizontal)
        .layoutGravitating(to: .centerX)
        .layoutMatchingParentWidth()
    
    let layout = contentLayout
        .layoutFlexible(
            elementBefore: navbarView,
            elementAfter: buttonsLayout 
            orientation: .vertical)
        .layoutMatchingParent()

468,89,2017-09-22 17:24:33,7,0,"Not sure if this is the best sub but a quick background on me*:

- BSc in CS 
- Programming in .NET (C#, MVC, WebAPI2, .NET Core, WCF) for over 4 years now
- Programming in Javascript (ES6/7, React/Redux, TypeScript, little Angular 2)
- SQL Server (and some legacy IBM mainframe stuff, but not huge on DB's and I feel like the NoSQL wave is starting to settle a bit)

Now - the problem is I still feel too boxed in as mainly a Web Dev. I love .NET / C# / Javascript and will continue to learn them, but I am getting an itch for something a bit more complicated - working on projects that exercise the CS side of my brain. 

I want to become a developer who knows more than just web-dev, I hear old-school programmers talk about systems programming, or low-latency code, or even just listening to people like Vitalik talk on developing Ethereum makes me feel like I'm just stagnating in web development.

Does anyone else feel like this, and if so, where should I divert my 'fun learning time' (as opposed to necessary reading, lol). 

I was thinking of picking up Go/Rust/C/C++/Python/F# but not sure what best compliments my current skill-set - one caveat is I would like it to add to my CV rather than being so quirky that it's not going to help much professionally. 

Go/Rust/C -&gt; Systems Programming, could try and think of some cool projects to work on and I feel like this will open up a world of development decisions I have never had to consider before, and make me a much more respectable programmer in doing so. Learning C to me feels like the equivalent of learning High English without modern day colloquialisms.

C++ -&gt; I started programming with C++ and then swiftly moved to C# and didn't look back, but I think it's sort of a 'middle-ground' of having to start thinking about memory management, but I feel like I'd rather learn something a bit more, modern. 

Python -&gt; I've secretly wanted to learn Python for years and never made the jump, it just seems like SO many things are written in it, and it can do nearly everything - just not sure if it's going to scratch the particular itch I've been feeling.

F# -&gt; Going back to the professional argument, it would appear Haskell isn't worth learning, but F# is picking up a lot in the UK, and it would be fun to take the FRP paradigm of React and go the whole-hog and try and write F# with as little leaning on the .NET framework as possible - but again whilst it might be cool, and definitely shape me as a developer, will it give me a much deeper understanding of my craft?

Sorry if this is a ramble, I've got a long holiday coming up soon and am thinking it's the perfect time to try something new! 

Thanks!

            case id
            case name
            case rating
            case imageURL = ""image_url""

    init(fromService service: Business) {
            //Ignore the fact I'm not using guard, I'll refactor after this is fixed
            self.id = service.id
            self.name = service.name

            self.phoneNumber = service.phoneNumber
            self.imageURL = service.imageURL
        }
    }

My expectation is that since imageURL is optional, passing nil to it should be fine but that isn't what happens. If its nil, then I get the localized error of: ""The data couldn’t be read because it isn’t in the correct format."" 

I do know that this is due to trying to convert the string from the JSON to a URL, but since URL has an optional initializer I'm not sure why this would fail. (Storing the URL as a string works fine, but I'd rather store it as a URL).

Am I missing something obvious here? 


EDIT: It occurred to me I may be misunderstanding the JSON Decodable stuff. I think maybe I have to have my structs match the JSON's type and then make a new struct that stores the info I want in the format that I want and keep BusinessService and Business for grabbing the JSON only.",Why is my JSON failing?

I'll be testing this when I get some time later this week, so if no one answers before then I'll report back.

502,672,2017-10-24 07:59:53,8,1,"Hi everyone , the purpose of this post is i would like advice for my next stage in my programming journey/career. My first language i learned was c++. I learned to do algorithm and data structures, which taught me how to program and the tools of programming. 
Rite after college i began to teach myself swift. The last four months i have been going over numerous tutorials. I started with raywenderlich book “Apprentice”. While i was reading that book i watch the Stanford courses. I literally watch the Stanford courses probably 4 times through. I like to read the tutorial written by Paul Hudson “Hacking with Swift” during down time. I recently started Angela Yu course on Udemy. I skipped a bunch of sections that i already felt comfortable with. At this exact point i am really focusing on the Networking in Swift course on Udacity, i think that course is awesome. 
With all this being said, i still haven’t found confidence or a regular routine. I understand the concept “build something on your own” but i have no ideas. Some of the things i definitely need to start doing is Open source/github. Github intimidates me to the max. I don’t know where to start or even how to contribute to a project. I understand basic terminal commands but won’t ever touch github yet. 
With all this being said , if someone could give me advice in regards to the next step and what else should i learn. Also if you could throw in some SDK that you use on a regular basis that would be awesome. Thanks ",Swift Journey Advice ??

I am trying to create a small program to assign essays from one peer to a reviewer. Both peer and reviewer pertain to the same group that can be even or odd numbered. The odd case should not be assigned to any reviewer. The tool will be used to help colleagues train their collaboration abilities and make suggestion to their peer essays.

The documents should be anonymized and then passed to a random colleague, who will be the reviewer for that document.

Also, the documents are small markdown files with yaml blocks at the top, which holds author and email (keys that should not be passed forward to the reviewer).

I have advanced the code a bit, however the randomization has been a pain. THIS TOOL SHOULD RUN ON LINUX MACHINES, thus arc4random should not be used.

                let d: IndexDistance = numericCast(Int(random() % numericCast(unshuffledCount) + 1 ))
                let i = index(firstUnshuffled, offsetBy: d)
                swapAt(firstUnshuffled, i)
            }

    }

In the code above I successfully anonymized the documents, but couldn't randomize the assignment (shuffle) between peer and respective reviewer.

Here are three documents for testing:

-

    ---
    # Metadata
    title: My third essay
    author: userA
    email: userA@gmail.com
    ---

    email: userB@gmail.com
    ---

    ---
    # Metadata
    title: My third essay
    author: userC
    email: userC@gmail.com

New swift developer here, I have a tableview where when I select a column I would like to highlight the word of the column within a Text Field. I have two ways of doing it but failing at both. (On MacOS)

attrbutedStringValue
I have tried the code below and although it works, the textbox text will word-wrap and lose its font settings(which I fixed). I am assuming all formatting is lost when attributedStringValue is used? Wondering what I'm missing here:

       let varDescription = arrFields[tblField.selectedRow]*
       let range = (txtTextBox.stringValue as NSString).range(of: varDescription)*
       let txtTextBoxString = NSMutableAttributedString(string:txtTextBox.stringValue)*
       let myRange = (txtTextBox.stringValue as NSString).range(of: txtTextBox.stringValue)*
       let anotherAttribute = [ NSAttributedStringKey.font: NSFont(name: ""System Font"", size: 14.0)! ]*
       txtTextBoxString.addAttribute(NSAttributedStringKey.foregroundColor, value: NSColor.red , range: range)*
       txtTextBoxString.addAttributes(anotherAttribute, range: myRange)*
       txtTextBox.attributedStringValue = txtTextBoxString*

The other option is highlighting the text within the Text Field. Doing: *txtTextBox.selectText(nil)* highlights everything, but *txtTextBox.selectText(txtTextBox.stringValue .range(of: ""Text""))* does also unfortunately. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have been scratching my head on this for a long time and spinning my wheels.

528,90,2017-11-10 11:38:32,1,5,"I'm using an MVVM implementation I pieced together with some help from a fellow reddit user and blog articles. It works pretty well and even handles async operations.

Here's the `AwaitableDelegateCommand` MVVM stuff  
https://hastebin.com/mizuwequlo.swift (weird how hastebin marks it as swift code)

Implementation of one such command looks like this:

    public ICommand SaveContactsCommand =&gt; new AwaitableDelegateCommand&lt;Window&gt;(SaveContacts);
    private async Task SaveContacts(Window wdw)
    {
        try
        {

        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Pokemon(ex); // giggity
        }
    }

This obviously doesn't implement IProgress to update the UI showing progress of the async operations.

According to [this page on Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap#progress-reporting-optional), IProgress should be passed into the async function as a parameter which I'd ideally do more or less as follows:

    public ICommand SaveContactsCommand =&gt; new AwaitableDelegateCommand&lt;Window, IProgress&gt;(SaveContacts);
    private async Task SaveContacts(Window wdw, IProgress p)
    {

    }

I'm having 2 problems here:

1. My `AwaitableDelegateCommand` doesn't support a 2nd parameter, and
2. I'm not understanding based on the article that I linked how to complete the IProgress implementation. There was stuff in there about cancellation tokens and whatever else and it just went way over my head.

If I had a progress bar, how would I use IProgress here to indicate progress while reading a file (for example)?",[TAP] Using IProgress to update the UI during async operations

543,1442,2017-11-20 06:40:36,12,4,"I have been working on a project that requires our users to change their DNS nameservers to the one we provide. We need this because we do content filtering (block of explicit / adult content) at the DNS level.

&lt;context&gt;
We spent the last 6+ months crawling and categorizing sites, building an anycast network and creating a stable DNS resolver service. We launched[1] a couple of months ago and got a few schools to use our product, along with many families. So far, so good as it is easy to change the DNS servers on a router, Windows, Linux (/etc/resolv.conf) or on the Mac ( networksetup ). 

However, on the iphone/ipad, it has been troubling. The parents have to change the DNS for every wifi network and if the child have 3g/4g, there is no way to change the DNS servers.

So I started my quest to learn swift and build my first iPhone/iPad app that will allow the parents to easily change the DNS servers for all Wifi networks and 3g. 

&lt;/context end&gt;

Sorry for the long intro, but wanted to provide context, so you understand the end goal. Can someone point me into the right direction on how to do these things using Swift for the iOS platform?

* Programatically change DNS server on all wifi networks (or at least the active one). 
* Programatically change DNS server on 3g.
* Force DNS changes to stay on even when the app is closed.
* Force DNS changes to be loaded when the iPhone/ipad is booted.

I have been looking and researching and I can not find the right library/function that allows me to do that. Some places mentioned that jailbroken iOS can modify /etc/resolv.conf, but I need this to work on non-jailbroken devices. On other places it says that the iOS does not support changing the nameservers - which doesn't make much sense as there are a few apps in the AppStore for changing the DNS. 

I assume I must be missing something. I hope this question is ok here and I apologize in advance if I missed something obvious. 

*[1] link to project: https://cleanbrowsing.org*


thanks!

544,1441,2017-11-21 00:40:06,9,7,"Hi, I'm trying to write an app using ncurses which I wanted to compile on both MacOS and Linux. This is mainly for educational purposes at this point.

On the MacOS side of things I did the following steps:
* installed ncurses using brew (brew install ncurses); 
* Created a swift package to wrap ncurses using a modulemap (I called it Cncurses)
* Created another swift package containing a library which should use Cncurses

I can successfully build my packages and even import Cncurses but there doesn't seem to be any imported definitions.
On some examples I found they suggest importing Darwin.ncurses, which is not ideal because I want it to be cross-platform (unless I use some conditional imports using ""macros""). Still, shouldn't I be able to use ncurses through my Cncurses system package? What am I doing wrong?

Thanks!
",ncurses Linux/MacOS - what am I doing wrong?
545,1440,2017-11-21 22:15:18,18,3,"Disclaimer: I am a noob.

So, my current objective is to figure out a good way to connect an iOS app to a MySQL database. I have to be able to view, edit, and add information to the database. I have the database all set up and everything locally with tables and some data in them as well. I followed a couple different tutorials about how to get the data from the database to no avail.

Of everything I saw, the hardest part seemed to be just to get the PHP file correct in order for the database to give the data. I used one that seemed like it would work, but instead returns a blank page rather than the data I request. Another I plugged in and it turns out it is written in older PHP that is no longer supported. I tried changing to a newer form, but I don't know PHP and it quickly became too much work for me to do with my very limited knowledge of PHP.

So, as far as this part goes, I have yet to successfully use a PHP file to extract data from the database.

I came across a few different GitHub projects that deal with MySQL. The simplest one that seemed to do everything I need was [DRDatabase](https://github.com/danielriege/DRDatabase). This is the one that needs an updated PHP file. I later saw [MySqlSwiftNative](https://github.com/mcorega/MySqlSwiftNative). This one... I'm not sure about... Even the name seems strange. Honestly haven't looked a lot into this one yet, but I'm not very optimistic about it. Possibly the best-documented one I've seen is [GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift), but I'm not sure how to connect to an external database and this one doesn't specifically mention MySQL.

So, I am pretty stinking lost right now. I have the database but that's about it. I need to be able to connect to it, but I haven't gotten that to work yet. After I get that, I need to figure out the best way to make a simple app to connect to it, view the data, and edit or add other data. I have the entire idea in my head, but I have no clue where to go. I have also seen people talk about using a REST API to connect to a database from an app, but I am lost about that too.

Any suggestions to get a connection going?

-----

Summary of questions:

1. What is a working way to read data from a MySQL database into an iOS app using Swift?

2. What is the best way to execute SQL commands to a MySQL server using Swift?

3. What else can I use to make this whole process easier? Frameworks or APIs or whatever.

4. Any suggestions for the app design other than using a TableView? I want it to be simple but effective and clean.","Needing help with Swift, iOS, MySQL, and who knows what else..."

I'm fairly new to swift and have just been dabbling but not new to OOP in general.  I'm working on an app for my residents to help with critical events and how to treat them.  I started with a simple Table View Controller nested in a Navigation Controller and populated it with an Array of critical events which when touched would move to a Detailed Table View of the treatment of that event.  Simple enough.  My array contained the eventName, eventType, eventTreatment1, eventTreatment2, etc... so I used this to populate the first view with just the event names and the second  detail view with the treatments. 
 However some of the treatments require more detail and depth and would benefit from being able to be expanded or transition to a third table with more detail, though not all require this and it seems my array implementation is not an effective way to accomplish this. 
Would love to hear if someone has thoughts on a more efficient way to accomplish this. Thanks!

Im a novice programmer that soon has finished 1, 5 years of studies in app-development with swift as ONE of the SIX languages we tackled. Prior to this I had no experiance programming. So I'm very new to this, and I hope you can help me. 


I have an array that looks like this 
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6 ...... etc etc etc milions of numbers. But we dont know excactly how many.

Currently I am checking it and how many occurencies of each number I get. 
        
          if item == “4” {                
                numberOf4 = numberOf4 + 1
                
          }
            else if item == “6"" {          
               numberOf6 = numberOf6 + 1
            }
            else if item == “7” {            
               numberOf7 = numberOf7 + 1
            }

If I now want to also know how many times a 6 has **repeated** until the next number of the array was a 4 or a 7. How would I do that in a smart , simple , elegant way?


Im trying to think of a way to do this with Apples own librarys, but I cant find anything that really suits my needs. For example:


""func index(where: (Element) -&gt; Bool)
Returns the first index in which an element of the collection satisfies the given predicate."" - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array


Anyone had a similar problem that can show me in the right direction? :)

I have to add some gesture recognizers to a view controller that is a culprit. I could simply add add a MARK to separate this logic but I don’t really want to add 50+ extra lines. What I was thinking of doing was adding a new file (UserControls.swift) and putting it in a group with the corresponding view controller and then just extending the vc with the functionality in that file. Is this a viable solution regarding project architecture? My other option would be subclassing the view with the recognizers, but I think the former approach might be easier to navigate as our view group is in a totally different part of the file navigator.

I have recently started coding swift and am having a few issues understanding the dismiss() function, although from what I read online it should just be as easy as entering dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil) into the code. 


Please note that not only am I new to swift, but this is the first time I have used xCode before and also the first time I have properly used a mac computer. 


Basically, I have made myself a single view app that displays information. When I click a button, a new view controller pops up and displays further detailed information. I have got the button to work, presenting the view controller the way I want to which is great. I have created a button at the bottom that dismisses the view controller, however when I test it and click the button, it dismissed the view controller behind it (i.e the main view controller goes black)


Is someone able to assist? If screen shots are needed for further information I can post them on request.

Basically let's pretend I want to add a method `dismissPresented(sender: UIStoryboardSegue` to automatically allow an unwind segue. 

I would write this in UsefulControllerProtocol.swift

    protocol UsefulController {
        func dismissPresented(sender: UIStoryboardSegue)
    }
    
    extension UsefulController {
       func dismissPresented(sender: UIStoryboardSegue) {

And then when I want to add that functionality to my view controller I would do

    class IncrediblyUsefulViewController: UIViewController, UsefulController {
    
    }

to have all the useful functionality I added to the protocol default implementation.

BUT, two problems here:

1. I need this method to be `@IBAction` to be able to do stuff from the Interface Builder, but can't do that since Xcode is quick to tell me that only member functions can be `@IBAction` and it makes sense. 

2. How would I handle the overriding of a method from a protocol? for example if I wanted to override `prepare(for segue:)` or `viewDidLoad()` from the protocol, could I do that?",Protocol default implementation and ViewControllers

Let's assume we have a data model that resembles a person. A person as we all know have a first name and an age. Knowing this, I would create two variables within my Person class that are non-optionals. 

The argument here from the server side API developer is that even though the values should always exist, that the Swift client should declare those variables as optionals anyway and safely unwrap them before using them just to be safe just in case the server returns some bad data. 

**So it is better to:**

* Be defensive and try to recover from an undefined state if the server happens to send back bad data?

     *or*

* Give up and crash?

I totally agree that crashing is bad but in order to use Swift the way it was full heartedly meant to be used, wouldn't #2 be the Swift way to do things?

**Here are a few reasons I believe why:**

* Don't we want to define variables as non-optionals if in fact they should always be non-optionals in order for our app to 100% properly function? If not, then we are losing one of Swift's most powerful concepts and features and have no reason to use Swift over any other language. 

* Undefined states lead to really hard to track down bugs, may lead to unwanted code execution and employing defensive programming will just lead to code that is hard to reason about. (Taken directly from [this article](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/handling-non-optional-optionals-in-swift)

* Shouldn't the server have the responsibility of validating values before it sends it back in a JSON response?

For practice I'm trying to show two videos side by side, i.e. one is on the screen and playing, then when you swipe to the side the current one pauses, the new one shows and begins playing, and vice versa.

I currently have this working using swipe view controller, and it works fine.

As i'm new to swift I'm just trying to think if there is a better way to do this?  Using table view, or collection view?

Currently I have both videos loading prior to either showing, so they're both constantly there and waiting.  If I used a table view with dequereusablecells - as far as I know - the videos would only be loaded as i'm swiping to them.  Would this then prevent the video resuming from where it was once you swipe away and then back to it?

But to my understanding fetching live data is limited to a certain amount of request per minute or per ten minutes (or for any specified period of time) for most apis. In other words for *most* apis, you cannot *constantly* fetch live data. 

&amp;nbsp;

How can i make an app that constantly updates live data. For example, I have an app called CoinCap (can't link it due to rules of this sub) . it basically updates cryptocurrency prices live. I looked more into this and found an html api [here](https://www.bitstamp.net/api/). For those who aren't familiar, BitStamp is a popular cryptocurrency exchange. Anyhow, I understand how to use this api and create a simple app that can fetch data from this api but again, it limits the amount of requests per specified time period (in this specific api allows no more than 600 requests per 10 minutes). Although, that is still a lot of requests I want a truly live updating app. Long story short, I highly don't think apps like CoinCap (or any constantly live updating data app) uses the api request method but correct me if I am wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

 I want to learn how to do this so, lets say I want to make a very simple version of this coincap app that only updates live prices of bitcoin rather than the hundreds of different cryptocurrencies they update in their app. But I want my app to *constantly* update the price of bitcoin live. How would I do this? I looked further into the BitStamp website and found [this page](https://www.bitstamp.net/websocket/) which seems to have actual live updating data. I think this is what i would use rather than an api to create my app but I have no idea if this is the correct way to make such an app, let alone implement it.

Pasting a comment I made explaining what I need to do:

In Node when you try to read a file without providing an encoding type it returns a Buffer object. I'm pretty sure this would be called the same thing in Swift so I'll be using that.

What I need to do:

I need to read my file into a buffer (and preferably not the entire file) and with that buffer I need to extract specific bytes. Specially I need to get a 32 bit byte at the offset of 8. We'll call the value from this publicKeyLength

Then I need to slice the original buffer at index 16 and with a length of 16 + publicKeyLength. With this new buffer I need to convert it to a base64 string.

Hope that makes sense...

Any help would be appreciated!

I am trying to replicate this Javascript/Node code into Swift:

    fs.readFile(""/path/specialFile.ext"", function(err, buff) {
        var publicKeyLength = buff.readUInt32LE(8);
    
        var metaOffset = 16;
        var publicKey = new Buffer(buff.slice(metaOffset, metaOffset + publicKeyLength)).toString('base64');

Im making a swift app in Xcode that makes use of a cocapod called HNKWordLookup (originally written in objective c). This pod uses the WordNik API to return a random word. My only issue is that a lot of the words that are returned are quite obscure.

I figured that I could go to the http://developer.wordnik.com/docs page and set parameters there, and then be given a Request URL that caters to these parameters . I assume I need to put this into my code somewhere in place of another URL that is present within the pre written pod, but I have no clue where to put the request URL. At first I put it in place in the following line of code which was located in the pod's .m file (""HNKLookup.m:):

 static NSString *const kHNKLookupBaseUrl = @""http://api.wordnik.com:80/v4"";
changing it to

static NSString *const kHNKLookupBaseUrl = @""http://api.wordnik.com:80/v4/words.json/randomWord?hasDictionaryDef=true&amp;excludePartOfSpeech=definite-article&amp;minCorpusCount=1&amp;maxCorpusCount=-1&amp;minDictionaryCount=30&amp;maxDictionaryCount=-1&amp;minLength=1&amp;maxLength=-1&amp;api_key=a2a73e7b926c924fad7001ca3111acd55af2ffabf50eb4ae5"";

So in the video I have enabled slow internet connection to see how the app behaves with slow internet connection. As you can see the poster of the movie is wrong multiple times if I have dragged further in the list without waiting previous images to load.

Correct me if I am wrong but here is why I think I am seeing this problem:

1. cell A comes to view so render it
2. start fetching remote image for cell A
3. user has scrolled so far that cell A is not in view anymore
4. put cell A to reuse queue (this means dequeueReusableCell can return cell A for other place in the list)
5. cell Z comes to view so render it
6. dequeueReusableCell returns same view that was used in cell A for cell Z
7. start fetching remote image for cell Z
8. at this point user is still seeing blank image because neither cell A or Z remote image request has came back yet
9. after 1 sec cell A remote image request comes back
10. cell A image is shown for cell Z
11. after 1 second cell Z image request comes back and right image is shown


If the above is correct then lets image next case:
Steps from 1-8 are the same

9. after 1 sec cell Z remote image request comes back
10. cell Z image is shown for cell Z
11. after 1 second cell A image request comes back and WRONG image is shown

So if first request is slower than second there is potential situation where wrong image will be rendered to the cell

1.Would this be the best way to receive data as opposed to sending the data through a 3rd party offering etc - just incase the user doesn't have email etc.

2. How could I track how many requests I have?  - using a database etc and keep this data in the app eg "" 12 people have requested portraits""

I am 22 years old and graduated in 2017 with a math/finance degree. I really did not enjoy finance as much as I thought I would. After I graduated, I kept thinking about the basic Python I learned during school and also VBA I learned in a financial modeling course. I kept pondering about the idea of how cool and empowered I felt with programming even though what I was taught was very simple. So I decided to just take the plunge and quit my consulting job and pursue iOS development a 100% which was just a niche of programming that I was very passionate about because, as a millennial, I grew up into the birth and evolution of mobile technologies. 

&amp;nbsp;

**I started a 100 day coding challenge** to Learn Swift/iOS development 45 days ago and I knew absolutely nothing in terms of programming prior to starting other than basic Python and VBA. Everyday I studied anywhere from 4-8 hours for 45 days. I've accumulated an estimate of 250-300 hours of studying/coding in the past 45 days. After the first month, I began applying because what did I have to lose? I applied to 61 different roles and got an interview with a firm that i will not disclose the name of, and after the interview they gave me an offer. I'm pretty surprised to be completely honest. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Stats:**

- Applications: 61
- Rejections: 7 
- Did not hear back: 53
- Offers: 1
- Total estimated accumulated study time: 250 ~ 300 hours
- Average daily study time: ~ 6 hours

Can anyone help me? I am trying to make an app that stores data of a team of characters.

I have created a basic flowchart of how the app works. [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d6rqEeRGwFnui2Y2VhjYpUy6pbJBQeEy/view?usp=sharing]

I need an array of teams which are created by the user, that displays in a tableview with the team names, clicking on one that takes you to another tableview that displays a list of the  names of all the team members, then clicking on a team member brings up a page with the team members stats.

I am trying to do this with an array of arrays and all sorts but feel like I am making it too difficult. Does anyone know how best to express this? Any examples that I could look at.

I have been coding on and off with swift for about 1 year and getting back into it full time. I have tried learning from courses to see if I can find a solution for me but no luck so far. 

I hope I have explained my problem well enough for someone to help.

701,1167,2018-03-20 16:48:57,6,2,"**Background info:**

Using [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) would be perfect for my next side project.

It will require a very simple backend, but I'd like to write it in Swift vs learning a new language (which will take a while and guarantee it's written poorly).

So far Lambda natively supports Java, Node.js, C#, Python and Go.

**What I got working:**

Following this blog post I was able to hack together getting a Swift project running on Lambda:
https://medium.com/@gigq/using-swift-in-aws-lambda-6e2a67a27e03

But I was never able to get external network requests working on it when running on Lambda (but did get them working in my Ubuntu dev environment).

I've also played around with [IBM Cloud Functions](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/functions), which I got working relatively easily. But I've found IBM Cloud to be a little shaky and unfinished.

**The actual question:**

Do you think Amazon ever will support Swift natively on AWS Lambda? And if you had to guess how soon do you think they'll add support for it?",Do you think Amazon will add a Swift runtime to AWS Lambda?

736,1749,2018-04-07 20:18:34,25,5,"Dear /r/Swift, 

I chose to learn Swift without a storyboard, simply because I don't like working with it on a 13-inch macbook pro. Yet I found out today that the segues were a very easy way of transferring data between viewcontrollers.

Right now I am trying to work my way through a tutorial (this one: https://cocoacasts.com/implement-the-nsfetchedresultscontrollerdelegate-protocol-with-swift-3), and they are using segues to pass data around. 

Now I know you can pass data to another ViewController when you define it, like so: 

    @objc func switchViewControllerToAddQuoteViewController() {
        let sendData = persistentContainer.viewContext
        let secondViewController = AddQuoteViewController()
        secondViewController.managedObjectContext = sendData
        self.present(secondViewController, animated: true)
        }

But is there an elegant way to get the data back to the first ViewController without segues? I obviously can't do it the same way, since I can't do a `mainViewController()` again. 

Delegates are too complicated for what I'm trying to achieve and I don't really know them all too well yet. Isn't there a better way to get it back to the first VC when I use `popViewController`?

Thanks in advance!",Getting data back to the previous ViewController (no storyboard)

As we all know BFS would provide the best solution to the problem as it’s searches all of the adjacent states until it finds the solution. An A* algorithm with a heuristic function (Manhattan distance) would speed up this process, meaning less nodes to search still and gives the best solution. 

Here’s my problem, my A* algorithm utilises a priority queue so every time a node is inserted into queue the priority queue would calculate the Manhattan distance, and re-order the nodes in terms of shortest distance first. This process has slow down the algorithm by a lot. As a result, the running of the A* algorithm is longer than the BFS.

I have a scroll view on a VC that I want to comprise of two other VC's, VC\-A and VC\-B.

My issue is that the scroll view only takes up a portion of the view on the VC, not the whole view.  So when I set the frame of the scroll view to the frame of the VC, it's not only allowing me to scroll left and right \(this is what I want\), it's also allowing me to scroll up and down as VC\-A and VC\-B are taller than the scroll view \(as it's not the full size of the view\).

I'm sure this is a super simple fix, but how do I sort it?  I've temporarily sorted it by hard coding a value for the height, but this obviously isn't ideal when it comes to using different sized devices.

749,1703,2018-04-16 17:21:34,5,3,"Hey guys --

I'm working on a rather large server-side Swift 4 project on macOS that will eventually be deployed on Linux.  It's making use of the Perfect framework for RESTful services, etc.  All of my dependencies are being managed using Swift Package Manager.  However, SPM is a huge pain in the butt to use!

With SPM, any time I add a new dependency I'm required to run swift package generate-xcodeproj.  That's all fine and good, except that SPM doesn't handle resources (plist files, for example) well.  So, any XCTestCases that make use of a resource start failing, unless I go back into Xcode and add a ""Copy Bundle Resources"" build phase manually.  (Which will then get removed the next time I run generate-xcodeproj)

Also, my project is divided into separate modules, all of which are local.  But, with SPM, I can't specify a local, relative path.  I have to use an absolute file path, and it has to point to a Git repo.  That's not terrible, unless I'm actively making changes to that repo and want to test those BEFORE I commit them.  

And on, and on, and on...  Does anyone have any better way to deal with Xcode and SPM?  It would be ideal if Xcode was smart enough to recognize changes to the Package.swift file and incorporate those dependencies automatically, without me having to run generate-xcodeproj again.  If you know a way to deal with the git/local dependency issue as well, that would be great!!",Better way of working with Swift Package Manager (SPM)?

I have to use Swift for a simple programming course at my University.  
Now I have been programming for a couple of years main language being Java, since that's what I started on.  
I enjoy programming, do most of it in my spare time, watching videos reading books. But lately i have been struggling with **swift**.   

But before I get hated for being a complete *noob* at **swift** I have tried to many avenues.
Apple documentation,  [Lynda](https://Lynda.com), some free tutorials on YouTube. And of course my uni lectures and labs (least helpful).  

I just wanted some advice on how you helped to program better at swift, I have fallen behind in my labs wasted a whole day trying to do basic task's 
such as moving from one View to another inside a storyboard and basic enumerations and delegates or whatever.  
I'm not a very *click here to do this* kind of person, I enjoy typing up program so I can follow how it works, but Xcode loves to base everything of its UI. 

This a half Rant, half asking for advice on what helped you learn the basics.  
(I understand variables loops and data structures, I just can't seem to work with swift)  


Thank you for listening. 

",Why am I so bad at Swift? HALP!
777,883,2018-05-07 15:59:44,53,114,"(Warning: This is going to be a bit of a rant)

In my new job, I have to work on a backend written in Swift. So far, I like a lot about the language; it incorporates a lot of good and modern practices and is very type safe, yet at the same time it's also easy to understand for beginners.

However, it's really bothering me how bad the tooling is.
Here are some examples:
- There is a two-year old [compiler bug](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-631) about extensions in different files not being able to see each other. That bug has a lot of upvotes and 16 duplicates. There doesn't seem to be any indication that this is being worked on. What's worrisome here is not so much that it's not possible to do this at all - although that would be really helpful for namespacing etc. - but rather, that the appearance of this bug seems to be completely dependent on the compilation order, so you might never run into it, structure your code into namespaces and suddenly everything breaks without apparent reason.
- SPM and XCode don't really work well together
- The REPL is very limited
- Playgrounds crash all the time
- SPM and the REPL don't really work together and apparently [this isn't a priority right now](https://forums.swift.org/t/repl-and-swift-package-manager/7961). This means that currently, if I want to play around with a particular library, I have to create an extra executable project for it (needless to say, playgrounds also don't work with SPM).
- Being able to run tests on Linux requires maintaining a LinuxMain.swift file. Since it's not feasible to do this by hand after a certain point, one has to resort to [code generation](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/blob/master/guides/LinuxMain.md), and if one wants this to happen automatically one has to introduce git hooks into the team etc., all things which generate significant overhead.
- One solution could be to use alternative test frameworks, like Quick, but these in turn [don't seem to work well with XCode](https://github.com/Quick/Quick/issues/745).
- Speaking of tests, running tests from the console is no pleasant experience. There is no colour, test failures are not summarised at the bottom, etc. By contrast, RSpec (for Ruby) has top-notch (and configurable) test reporting.

And I probably am forgetting at least 20 other things that have bothered me in the past couple of weeks.

It seems like a shame to me - and also somewhat weird - that the community seems to be discussing so many ways in which the language could be improved in terms of features / APIs, yet all these important things are not being worked on. To me, this looks a lot like bike shedding.

Maybe I'm just expecting too much: Swift was built for iOS development, so it's maybe my company's fault to pick this technology. But frameworks like Vapor, Kitura etc. seem to have enough traction, so surely I can't be the only person running into these issues?
I would find it ok to say that ""the language is still young, give it time"", but many of these issues seem to have been known for quite a while and there is no resolution yet.",Is the Swift community ignoring the big problems with the tooling?

At my company, our very big app is (sadly) still on Swift 2.3

This causes multiple issues, one of them being that we cant use xcode 9, and therefore test on actual physical devices with iOS 10.

In a last ditch effort to try and convince the company to hurry up, I'm trying to build a list of reasons as to why we should do a project pause to migrate our code.

Here are some questions:

1. Apple mentionned recently that all iOS apps need to be Super Retina compliant and developed using the iOS 11 SDK. What does that entail exactly? Is an app made with swift 2.3 on xCode 8 ""Super retina compliant"", or is the migration to swift 4 mandatory for that new requirement?

2. Is there an actual way to test on a physical iPhone X since their minimum OS is 10, with an app in Swift 2.3? 

We already mentioned most of the technical issues related to not migrating already, and I just want to make sure I'm not spewing nonsense when discussing.

I'd like to learn to develop apple apps using swift, but I don't have a mac.  I also don't have a lot of money, so I'm thinking a used mac.  Every couple years they update the OS and the updates will only reach so far back... so how far back will function for my purposes? For example, there's a 2010 mac mini that someone was using as a server locally on kijiji.  


Background:  
I've been learning programming in my spare time through edX courses, starting with Intro to programming using Python, then I took CS50x \(C, more python, brief intro to web languages\), I did a website in python with the flask framework as my final project.    


I'm staying at home with 4 kids so it'll be awhile before I can get an office job no matter how good I get at programming, so I've been considering app development due to the potential continued income stream from a successful app compared to one time payout per website built.

I just had a conversation with a colleague that came down to the question ""why should I even use optional chaining or safe unwrapping?"". I was baffled and couldn't really answer that, even though I've been using these concepts daily for almost 2 years now (and have enough background in developing in other languages).

His code contains a lot of statements that look like this:

    class Foo {
        var num: Int?
        func addOne() -&gt; Int {
            return num! + 1
        }

When I asked him for a reason to use the force unwrapping, he replied: ""why not, I know for certain that the value is going to be set at this point"". He also uses a lot of ""if var != nil"" statements that I consider ""non-swifty"". All this lead to statements that look like

    if(!(optionalClass!.anOptionalBool!)) { ... }

Are there any more pros (or cons) for using safe unwrapping/optional chaining instead of plain checking for nil besides aesthetics? Is memory management a factor when I use ""if let"" unwrapping to make variables only available in the following block?","More reasons to safely unwrap optionals than ""good-looking""/Swift-like code?"

817,925,2018-06-06 21:11:55,10,120,"Hey r/swift, happy WWDC week!

My name’s Caleb, and I’m an educator and app developer. I started out teaching Jr. High tech and career classes, learned to code, taught iOS development for a few years, and wound up as a Sr. Instructional Designer at Apple, helping build the ""Everyone Can Code” program that’s helped tens of thousands of students in High Schools and Colleges learn to build apps.
Now I work at Lambda School, and we’re putting on a free (yes, completely 100% free), livestreamed iOS mini code bootcamp. We’ll cover the fundamentals of programming with Swift, get you building your first simple apps, show you how to build user interfaces using Storyboards, and get your own iOS apps running on your own devices.

The class runs Monday through Thursday, June 11th - June 21st. Live lectures begin at 5:00 p.m. Pacific (8:00 Eastern), and if you can’t attend live we’ll make the archives available immediately after the recording.

It covers:

* The basics of Xcode, how it works, and how to use it to create apps.
* Introduction to Swift: the programming language used to create macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS apps. 
* UIKit Basics: designing user interfaces without any code. 

No, you won’t be able to get a job after it, and we’re not giving out certificates because no one actually cares if you took a free class. But you will learn fundamental skills that'll set you up to continue learning independently, or in one of our full-time classes, if you want.

You can register for the class, we’re calling it iOS Development 101, [here](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/cs/ios/101).

And because I recognize this is reddit, yes, the instructors of this course are paid employees of Lambda School (our lead instructor, /u/mduser63, has worked on popular DJ software and has been building iOS apps since day one), and yes, Lambda School hopes that you will learn about it and enroll in the full free-until-hired 7-month iOS program as a result, but I promise this is a real class, not a giant sales pitch; we’d just rather create something that’s valuable instead of dumping a bunch of money into Facebook ads.

(It also happens that focusing on teaching people who actually want to learn to program results in awesome students who do really well at Lambda School and get jobs quickly. So running these courses helps people find out if this is for them, and if they're the right fit for a longer, full-time program like ours.)","Hey r/swift, I used to be a Sr. Instructional Designer at Apple, and I’m helping put on a free, livestreamed intro to iOS class"

I have an app I am working with using swift 4 for iOS development. I have added the twilio framework for video chat and firebase for user authorization and database functionality. I am able to setup a test chat between 2 users but, where I am having an issue is automated process of setting up a room, retrieving a token from my setup server, and sending an invite to a user to join the conference.
To be more specific the app is setup to use Firebase user authentication, when a user wants to join a video chat they click on a button and are directed to a view controller where ""friends"" of the user are listed, when a user selects a friend they click a button to start a chat, the app creates an entry in firebase to create a database entry for the chat which creates a numeric hash value of the usernames to generate a name for the chat room in the back end and forwards the user to the video chat controller.
Where I am stuck is how/what to write in swift code to send the room name to the token server, retrieve the token, send the token to the original users video controller, send an in app alert to the invited user, with a clickable link the invited user joins the conference, and create an entry in the database once the conference is started. Does anyone have a more detailed tutorial they can link me to so I can figure this out or maybe a completed app on Git (not twilios) so maybe I can see what I am missing?

This is what facebook setting page looks like: 

https://gfycat.com/SizzlingSorrowfulGrayfox

I have started a new project, using only 1 tableview, with style grouped, sections and with header.

I want to round each sections of the tableview. I have to round the top left and top right of the header (top part of the section), and bottom left and bottom right of the last cell (bottom part of the section).

I have done the top part, using below code in HeaderTableViewCell: 

        let rectShape = CAShapeLayer()
        rectShape.bounds = self.frame
        rectShape.position = self.center
        rectShape.path = UIBezierPath(roundedRect: self.bounds, byRoundingCorners: [.topLeft , .topRight], cornerRadii: CGSize(width: 10, height: 10)).cgPath
        self.layer.mask = rectShape

However when I do the same for the last cell, weird thing happen. 

https://gfycat.com/UnselfishCommonFlee

When the page first loaded, the corners are correctly rounded, but however when I scroll down, and up, the second last cell got rounded.

This is my code to round the last cell in cellForRowAt: 

        if indexPath.row + 1 == childArray?.count { //last cell, set corner radius

            print(""is last cell"")
            let rectShape = CAShapeLayer()
            rectShape.bounds = rowDataCell.frame
            rectShape.position = rowDataCell.center
            rectShape.path = UIBezierPath(roundedRect: rowDataCell.bounds, byRoundingCorners: [.bottomLeft , .bottomRight], cornerRadii: CGSize(width: 10, height: 10)).cgPath
            rowDataCell.layer.mask = rectShape

(2) I want to make a nicer landscape view. I know I will have to redefine somethings (possibly flip the axis of my containerStackView). Is there a cleaner way of doing this kind of thing I am not aware of?

(3) Larger question: I plan on continuing to make all my views programmatically. Is this a fool's errand? I know the basics of Storyboarding and, when pressed, can make apps. However, it really feels like I am pulling teeth trying to get all the StackViews to line up, the lag time of loading the Storyboard itself (running an older machine), and there is **ALWAYS** a constraint I am missing or changed without me touch it.

But Cocoa Touch as a Framework confuses me... it's not something I import as a module like UIKit, so my question is what exactly is it? When I load up XCode what is Cocoa Touch actually doing? Is Cocoa a framework too?

Match users based off common interests or friends

Send/receive messages

2) install cocoapods and install the library

3) link up buttons/viewcontrollers.

4) copy code and edit code

5) make it so their information is saved so you can do calling to the database for future use

I understand the first two concepts very straight forward. The third one I just need to learn more about. The fourth and fifth ones are the problem. Basic lessons have very basic concepts but when I look at the code being used for sign in and sign up they use methods and syntax I've never seen. How do I learn to make the jump???

What I noticed a lot of people saying was that python was a great language to begin with because it’s simple, however a lot of other were saying it’s best to go to something like java or C++ since it has a lot more uses etc even though it is a lot harder.

872,1811,2018-07-16 22:10:16,9,1,"Say you've got several optional values in your code:

    import Foundation
    
    var optionalValueX:Int? = 2
    var optionalValueY:Int? = 3
    var optionalValueZ:Int? = 4
    var optionalValueA:Int? = 5
    

Now you have to unwrap them before you can use them. I've initialized the optionals here just in case you're cutting and pasting this somewhere to play with.

Many examples on the net lead you to believe this the way you should do it:

    if let x = optionalValueX {
       if let y = optionalValueY {
          if let z = optionalValueZ {
             if let a = optionalValueA {
                 print(x+y+z+a)
             }
          }
       }
    }

However, your code is getting rather pointy. This is sometimes called the pyramid of doom or Christmas tree code. Keeping up with all the closing braces can be a pain, and you quickly loose real estate to code in. I find Swift to be very verbose, and you'll end up splitting most of your lines of code if you get out too far. 

Today, I learned you can actually accomplish the same thing with one ""if"" statement using Optional Chaining.

        if let x = optionalValueX,
           let y = optionalValueY,
           let z = optionalValueZ,
           let a = optionalValueA {
            print(x + y + z + a)
        }
        else {
             print(""Not all optional values are set"")
        }
    

Separate each let with a comma. See the Swift Docs below for more info. This little gem is documented, but not really spelled out. See if you can find the one example in the docs.

I see in that sea of data one significant value that makes me think I captured a ""kneel/sit"" action, which is `-2.08528087712935e-05`. 

If a user is standing and then sits/kneels I assume I could look for such extreme value changes in the Y axis. What happens if the user starts the app while sitting and then kneels, though for example? Is my initial rough approach sound at detecting these sorts of motion events?

Any feedback/guidance is appreciated!

I want to create a Mac OS app for real-time communication. Is essentially a video player, but I want to use another Mac to control the play back remotely.

On the web I would use socket io.

941,1884,2018-08-26 06:50:25,8,1,"I'm new to swift (ruby/elixir/golang background) and have a question about a generic way to create game achievements. In my game, if an achievement is unlocked then they player receives access to more content.  What I want is generic way to structure achievements in swift so that they'd be easy to maintain and add -- and I'm just not clear on what tools to use (enum, struct, class, etc.). 

Each achievement would have:  


\`\`\`  
{  
title: (string),  
description: (string),  
unique\_id: (string or int or something),  
condition: (method),  
}

\`\`\`  


Where \*condition\* is a function that evaluates to true if they've accomplished the achievement, otherwise false. I'd store whether or not they'd already accomplished the achievement by storing the achievement's unique id in UserDefaults (or something).    

Achievements could be reached by:   
\* the number of plays  
\* how well they play the came (I'm tracking their taps per round)  
\* their all-time interaction (I'm tracking their all-time taps)  
\* etc.  

I'm open to suggestions, but my initial thought was to have an array of ""achievements"", which could be an array of structs where I pass in a _title, description, unique_id, and a condition method_. However, from what I've read about structs it seems like I can't pass in a method. 

Ideally, I could parse through achievements like:

```
let achievements = [...]
for achievement in achievements {
   if(achievement.condition()) {
     // record that it's been unlocked if it hasn't been already
   }
}
```

Any suggestions? The thought of creating a base achievement class has crossed my mind, then a bunch of small classes that inherit base and implement a required condition method. Just feels like a stupid way to do it.

Afterwards create an Array of the object entry, where I can append and remove specific entries. I'm not sure if it matters but I have not tried to create storyboards programatically.

1. How would I create a label and text field when I press the + button?  

2. What kind of UI element would I need to make this happen? Horizontal stack view? I have not fiddled around with Table views yet, but I'd be willing to know more if that is the right tool

I don't use a playground or any kind of a visual editor. No storyboards no .sks files. Nothing visual.

It is all manually programmed in. Everything is spaced on the screen in the Gamescene.swift file.

I do all the universal programming by hand via a formula.

So I have a blank screen that I hand fill in programatically with all the locations.

Though this may seem counter-intuitive and quite frankly asinine to program this way in 2018, it works amazingly 'smooth'

Zero problems.

And once the initial location of all the objects is perfected on the screen, I am finding this code to be a joy to use.

    protocol DatabaseService {
      func getUsers()-&gt; [User]
    }

    class CoreDataService: DatabaseService {
      // ...
    }


In your view controller, you pretend that the class doesn't exist, and just use an instance of that protocol.

    let databaseService: DatabaseService = CoreDataService()

So in that last line, you have a constant called databaseService of type DatabaseService and it's set equal to CoreDataService

So DatabaseService is the name of the protocol and it's used in the class CoreDataService.

Then the line:

    let databaseService: DatabaseService = CoreDataService()

is saying the constant databaseService is of type DatabaseService (which is a protocol) and is set equal to CoreDataService but CoreDataService inherits from DatabaseService.

So a protocol can be a type and CoreDataService inherits from DatabaseService and DatabaseService is being set equal to CoreDataService.

Isn't that circular?

That also sound confusing as heck.


&gt;To change to Realm, all you need to do is make a new class that conforms to the same protocol. Because you didn't rely on a specific implementation, you don't need to change code in your view controller. It's a huge time saver!

I have to code this Quiz App for a school project of mine having only less than a week left and before I continue with doing so there are a couple questions I have.

The app will contain around 200 questions, while some of them include images.

As each question has around 3-6 it would be kind of inefficient to copy &amp; paste / hardcode them into the app (same goes for the question itself). Currently they are in an .numbers file with the question in column A; the correct answer in column B; 2-5 incorrect, misleading answer in columns C-G.

As copy&amp;pasting 1000 times isn’t an option I think, how exactly would I be able to import the .numbers file into the app?

I plan to include simple functions like keeping count of whether the question has been answered correctly/incorrectly in the user’s session and to have it get shown again if it has been answered incorrectly. Also I’d love to be able to keep track of how much time a user takes before settling for an answer. 

As I don’t have much time before I have to be done I’d really appreciate it if you could provide me with the most easy&amp;quick-to-learn solution for someone who only knows the pure basics of swift and html (I’m on OSX using Xcode)

Also I would like to add that I will have to make the same app for Android and would find it pretty neat if the „database“-solution worked for that, too. I have heard about „Realm mobile database“. Would you recommend that for this project?

If yes, then I’d really appreciate if someone could help me out on how I should get started and what I should google regarding Realms exactly. Even though I do know a little bit of coding, I find it very hard to understand the language used in the Realm documentation.

And my final question: what would be the easiest way to have the data/statistics such as how long the app was used in total etc. sent to me? The users (around 30 in total) are going to get 1 week to use it, considering that I don’t have an Apple Developer account/subscription.

Thank you very much in advance!

978,984,2018-09-16 01:06:53,5,9,"Hello!

I'm very new to Swift, currently working on building my first app, and I've been encountering a very odd error that I wasn't able to find information about on SO, here, or any of the other programming subreddits, so I figured I'd make a post and see if I could get some help.

[Here's a basic screenshot of my app. It's essentially a collaborative checklist](https://imgur.com/mj9dVbF). It keeps a list of tasks, and whether or not they've been completed. This list is displayed to the user in a column, with each item being green or red, depending on whether it's been marked as completed. The user can tap on tasks to mark them as complete (or unmark them), or swipe them left to delete them from the list. At the bottom, there are two buttons. The first lets the user add an item to the list. The second refreshes the list based on data from a server, to reflect the other people's changes to the list. This refresh is also done every time the user marks a task, deletes a task, or adds a task, and it sends each of those marks to the server as well, each time the action is performed.

Anyway, the initial problem I had with this: The UI would not update unless something else is tapped or pressed. The data is fully up-to-date at all times, and the buttons will ACT properly based on that up-to-date data, but it will not show as such in the UI. My first thought was that it wasn't running on the main thread, but I have spent many hours in the debugger confirming that, yes, it is running on the main thread every time it runs the UI update.

In an effort to combat this, I posted to /r/iOSProgramming ([Thread found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/9f1a4z/ui_not_updating_already_running_on_main_thread/)). The advice I got, while incredibly kind and helpful, did not solve my problem; it did, however, push me to replace the StackView I had been using with a CollectionView - something I should have done from the start, but I didn't know to do. After refactoring my code, I found... No change. After playing with it for a while, though, I did find something that... Kinda worked. If, rather than doing the UI changes outright, I animated it, it would end with the right data! However, the animation is definitely a little... Off.

The animation, as I understand it, should go from the color it was, to the color it needs to be, if it needs to change at all. Oddly, though, it ends up animating a fade from the color of *some other task* to what it needs to be. That is, it may immediately flash to the color it should be, or it may work properly. That's not too big a deal, except that this ""fade from some other button's color"" also happens to EVERY button on EVERY update, meaning that a task may be green, flash to red, then slowly fade back to green, constantly, which is... Incredibly annoying.

[Here's a screenshot of the app before tapping task 7](https://imgur.com/mj9dVbF)

[Here's a screenshot of immediately after - 6 flashed green and started fading back to red, and eleven flashed red and started fading back to green.](https://imgur.com/UJKCzfH)

Simply lowering the animation time to be shorter is not an acceptable workaround, as that simply puts the issue back to the initial issue of the UI not updating, and after fighting the original issue for long enough, I have no other ideas as to what could possibly be wrong.

[Rather than dumping all of the code here, here's my GitHub repo for this project.](https://github.com/2CATteam/UniteiOS)

[Here's the cell class](https://github.com/2CATteam/UniteiOS/blob/master/Unite%20Client/CollectionViewCell.swift)

[Here's the main view controller](https://github.com/2CATteam/UniteiOS/blob/master/Unite%20Client/ViewController.swift)

I'm certainly an absolute beginner, so I would expect that the problem is something silly that I've missed (My hardware is awful, I suppose it could be due to the simulator's lag? I have no other Mac or a physical iPhone available for testing), but at this point, I'd just be thrilled to have any sort of progress. I would greatly appreciate any help with this problem.",Color transition animation does not start with the right color

980,982,2018-09-18 14:17:38,4,9,"Here is the release announcement for Swift 4.2, along with some highlights:

##[Swift 4.2 Released!](https://swift.org/blog/swift-4-2-released/)

###**Generics improvements**

With the completion of conditional conformance support, Swift 4.2 makes significant progress in implementing the vision of generics in the language. Better support for generics ultimately reduces the amount of boilerplate needed in your code and make more of your code reusable. To learn more about conditional conformance, see more at:

- [SE-0143 Conditional conformances](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0143-conditional-conformances.md)

Watch the [Swift Generics](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/406/) WWDC 2018 presentation for more details.

###**Standard Library updates**

The standard library in Swift 4.2 includes a number of new features, including improvements to the Hashable protocol as well as a new unified set of randomization functions and protocols.

See more at:

- [SE-0197 Adding in-place removeAll(where:) to the Standard Library](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0197-remove-where.md)
- [SE-0199 Adding toggle to Bool](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0199-bool-toggle.md)
- [SE-0202 Random Unification](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0202-random-unification.md)
- [SE-0204 Add last(where:) and lastIndex(where:) Methods](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0204-add-last-methods.md)
- [SE-0206 Hashable Enhancements](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0206-hashable-enhancements.md)
- [SE-0207 Add an allSatisfy algorithm to Sequence](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0207-containsOnly.md)

###**Binary compatibility**

Swift 4.2 brings the language closer towards a stabilized ABI, enabling binary compatibility for future releases of Swift. Visit the ABI Dashboard for more details on the current progress of this effort.

###**Additional language and compiler updates**

Swift 4.2 includes a number of improvements that have a noticable impact on developer experience, including:

- Support for batch mode compilation resulting in faster build times
- Change in calling convention for retain/release cycle to reduce code size and improve runtime performance
- Lazier SIL deserialization with -Onone
- Recursive metadata support
- More compact reflection metadata
- Default arguments are inlined at call sites
- Some long-standing bug fixes, including init declname, switch with multiple case labels per block, inheritance of generic initializers, and more
- Swift 4.2 also implements the following language proposals from the Swift Evolution process:

- [SE-0054 Abolish ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional type](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0054-abolish-iuo.md). Read even more details about the reimplementation [here](https://swift.org/blog/iuo/).
- [SE-0079 Allow using optional binding to upgrade self from a weak to strong reference](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0079-upgrade-self-from-weak-to-strong.md)
- [SE-0193 Cross-module inlining and specialization](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0193-cross-module-inlining-and-specialization.md)

- [SE-0212 Compiler Version Directive](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0212-compiler-version-directive.md)

###**Package Manager Updates**

Swift 4.2 introduces new features for the Swift Package Manager:

- Support for batch mode. Swift targets will be now compiled using the Swift compiler’s batch mode.
- Improved scheme generation logic. The scheme generation logic is improved and generates schemes as follows:
  - One scheme containing all regular and test targets of the root package.
  - One scheme per executable target containing the test targets whose dependencies intersect with the dependencies of the executable target.
- Automatic Xcode project generation. The generate-xcodeproj has a new –watch option to watch the file system and automatically regenerate the Xcode project if needed. This uses the watchman tool to watch the required files.

Swift 4.2 also implements the following Package Manager proposals from the Swift Evolution process:

- [SE-0201 Package Manager Local Dependencies](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0201-package-manager-local-dependencies.md). SwiftPM now supports declaring dependency on a package using its path on disk instead of the git URL. This requires updating the package’s tools version to 4.2.
- [SE-0208 Package Manager System Library Targets](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0208-package-manager-system-library-targets.md). The PackageDescription API in tools version 4.2 supports a new type of target “system library target”, which moves the current system-module packages feature from package to target level.
- [SE-0209 Package Manager Swift Language Version API Update](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0209-package-manager-swift-lang-version-update.md). swiftLanguageVersions property in PackageDescription manifest API for tools version 4.2 is changed from an array of Integers to an array of SwiftVersion enum.

I am working on a framework feature that will allow to dehydrate and rehydrate `Codable` structs to store them on Disk.

My current research points that you can't instantiate a dynamic Type as we used to do with NSClassFromString (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37318897/is-it-possible-to-obtain-a-swift-type-from-a-string)

As the above post suggests I am trying to create a Type Registry, but when pulling the Type from the map the compiler can't determinate the correct type... 

Take a look on the playground code below and let me know if you can imagine any possible workaround:

```swift
//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play

import Cocoa

struct Info:Codable{
    var foo:String
}

func encode&lt;T:Codable&gt;(_ object:T.Type) -&gt; [String: Any] {
    //dummie
    return [:]
}

//This works as expected
encode(Info.self)

//Now lets put the type in a map
var map:[String:Codable.Type] = [:]
map[""info""] = Info.self
let aType = map[""info""]!

//the type from the map is equal to the static type
print(""aType == Info.self is \(aType.self == Info.self)"")

//But the below line won't compile
//encode(aType.self)

```

However, of all the interview-esque buzzwords I've heard and made it a point to understand, *closures* were always a bit fuzzy. I understood them, at least I thought I did, but if you asked me point blank to define what a closure is, I'd likely glaze over for a few seconds before pulling some sort of attempt at an answer out of my ass. 

Anyways, I just read [this article](https://www.andrewcbancroft.com/2017/06/05/why-is-it-called-a-closure-anyway-a-swift-conceptual-look/) discussing the barebones concept of what a closure is, and why it's important in functional programming, and it clicked for me. It's a fairly quick read. The article is written in a Swift context, but I believe the principle of closures is a transient one across all programming languages.

        Allocator
        
        Passive allocation investment tool. It departs from three assumptions:
          1. the age when one wants to stop investing (should take life expectancy
            in your country into consideration);
          2. the user risk profile;
          3. that assets are grouped in three pools.
          3.1. the emergency fund, corresponds to expenses for six months (think six
            months of unemployment),
          3.2. the second pool corresponds to low risk investments
          3.3. the third pool are the high risk investments.
        
          Try to vary the types of investment within each pool, this tool will not handle
          investments within pool, only the total pool value. Decision on what is low
          and high risk, as well as decision on the risk profile is entirely on users
          discretion. Every year, the tool will help the user allocate the correct
          amount in each of the pools, based in a simple algorithm. Finally, since
          sometimes one needs to quickly record a deposit into one of the investments
          , there is a quick-add add command, in which one can add the latest
          low risk and high risk investment without going trough all the questions.

I've been google-diving for hours and have run into wrong answers (""you can't""), outdated tutorials that do not work in the current version of swift and in one case, a question asked in 2018 that was marked as ""already answered"" with a link to an outdated method from 2015 that no longer works.

Is there a way to go about this in the modern (2018) version of swift?",How do you call swift functions from objectiveC++ or C++?
991,438,2018-10-02 19:03:32,3,1,"Thanks to some users on this forum, I found that this specific issue is causing my other issue here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/9kk1eb/how_do_you_call_swift_functions_from_objectivec/

Basically, I'm trying to call Swift from an objective c++, and objective c++ from swift.

When including MyProjectName-Swift.h in my .mm file (which is needed to call my swift functions from c++) , building produces errors inside the auto-generated .h file. For example:

Cannot find protocol declaration for 'UIApplicationDelegate', superclass of 'AppDelegate'

Cannot find interface declaration for 'UIResponder', superclass of 'AppDelegate'

Cannot find interface declaration for 'UIViewController', superclass of 'ViewController'

No type or protocol named 'AKToggleable'


With the exception of UIViewContoller, all of the errors are on components from a framework I'm using called AudioKit. I'm building it from the source as I've added some custom audio processing nodes. I've had no problems with AudioKit like this until I added ""Include MyProgram-Swift.h"" to that .mm file it's needed in.

I've ran into some similar issues on StackOverflow, with people having issues when using a framework and attempting to move data from c++ -&gt; swift and swift -&gt; c++, but none are exactly the same, but it seems this may be a swift bug based on the other mentions. I haven't seen any useful fixes posted on any of them. However, the earliest I saw this reported was in 2015 - which isn't encouraging.

I'm a bit at a dead end on this one, so anyone with even the vaguest notion of where to look or suggestion would be a tremendous help. I've resorted to tweaking around random settings, clean, build over and over - and with 914 source files - it's a slow process.",Errors in Objective-C Generated Interface Header

As I said - i haven't touched this code for a few weeks and I've no idea why xcode has decided that AKMicrophone isn't an AKNode now. I've been wrestling with issues related to sending data from swift-&gt;obj-c++ and obj-c++ -&gt; swift - and have had to juggle around header imports because of issues with the swift header interfering with the framework, but I don't understand why this would mess up this particular segment of code.

995,2878,2018-10-09 02:58:10,2,1,"I am just following along and I know the apple api way of parsing the data, which is normally the way everyone else does it.

&amp;#x200B;

I post into many JSON prettifyers to make sure my eyes aren't misreading the tabs, but it seems that they are picking up errors too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so to get to the point, I am trying to parse the messages and it just pulls nil EVERY time. It would be fine if it was like once or twice, but it does it every time  so something is. definitely going wrong here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what the console output is looking like

&amp;#x200B;

    commitJson(sha: ""3665294d1e813d35594d6bcdc0a61983caa6e0cd"", message: nil, url: ""https://api.github.com/repos/apple/swift/commits/3665294d1e813d35594d6bcdc0a61983caa6e0cd"", commit: GitHubCommits.commit(author: GitHubCommits.author(date: Optional(""2018-10-03T19:12:15Z""), name: ""Karoy Lorentey"")))

It is pulling everything, but the message and stack overflow hasn't really helped me at all. I might be missing something, but I think it's better if I let my code talk. Sorry for the struct layout...... Either ways I am going to document this on stack overflow right away if this gets solved.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the struct with the json

    struct author : Codable{
        var date: String
        var name: String
    }
    struct commit : Codable {
        var author: author
    }
    struct commitJson : Codable {
        var sha: String
        var message: String?
        var url: String
        
        var commit: commit
    }

seems solid right? I need the optional or the thing will crash on me....

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the parsing

     guard let url = URL(string: ""https://api.github.com/repos/apple/swift/commits?per_page=100"") else {return}
    
            URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, statusCode, error) in
                
                //print(statusCode)
                if let error = error{
                    print(""error : \(error)"")
                    return
                }
                guard let data = data else {return}

                    let decoder = JSONDecoder()

                }
            }.resume()

I feel like I am not doing anything wrong, but I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.  I tried converting the thing into a string and switching the some stuff like the quotes then back into a data object, but I either got it wrong or it doesn't help at all.

Anyway...

I'm implementing pagination/infinite scrolling into a small news reader app I'm making as a practice project. I looked up a good guide and everything is working so far but I'm having trouble applying it correctly here.

I'm fetching the data like so:

    enum FetchResult&lt;T&gt; {
        case success(T), failure(Error)
    }
    
    func fetchData&lt;T: Decodable&gt;(url: URL, completion: @escaping (FetchResult&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Void) {
        
        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
            guard let data = data else {completion(.failure(error!)); return }
            do {
                let object = try JSONDecoder().decode(T.self, from: data)
                completion(.success(object))
            } catch {
                completion(.failure(error))
            }
        }.resume()
    }

And call it in my table view controller's `viewDidLoad`. The data is then added into my `storyData` array (at this point ALL the results are put into the array, I think I need to only gran the first 15 or so):

        fetchData(url: jsonUrl) { (result : FetchResult&lt;TopStoriesResponse&gt;) in
            switch result {
            case .success(let object): self.storyData = object.results
            case .failure(let error): print(error)
            }
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                self.tableView.reloadData()
            }
        }

And then to handle the infinite scroll/pagination:

    var fetchingMore = false
    
    override func scrollViewDidScroll(_ scrollView: UIScrollView) {
        let offsetY = scrollView.contentOffset.y
        let contentHeight = scrollView.contentSize.height
        
        if offsetY &gt; contentHeight - scrollView.frame.height {
            if !fetchingMore {
                fetchMoreStories()
            }
        }
    }
    
    func fetchMoreStories() {
        fetchingMore = true

        // Fetch more stories
        fetchData(url: jsonUrl) { (result : FetchResult&lt;TopStoriesResponse&gt;) in
            switch result {
            case .success(let object): self.storyData = object.results
            case .failure(let error): print(error)
            }
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                self.tableView.reloadData()
            }
        }
    }

I think what I'm trying to do is on the first `fetchData` call, populate the `storyData` array with, say 15 stories. Then, when the `fetchingMore` flag is set to true in `fetchMoreStories` once it detects the user has reached the bottom, call `fetchData` again but this time append the *next* 15 stories.

These are my tableview methods:

    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -&gt; Int {
        if section == 0 {
            return storyData.count
        } else if section == 1 &amp;&amp; fetchingMore {
            return 1
        }
        return 0
    }
    
    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UITableViewCell {
        if indexPath.section == 0 {
            let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: ""storyCell"", for: indexPath) as! StoryTableViewCell
            
            let stories = storyData[indexPath.row]
            
            cell.headlineLabel.text = stories.title
            cell.abstractLabel.text = stories.abstract
            
            if let url = stories.multimedia.first?.url {
                cell.storyImage.cacheImage(urlString: url)
            }
            
            return cell
        } else {
            let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: ""loadingCell"", for: indexPath) as! LoadingCell
            cell.spinner.startAnimating()

            return cell
        }

    }

It's very easy to create an article on some of the popular websites that looks professional until you dig in deeper and realize that the author has no business teaching anyone how to program. Or, at the very least, needs some copy editing and code review assistance to improve the quality of their article.

Unfortunately, there is very little overview of these types of posts and new programmers could be easily duped into adopting these bad practices, teaching them antipatterns and making their learning process unnecessarily difficult, leading to very buggy programs and lots of frustration. I believe we, as a community, should work to change this situation.

To that end I propose some policy changes for r/swift:

1. Write some rules and FAQ entries which outline some simple guidelines to posting content.

1. Add a way to report misinformation. That way people can report articles that are poorly-written or misleading and moderation can deal with them.

1. Cultivate a team of reviewers. Refer reported misinformation posts to them and have them review it and see if they should be approved or denied.

1. Possibly set up auto moderation on posting links and the like so that tutorials can be reviewed before being posted to the sub.

1. Possibly allow people to bypass the auto moderation if they've shown they have posted good information in the past. This level of trust could be granted or removed on a case-by-case basis.

I found this [Swift Automator Action Xcode Template](https://macosxautomation.com/automator/xcode-swift-template/index.html) but it doesn't work. I can compile the action and add it to Automator's library of actions. However, when I try to add the action to a workflow I get ""The action MyAction could not be loaded because its executable is not loadable. Try reinstalling the action.""

If I run Automator from the command line I get a more specific error message at the moment I drag it onto the workflow: ""dyld: warning, LC_RPATH @executable_path/../Frameworks in /Users/joshua/Library/Automator/SwiftAction2.action/Contents/MacOS/SwiftAction2 being ignored in restricted program because of @executable_path"".

The only dynamic libraries it's loading from it's bundle are the various ""libswiftCore*.dylib"". Swift bundles this into each executable target it makes. Automator will not allow dynamic libraries to be loaded from an ""@executable_path""; some kind of security restriction.

And that's where I'm stuck.

I'm thinking that come when Swift 5.0 drops with ABI stability then the next OS X release will have Swift in it's /System/ folder. Once there the action bundle will no longer try to load the Swift dynamic libraries from an ""@executable_path"" and it will work.

2. structs
3. protocols

It turns out concatenation is much faster, even if you have to use String(&lt;variable&gt;) to get the variable to a string. Here are my results:

**Time elapsed for concat test with 1,000,000 strings: 0.09702706336975098 s.**

**Time elapsed for escaping with 1,000,000 strings: 0.20748794078826904 s.**

Now both operations are so fast in most applications it would never matter which option you use, however I would recommend escaping because it is easier to read. However in large data processing applications it is clear that concatenation is about 20 times faster than escaping.

These tests where run on the main thread of a UIKit application on an iPhone XS. I switched their execution order and there was no meaningful difference in execution times. I ran this on the main thread to ensure any background process would not interfere with execution time. To further ensure this was the case I closed all applications, rebooted the phone and waited 5 minutes before executing any tests. The phone was also in airplane mode with bluetooth off to further remove any interference. The phone was fully charged and plugged into my mac for debugging. **Edit: this is swift 4.2, iPhone XS iOS 12.1(16B92)**

I don’t know how to code. Am planning to learn swift and develop apps on iOS. I don’t know any programming language but know logic.

Have created mini apps with Shortcuts App to maintain my workers salary &amp; attendance.

Am an civil engineer. But I got chooses by an IT based MNC and worked there for few months before quitting and getting back to my core field. Even there they were saying something like high level diagram, low level diagram. 

So,

`let theArray: [Int?] = [0, 1, nil, 3, 4, 5, nil, nil, 7]`

I need to do three things with it:

* Treat it as a circular array; that is, iterate over it such that when the end is reached, the iterator goes back to the beginning of the array.
* Iterate in reverse, that is, a call to \`next()\` takes you to the previous element in the array, and when you reach the beginning, start over at the end
* Allow the nils to stay in the array, but skip over them when the program requires it

I've met the first two, but I can't seem to get at the last one, and I am sure it's because I'm weak with generics. If one of you generics gurus out there can help me, I'd really appreciate it.

Here's what I have. It's the forward iterator version. I want to call `compactNext()` to get the next non-nil value out of the array. Here's the problem: `compactNext()` doesn't seem to know that collection is a collection of optionals. When I unwrap the return from `next()`, I get exactly what I'd expect: optionals. But I can't unwrap them; the compiler says the type is wrong. But from outside the iterator, I can unwrap the values just fine. So it's something about my combination of types with optionals, but I don't know what. I'll put some example code at the bottom to show the problem. Thanks to anyone who can help.

    public struct LoopIterator&lt;Base: Collection&gt;: IteratorProtocol {
    
        private let collection: Base
        private var index: Base.Index
    
        public init(_ collection: Base) {
            self.collection = collection
            self.index = collection.startIndex
        }
    
        public mutating func compactNext() -&gt; Base.Element {
            repeat {
                switch next() {
                case let .some(compilerSaysNotOptional):
                    return compilerSaysNotOptional
                case .none:
                    print(""I have no hair left to pull out"")
                }
            } while true
        }
    
        public mutating func next() -&gt; Base.Element? {
            guard !collection.isEmpty else { return nil }
    
            defer {
                index = collection.index(after: index)
                if index == collection.endIndex { index = collection.startIndex }
            }
    
            return collection[index]
        }
    
    }

Here's the sample code: I've tried every combination of generic templates I can think of, but nothing lets me unwrap the optionals that come out of `next()`. As you can see, I can unwrap them here. But if I have to unwrap them after I get them, then the iterator is kind of wasted. I might as well write a three-line function to do the same thing. I thought it might be better to do it more ""swiftily"", I suppose. All I'm doing swiftly at the moment is getting a concussion from banging my head on the wall.

    let theArray: [Int?] = [0, 1, nil, 3, 4, 5, 6, nil, 8, 9]

```
When switching to the Swift 4 toolchain (and updating the Package manifest language comment) the code builds correctly. Building the targets directly in Xcode works fine even with the Swift 5 toolchain (however, this is not being built with the Package manifest).

The Package manifest appears as:
```
// swift-tools-version:5.0
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: ""MyProject"",
    products: [

    ]
)
```
If I remove the individual target from from the executable target list, I get the error: `product 'MyProject' doesn't reference any targets`.

I've started learning to code 8 months ago with freecodecamp, I've learned html,css,sass,jquery and some JavaScript ,3 months ago i started  a bootcamp in mobile dev, unsure on what i wanted to do.then i realized i hate java and swift and didn't want to get a job as a mobile [dev.](https://dev.so) so basically i wasted 3 months on a tech that i hate now.

during the bootcamp i did finish some very basic projects like a calculator , we were rushed to learn so many things in 3 months and basically for those apps i copied and pasted the code,mostly not understanding what i was doing. and i feel like a fraud .

after these experiences now i know i don't like JavaScript and I hate Java and Swift and the slow and pathetic android studio and xcode which i had to suffer these three months.

recently i was so sad on why i can't choose a programming language and stick to it, till i saw a video of this guy.

**·**   
**knowledge**   
**of software design, architecture and patterns**   


**·**   
**comfortable**   
**working extensively with version control systems like Git**   


But the problem is i don't know anything about **data structures and algorithms.they didn't teach that in bootcamp and i really want to apply for this internship.**

how can i do that even I'm a newbie in python and i have very noob projects in java and swift,which i didn't understand the building process and just copied and pasted the code.

I don't want to include those projects in my portfolio because i can't explain them if someone asks.

I make use of a couple of recursive enums, for example:

As you can see the case `multiple` is recursive and this works fine. Everything compiles and works as I expect.

I was reading through the [Swift documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Enumerations.html) and I came across the `indirect` keyword:

```
You indicate that an enumeration case is recursive by writing indirect before it, which tells the compiler to insert the necessary layer of indirection.
```

Which means that the definition above should be:
```
enum SortDescriptor&lt;T&gt; {
  case singular((T, T) -&gt; Bool, Bool)
  indirect case multiple([SortDescriptor&lt;T&gt;])

I’m not a developer or someone who know   swift or Xcode app development but what I wanted to ask is somehow interesting let me explain ...

After checking the apps functions I I realised that are many errors  and of course proved them that is not working 
( one of the error : it’s not showing a menu buton on different apple id’s or phones

1102,221,2019-01-05 18:52:11,3,1,"One of the common tasks an iOS developer needs to implement is a way to fetch an image from a web url and display it in a UIImageView. While this can be quickly accomplished with URLSession or using some 3rd party framework, it is fairly small amount of code to implement your own (more efficient than bare URLSession, lighter than 3rd party framework).

&amp;#x200B;

URLSessionConfiguration has a caching policy which you can set to only download the image if it is not already in the cache. One extra thing which needs to be done is handling multiple concurrent requests from the same image. This can be done by building a dictionary map of all requests, using the URL as the key and an array of completion handlers as the value.

&amp;#x200B;

`private static var currentDownloads = [URL: [ImageDownloadCompletion]]()`

`public typealias ImageDownloadCompletion = (UIImage?, URL) -&gt; Void`

&amp;#x200B;

I implemented a quick version of the above for [Area51](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/ac8up4/learn_ios_development_in_swift_by_contributing_to/). You can view the generic fetching code in [ImageFetcher.swift](https://github.com/kgellci/Area51/blob/master/ImageService/Sources/ImageFetcher.swift). 

Some additional convenience was added by subclassing UIImageView. I added a url property to the subclass which will automatically handle displaying the image for a given url. You can see that in [NetworkImageView.swift](https://github.com/kgellci/Area51/blob/master/ImageService/Sources/NetworkImageView.swift).

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to copy into your own project and try it out! If you have any issue, feel free to open a PR on [Area51](https://github.com/kgellci/Area51).

&amp;#x200B;

There is additional code which can be added to make even more efficient such as canceling existing downloads if the last completion handler wants to cancel.

1124,1613,2019-01-17 15:28:01,0,1,"Hello swifty Redditors,

&amp;#x200B;

I need your help.

I am trying to use `NSSegmentedControls` to transition between Child ViewControllers. The `ParentViewController` is located in `Main.storyboard` and the `ChildViewControllers` are located in `Assistant.storyboard`.

Each ChildViewController has a SegmentedControl divided into 2 Segments and their primary use is to navigate between the ChildViewControllers. So they are set up as `momentaryPushIn` rather than `selectOne`. Each ChildViewController uses a *Delegate* to communicate with the ParentViewController.

&amp;#x200B;

So in the ParentViewController I added the ChildViewControllers as following:

    /// The View of the ParentViewController configured as NSVisualEffectView
    @IBOutlet var visualEffectView: NSVisualEffectView!
    
    var assistantChilds: [NSViewController] {
        get { return [NSViewController]() }
        set(newValue) {
            for child in newValue { self.addChild(child) }
        }
    }
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do view setup here.
        addAssistantViewControllersToChildrenArray()
    }
    
    override func viewWillAppear() {
        visualEffectView.addSubview(self.children[0].view)
        self.children[0].view.frame = self.view.bounds
    }
    
    private func addAssistantViewControllersToChildrenArray() -&gt; Void {
        let storyboard = NSStoryboard.init(name: ""Assistant"", bundle: nil)
        let exampleChild = storyboard.instantiateController(withIdentifier: ""ExampleChild"") as! ExampleChildViewController
        let exampleSibling = storyboard.instantiateController(withIdentifier: ""ExampleSibling"") as! ExampleSiblingViewController
    
        exampleChild.navigationDelegate = self
        exampleSibling.navigationDelegate = self
    
        assistantChilds = [exampleChild, exampleSibling]
    }

So far so good. The  `ExampleChildViewController` has an `NSTextField` instance. While I am in the scope of the TextField, I can trigger the action of the SegmentedControls. Its navigating forward and backward as it should. But once I leave the scope of the TextField I can still click the Segments, but they are not triggering any action. They should be able to navigate forward and backward even if the TextField is not the current ""First Responder"" of the application. I think I am missing something out here, I hope anyone can help me with this. I know the problem is not the `NSSegmentedControl` because I am seeing the same behavior with an `NSButton`, which is configured as Switch/Checkbox, in the SiblingViewController. I just don't have any idea anymore what I am doing wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

**let** message = conversationSource.messageAt (index: indexPath.row)

error : Value of type 'ConversationDataSource' has no member 'messageAt'; did you mean 'messages'? Replace 'messageAt' with 'messages'

I am just starting with Swift and don't really know what this means or how to fix it?

thanks for your help!",Intro to Swift help / ChatBot

First off - I want to be able to build an app that has a database to search and log from, while having a social aspect (friends and profiles) which in turn generates a news feed of sorts. 

Ideally the app would be on iOS and Android. By learning swift, am I screwing myself when it comes to making an Android version later? 

I am a hands on learner. When I was learning Logic Pro, I had demo files to work with and it really helped me when my hands got in it. Some people say start with swift playgrounds on iPad but I want to hear your experience and suggestions. Perhaps there’s a book or course you took and would recommend.

I've been attempting to understand VIPER and other similar patterns.  I use my own flavor of MVVM where anything I move code to the View model away from the View Controller.

&amp;#x200B;

My query pertains to using structs for models.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of the examples I see, tutorials, swift playground files talk about how we should use structs to represent models.  I believe I understand the reasoning; its for speed and clarity.

&amp;#x200B;

But however; none of these examples explain how to handle model referencing.

&amp;#x200B;

That is to say, if I need one model to reference another, or I have a many-to-many relationship through another entity -- then I can't really use a struct as I'd have to find the specific instance and mutate it.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is this.  If I need to use referencing in my models (ie: Employee references an Employer) why can't I just classes  -- and more importantly, if indeed single responsibility says each file should do one job -- how would VIPER and other styles handle the relationships?",Using structs for models; but you need model referencing

Among the benefits provided by Continuous Integration (CI), increased team productivity and release frequency are perceived as the main advantages. However, changes that contain defects or that suffer from a poor-quality can lead to build failures that stop a team from delivering. The recent [Report on the State of DevOps](https://cloudplatformonline.com/2018-state-of-devops.html) states: ""When failures occur, it can be difficult to understand what caused the problem"" and previous work found that developers spend on average one hour to fix build breaks!

In our group at the University of Zurich (Switzerland), we are developing new strategies to provide developers with the right assistance to solve build failures faster and more efficiently. To achieve this, we first need to understand the state of practice from real developers and we would like to learn about your personal experience with build failures in this survey.

I would really appreciate if you could find the time to fill out the following [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdw-RuDHv7Vlu2A7I4iGm1yC99xE65lk8UmIqxMJNMIxSpGzQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to help me in my research.

Filling out the survey will take you about 7min. Please note that participating in the questionnaire is completely anonymous, but we will publish the anonymized answers as part of a scientific publication.

1183,735,2019-02-13 05:58:33,2,1,"Hello /r/swift! Im building my first application with Core Data, and wondered what the best approach for modeling the data. 

Heres the simplified setup: 

I have a class called `Note` that has a title, an icon, and a date.  

I have another class called `Entry` that has a title, description, and date. 

The `Note` can hold multiple Entries (to-many), but Entries belong to a single `Note` (to-one)

I created these classes before implementing Core Data (I know, I probably shouldn't have done that...).  So when I created the dataModel I ended up making the Entities called `NoteModel` and `EntryModel`, and added convenience init's for both `Note` and `Entry` to convert the Core Data Entities to the classes used throughout the application.  

My question is whether or not the separation of The Core Data entities, and the Objects used throughout the application is the best approach.  Or should there be one object that handles everything.

1188,42,2019-02-14 19:56:13,15,1,"I'm  a frontend dev for more than a decade, and constantly interview new  developers for 5 years. In my questions I always tried to avoid  framework-specific questions and - in the JS part - lead conversations  to mention basic and newer concepts like scope, context, browser event  handling, closures. These are things that come up with literally any google search on ""frontend interview questions"". But. In the past few  years, but also overall, I get really bad or very basic answers. Senior  devs clearly having many years of experience could at best give partial and mostly incomplete answers.

&amp;#x200B;

It  really disturbs me why, and can't find a cause for it. We could say we  just got bad candidates (I worked for 6 companies in 2 mid-european  countries, positions were with average/good salaries and actually  interesting work, not agency stuff). Or maybe that devs are so high in  demand that they just don't prepare for technical questions (I'd say in  all my interviews maybe 20% had any serious technical part).

&amp;#x200B;

But  then it occured to me how little these basic language features are used  nowadays directly. Prototypes are abstracted away for good, classes are mostly  present as built-in elements. Frameworks (and thus devs in general) use ""this"" less and less (thank God). User events are handled by frameworks in  day to day work, componentization will remove the need to think about  bubbling/capture. Conventional tasks can be solved without ""smartass""  array functions that are not map() or forEach(). I'm not even mentioning  ""low-level"" mechanics like the event loop. Frameworks and proliferation  of a few basic patterns erased high level concepting like design  patterns or phrases like higher-order functions from most daily development work.

&amp;#x200B;

I  still absolutely believe that these concepts are basic and you're flying blind if you don't know these parts of a language. But yet I  see how seemingly able professionals stumble at these questions. How  could basic concepts be explored better?

I'm trying to use JSONDecoder to convert a JSON to Structs in Swift I'm currently attempting to use JSONDecoder to convert my JSON file of a food product into a structure in which it will display in output in my console. Currently, I'm running into a mismatch error of array into dictionary. I've seen there were similar problems online however I'm new to swift so I haven't been able to take much away from it.

I realise that the issue is that I'm trying to decode an array but my file is a dictionary and that in order to achieve that the suggested method was that I need the structure, keyDecodingStrategy and convertFromSnakeCase. But I'm not sure how I do this, i've also didnt put all the fields into my structure since there was a lot 

    struct Product : Codable{ let name: String? let brands: [String]? let barcode: String? let nutriscore: String? let ingredientsList: String? } class ViewController: UIViewController { var products = [Product]() let API_URL = ""https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/5000112630794.json"" override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() Alamofire.request(API_URL).responseJSON { response in //now here we have the response data that we need to parse  let json = response.data              do{ let decoder = JSONDecoder() //think its this line   self.products = try decoder.decode([Product].self, from: json!) for product in self.products{                     print(product.name!) } }catch let err{                 print(err) } } } }

This is all fine and dandy but it still feels a bit hacky for a macOS GUI app, can anyone recommend projects, sample code, articles on this topic that could point me to a better solution?,

I've always wanted to create apps for MacOS (OS X, etc) but I've always been intimidated by the seeming infinite wealth of knowledge I have to acquire even before I can even start to think about learning Swift. Back in the day it was learning Cocoa, and then Objective-C - and when I'd pick up programming books, they always made references that went way over my head.

Now that I'm a bit more learned in the arts of programming and UI design (I took a basic online intro class to Swift/Xcode), I want to finally take the plunge and become a developer. But where should I start to get the best return for investing my time? Should I start with a course with C++? I know Objective-C is still relevant with modern MacOS apps, but how important is it?

As a background, I'm more of a systems admin but I've always wanted to write an application for people with disabilities to help them navigate their Macs a lot better. I know Apple has a lot of accessibility features in MacOS, but I know I could do a lot to help bridge the gap if I dedicated a lot of time and put my mind to it.

I always shy away from asking basic questions like this, but I figured today would be different and I'd ask for some advice. Anything shared would be much appreciated (yes, even if it's a cheeky [Google search](http://google.com/search?q=what's+the+best+way+to+learn+swift)).

I've been looking into functional programming lately and wanted to take a stab at trying to use it for iOS development. I've done some things using purely OO programming, but wanted to see if having some of the code be functional would be feasible.

I think I'd have to leave the view controllers part as OO since I don't think I have much flexibility there. But I was thinking that I could at least have a Service layer which could be purely functional. I created a new swift file with utility functions in the global scope and thought that might get messy so I opted to put them in static classes. I think I'd end up with many different static classes as my Service modules.

Am I on the right track? Is this crazy? Should I not bother with FP in iOS since it seems highly geared towards OO (even though swift itself is not necessarily so). What are some other options I could take to be as FP as possible in iOS development?

I had the basic functionality working with the route being tracked and a polylines being drawn all from within a single SessionController class, But i wanted to split the class up into separate objects.

This is where i came into problems. I put all the code that updates the location and draws polyines, etc into its own class called MapView.swift and left the @IBOutlets for the buttons, mapView, etc. In the SessionController.swift but now I can’t access the @IBOutlet for the mapView to allow the new MapView.swift class to update the current location, update polylines, etc.

When I try to ctrl+drag the mapView @IBOutlet to the MapView.swift ViewController nothing happens.

So, what I am asking is how do I link the two classes to allow access for the mapView within the SessionController to get updated with the current location.

    		// does the initial check whether the location services are enabled
    		mapScreen.checkLocationServices()
        }
    	
    	// ends the current session, resets buttons, stops updating location and changes to history tab.
    	func endSession() {
    		stopButton.isHidden = true
    		startButton.isHidden = false
    		mapScreen.stopUpdatingLocation()
    	}
    	
    	// action for when the start button is presssed.
        @IBAction func startButtonPressed(_ sender: Any) {
            mapScreen!.startUpdatingLocation()

    		stopButton.isHidden = false
        }
    	
    	// action for when the stop button is pressed.

1246,1688,2019-03-14 01:32:18,0,1,"To learn a skill successfully, people need to see how small, simple concepts add up and become more complicated as those simpler concepts coalesce into more complicated ones. The vast majority of Swift/iOS tutorials show experienced coders creating apps containing many complicated components coming together to create an even more complicated app, without breaking down those individual components first. This methodology is not helpful for people looking to learn to make apps.

&amp;#x200B;

If I was looking to learn how to play basketball, I would need to learn a lot of smaller concepts before playing in my first game. The same is true for coding. For basketball, I'd need to learn to dribble, how to shoot, how to jump, and more. After learning these skills, I would be prepared to put them all together to play in a game. I might not be good at first, but I would be prepared.  \[NPR did an excellent episode of the Hidden Brain podcast on how just watching experts perform doesn't actually teach one a skill: ([Hidden Brain episode, Feb 11, 2019](https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=691697963)).\] 

 

Were someone to try to teach me how to play basketball by simply showing me a lot of basketball games, it would not teach me how to play. There is too much to take in all at once. The same is true when it comes to building apps. Watching someone else build fully functioning apps incorporating a lot of different components will teach you to code just about as much as watching Lebron James play basketball will teach you how to play basketball.

&amp;#x200B;

So, why when it comes to coding, should the learner be expected to spend all of their time watching someone else coding fully made apps? Of course they should not! This is not an effective teaching strategy. However, over the course of countless video courses online we see the following model observed:

&amp;#x200B;

\*A few lessons on the basics of the Swift programing language itself are taught. Next, the rest of the tutorials consists of the author showing videos of them building a complicated apps displaying several different concepts at once. With their actions, they are  saying: ""I'm Lebron, now watch me play basketball, but don't spend time on the free-throw line yourself.""\* This makes zero sense.

&amp;#x200B;

An example of this might be an api weather app utilizing JSON, Codable, UI, Alamofire, and more. This app might display the information found on a stack view. Instead of teaching each element individually before going into building a fully functional app, the app developer shows a series of videos where they explain how to build all of these together.

&amp;#x200B;

If you do not know how to build all of these things separately, or if you have not at least seen these concepts individually, trying to put them together is the equivalent of seeing Lebron James cross someone over, pass the ball, get the ball back after cutting to the rim, and dunking. And then, after you've watched him to that, he expects you to be able to do so as well.

&amp;#x200B;

For someone to learn successfully, they need to see a lot of simple concepts build on one another gradually. So, before building that full-on api weather app, the learner needs to see how JSON parsing works separately from how it functions within a larger app. This is analogous to shooting a basketball. If you learn how to do it before playing in a basketball game, you can utilize it when other considerations come into play, like passing, dribbling, and the like. So, if you'd learned how to use JSON before seeing it in an app with many more components to keep track of, you'd learn how to use it successfully and could recognize how to apply it within a larger app.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is an example of a course that I think does this well: [Swift Course On TableViews](https://www.udemy.com/ios-10-swift-3-mastering-table-views/). The course begins by teaching you the basics of how a TableView works, then builds up to adding more and more functionality. Most courses like the one I described above only went into enough detail on TableViews to teach how to incorporate them into the specific app we were building, rather than how they can be used overall, then applying that methodology to the specific app.

&amp;#x200B;

Human beings learn in a lot of different ways. Overall though, we learn first by seeing the component parts of something separately, then building up those component parts into concepts that become gradually more and more complicated. Unfortunately, most app development courses online do no recognize this fact and do not effectively teach the individual components of more complicated concepts before showing someone coding using complicated concepts. This example based model is not only ineffective because it does not build up effectively, it is ineffective because it attempts to teach solely via showing an expert perform, which is the same as expecting a student to become an expert at basketball by watching Lebron James play, rather than practicing using a basketball.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you are creating a course on how to learn Swift/iOS development, please teach the component parts of the apps you are building before you build them. If it's an API weather app, teach how to parse JSON first. Then how to use Codable. Then how Alamofire works, etc... After you've taught those individual components, then dive in on how to use them all at the same time.  Your students will learn much more effectively this way.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDNR: 

1) Most Swift/iOS courses teach by showing someone code. This is an ineffective teaching style because it does not break down complicated concepts into simpler parts, building up to becoming more complicated over time.

2) If you are creating a course on how to learn Swift/iOS development, please teach the component parts of the apps you are building before you build them. Your students will learn much more effectively this way.

Relatively new to swift but having a nightmare working on this program. The project is used for image detection with CoreML where the user will import an image of a cat or dog and the program will tell the user what animal it is. The image detection work fine. Very exciting stuff, I know. 

The next stage of the program is to select a video of a cat or a dog, and it will tell which animal it is again. This is where I'm struggling, I know I need to read the video frame by frame to get a detection but I'm struggling to implement it.

Hello Swift Community! 

I’ve been learning Swift seriously since about January with the goal of switching careers from Web development to Mobile in the future. I’m attempting to build an application that will serve as a Movie or TV Guide. I'm looking for a review on what I've built out so far.


The app currently displays a list of Movies currently in theaters. Tapping on a movie poster will flip it over and display some information on the back. 


Some notes I've made so far:

* Flipping over a poster and proceeding to scroll horizontally, you can see some posters are already flipped to their description side. I figure this has to do with how dequeueResuableCell works and where I’m calling my flip method.
* I have two parsing functions that are practically identical, I'm unsure of how to make a generic parse function just yet.

* I’m currently reading on how GCD works, I want to move my network calls onto a separate thread.

* I need to learn how to do auto layout properly too. Looks best on iPhone Xs currently which is no good. 


I’m hoping for some brutally honest feedback from the community, I want to get better and write swift the right way, right now this is a product of my self guided studying. 


also, if anyone has any suggestions on features to add that would serve as good learning objectives I’d love to hear those ideas too.


Thanks so much!!",Beginner looking for a code review. Thanks in advance

However, because the pixel buffer contains so much data (&gt;5MB), I don't really want to copy the data from optionalPixelBuffer into pixelBuffer. I read the [Swift Docs on Optionals](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html#ID330) and it *seems* to suggest that the data is copied, but I'm not sure. I am hoping that the optional binding would just make pixelBuffer be a non-optional reference to the existing data that was verified to exist in optionalPixelBuffer. Is this the case? Otherwise I might be more inclined to force-unwrap like this:

```
let optionalPixelBuffer: CVPixelBuffer? = someFunctionThatReturnsOptionalCVPixelBuffer()

if optionalPixelBuffer == nil {

let a = functionUsingNonOptionalPixelBuffer(optionalPixelBuffer!)
let b = anotherFunctionUsingNonOptionalPixelBuffer(optionalPixelBuffer!)
let c = oneMoreFunctionUsingNonOptionalPixelBuffer(optionalPixelBuffer!)

I know force-unwrapping is typically frowned upon, however it may make more sense in this case; This optional exists in a local thread-safe function scope, so after the if statement checking for nil the optional *cannot* become nil before I force-unwrap it.

I'm attempting to follow this steps here [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/get-api-key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/get-api-key) under ""Generating a digital signature"" I think a big part of the problem is that even without trying to translate this into code, I don't really understand the instructions. 

Let's say my client\_id is 'EvilCorp' and my private key/cryptographic key is 'this-is-not-a-key' and the url I want to use is: **https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=Toronto&amp;destination=Montreal&amp;client=clientID**

step 1: construct the request URL without the signature, making sure to include your client parameter, note that any non-standard characters will need to be URL-encoded:

let urlToSign = ""[https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=Toronto&amp;destination=Montreal&amp;client=EvilCorp](https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=Toronto&amp;destination=Montreal&amp;client=EvilCorp)"".utf8EncodedString() 

&amp;#x200B;

step 2: strip off the domain portion of the request, leaving only the path and query:

guard let components = URLComponents(string: urlToSign) else {

return

}

let strippedURL = components.path + ""?"" + (components.query ?? """")

&amp;#x200B;

step3: retrieve your private key, which is encoded in a modified Base64 for URLs, and sign the URL above using the HMAC-SHA1 algorithm. You may need to decode this key into its original binary format. Note that in most cryptographic libraries, the resulting signature will be in binary format. 

Note: Modified Base64 for URLs replaces the + and / characters of standard Base64 with - and \_ respectively, so that these Base64 signatures no longer need to be URL-encoded. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well I'm completely flummoxed by this step. I googled Swift HMAC-SHA1 algorithm and of course stack overflow came to the rescue: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26970807/implementing-hmac-and-sha1-encryption-in-swift](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26970807/implementing-hmac-and-sha1-encryption-in-swift) but while I can get that code to compile (xcode basically suggests a fix for all the errors) I don't know how to make use of this code. 

&amp;#x200B;

For one what does ""you may need to decode this key into its original binary format"" mean? Do I need to replace any - and \_ characters in the key with + and / ? I gather that at some point I need to do something like

let hmacResult: String = strippedURL.hmac(algorithm: HMACAlgorithm.SHA1 key: ""this-is-not-a-key"")

but do I need to turn key into ""this+is+not+a+key"" first? 

Because of my my incredible confusion here I cannot get past step 3.

    let pantry = &lt;fetched object&gt;

It's hard not to be enticed by the glory and hype around Kotlin. Die hard Kotlin supporters are saying it will take over the programming world because it can do everything. As a younger programmer statements like these are very confusing to me. Based on the research of Kotlin that I have done, It seems like it could be a good option for me. Below I'll put my current programming prospectus and I would appreciate it if someone could help me to understand how Kotlin can simplify and improve it.

&amp;#x200B;

So I created an Image class (Image.swift):

    class Image: NSObject, NSCoding {
        struct Keys {
            static let imageFileName = ""imageFileName""
            static let displayCount = ""displayCount""
        }
    
        var imageFileName: String
        var displayCount: Int
    
        init(imageFileName: String, displayCount: Int) {
            self.imageFileName = imageFileName
            self.displayCount = displayCount
        }
    
        required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
            imageFileName = aDecoder.decodeObject(forKey: Keys.imageFileName) as? String ?? """"
            displayCount = aDecoder.decodeObject(forKey: Keys.displayCount) as? Int ?? 0
        }
        func encode(with aCoder: NSCoder) {
            aCoder.encode(imageFileName, forKey: Keys.imageFileName)
            aCoder.encode(displayCount, forKey: Keys.displayCount)
        }
    }

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I defined

    var pictures = [Image]()

and

    struct Keys {
        static let pictures = ""pictures""
    }

in ViewController.swift.

&amp;#x200B;

And in accordance with the tutorial, I created a save() method in ViewController.swift as follows:

    func save() {
        if let encodedData = try? NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: pictures,     requiringSecureCoding: false) {
            defaults.set(encodedData, forKey: Keys.pictures)
        }
    }

&amp;#x200B;

This save() method is first invoked in fetchImages() in viewDidLoad():

    @objc func fetchImages() {
        if let savedImages = defaults.object(forKey: Keys.pictures) as? Data {
            if let decodedImages = try? NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveTopLevelObjectWithData(savedImages) as? [Image] {
                pictures = decodedImages ?? [Image]()
            }
        }
        if pictures.isEmpty {
            let fm = FileManager.default
            let path = Bundle.main.resourcePath!
            var items = try! fm.contentsOfDirectory(atPath: path)
            items.sort()
            for item in items {
                if item.hasPrefix(""nssl"") {
                    let image = Image(imageFileName: item, displayCount: 0)
                    pictures.append(image)
                }
            }
            save()
        }
        tableView.performSelector(onMainThread: #selector(tableView.reloadData), with: nil, waitUntilDone: false)
    }

&amp;#x200B;

And again in the UITableView Delegate Method of didSelectRowAt, after the displayCount of the image is updated:

    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
        if let vc = storyboard?.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: ""Detail"") as? DetailViewController {
            vc.selectedImage = pictures[indexPath.row].imageFileName
            vc.selectedImagePosition = indexPath.row + 1
            vc.totalImages = pictures.count
            navigationController?.pushViewController(vc, animated: true)
            pictures[indexPath.row].displayCount += 1
            save()
            tableView.reloadData()
        }
    }

&amp;#x200B;

===============================

Problem:

For some reason, while the value of displayCount in the pictures array increments successfully, this increment is not saved to UserDefaults in the didSelectRowAt method even though the save() method works as expected in fetchImages().

===============================

&amp;#x200B;

I'm learning swift and for my first little program I'm trying to make a little game using Sprite Kit. What I'm trying to do is detect when a key is pressed so I can move my node across the screen. For the life of me, I cannot get this to work. What am I doing wrong?


```
override func keyDown(with event: NSEvent) {
        print(""Detecting key press"")
        if event.keyCode == KeyCode.d {
            print(""Pressed D"")
        }
    }
```


Everywhere I've read this code is supposed to work. But it is not detecting anything. From what I understand it's overriding a NSWindow function, but even putting it inside my ViewController class doesn't work. Am I supposed to call it during my game loop? I figured it would act like an event, and would be called automatically.


Here's all of my code so far.


**ViewController.swift**

```

        if let view = self.skView {

            scene = GameScene(size: view.bounds.size)
            // Set the scale mode to scale to fit the window
            scene.scaleMode = .resizeFill
            
            // Present the scene
            view.presentScene(scene)
            
            view.ignoresSiblingOrder = true
            
            view.showsFPS = true
            view.showsNodeCount = true
        }
    }
}

Today, I'm sharing with you the very first video tutorial for glide engine 🙌

Tutorial: [https://youtu.be/Fx7Cv6-WjMQ](https://youtu.be/Fx7Cv6-WjMQ)

At the end of this tutorial you'll have a very simple platformer game with a controllable and animated character which can walk on a platform. It's a super simple tutorial which can get you started from zero. You'll have some familiarity with the basic concepts of the engine.

The video comes with carefully crafted captions and a companion GitHub repo for you to easily follow. Please let me know your questions and feedback about this tutorial. glide engine is always evolving and improving and it's always open to contributions on GitHub as well.

First know that I do not write a ton of swift. I do a lot of python and bash. I am attempting to write an app to register some Macs in my org and then do some actions for our on boarding process. There are some published items out there but they do not serve my orgs purpose so I figured id tool my own.

&amp;#x200B;

What I want is for the app to load up to a welcome screen, and then check if its registered already, then if needed issue a register pop over. That works great, got all that done and I'm happy with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Then once the registration is complete, the continue button lights up and when they press it they come to another view controller that will show them the configuration progress. That is where I am hung up. If I just link the continue button to the new ViewController it opens in a new window. That is not what I want. I want that ViewController to replace the current one.

&amp;#x200B;

My google search told me that perhaps a Container View was in order. Everything I have found is for iOS and tabbed views etc. This is not 100% relevant. Does anyone have any advice for getting the Container View to switch between a few different ViewControllers? How is this normally accomplished?

~~~
enum SomeReference: String {
    case
        users
        usersData =  “users/\(someUserId)/userData”

 “users” and “users/xczbxvxncb/userData”

Hey guys,

I'm currently rewriting a small program I have written in python in swift. 

&amp;#x200B;

In essence it is a note taking program that stores notes in a dict with tags as keys. The values are arrays of notes that each contain their tag and the note text (it will later be stored as son but that's not important right now).

The function add\_note will add the note to the dictionary. The function checks if the tag is already in the dictionary. If it is, it will append the note to the array, else it will add the tag to the dict and set its value to an array containing the note.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my question: the `if let` syntax sets `tagdict[note.tag]` as optional right? So if the tag exists, it will return `true`, else it will return `nil` which will be evaluated as `false`, is this correct?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't quite understand why in the if clause `tagdict[note.tag]` still is an optional. If I don't use the optional ?, Xcode will throw an error. Shouldn't it be NOT an optional, since if I jump into the if clause, then there is value?

I'm a frequent traveller and I spend a lot of time on the airports and in the plane. Although my primary job isn't programming, I spend a lot of time with my iPad Pro prototyping apps I want to build.

Recently, my company switched from Macs to Windows devices which makes my iPad Pro the only apple computer I'm travelling with. It's great for taking down notes, thoughts, ideas but... does anyone have any experiences with actually writing a code on it?

I know xcode does not exist on iPad, but is there any simmilar/recommended app that would help me to write the code on iPad while on the go? Or maybe - does anyone have experience in developing with swift on Windows machines (e.g. through linux)?

want to learn how to manipulate images and videos maybe. All the good stuff, from making http requests to all the

other stuff it needs to create complete apps. My problem? I don't know where to learn it.

I worked through apple's ""Learn swift"" pdf/book. That was good for basics, variables, functions, types and stuff.

But I wasn't taught how to make requests nor connect to a database for example. I tried finding stuff on youtube

but it's mostly outdated and not swift 5 anymore. On udemy, the courses aren't being kept up to date either, which

is very sad (Maximilian Schwarzmueller has been keeping his angular and react courses active for years!!!).

Ray Wenderlich has a good website, even though there is only a beginner track for iOS and the rest is some

randomly mixed guides and short video tutorials which confuse me even more. Where do these people learn it?

Should I learn obj-c instead? Does it have more learning material on these topics?

&amp;#x200B;

My problem might also be that I always learned everything, I try to get on advanced topics quite fast. I want to know how everything works under the hood which is my big flaw. Using a framework/library? Hell I have to know how it works under the hood, maybe some day it won't get updated and I have to update it myself. This makes learning for me very hard.

I'm poking around on the interface, and I don't see anything that looks like a direct message mechanism. I see a chat thing, so maybe you meant we could start a chat? I'm not an idiot, I promise.

1417,0,2019-06-21 03:46:18,3,0,"Web design continues to evolve on an annual basis, as new technology and fresh ways of thinking replace out-dated methods. Compounding this evolution is the acceptance that a website’s presence lives or dies by the whims of the search engine, with any stragglers hit with a potential drop in rankings. To put it blunty, optional techniques become necessary the moment Google changes its rules, so it’s important to keep an eye on future web design trends for your website to adapt in good time.

A desire to stand out

After more than two decades of the internet, it makes sense that websites may begin to look the same in their efforts to provide the best experience. Contrary to this, we expect to see a rise in diversity in the coming year, with more websites using asymmetry to catch the eye and big typography in place of meaningless stock photography. Companies are beginning to learn that one size won’t fit all, and must strive to be memorable in order to attract new business.

Minimalist design will continue to grow too, using a combination of text, space and bold colour to provide unique visuals that break away from the popular ‘black on white space’ look. Couple this with the reserved use of parallax scrolling, a video background or full-screen slider and you have the makings of a site that’s primed and ready for 2019.

An increase in speed and performance

More important today than it was a few years ago, the speed of your website is not only a key ranking factor, but paramount to actually having your content read at all. Google has reportedly found that 53% of users will abandon a website after three seconds, which is a stark warning to any slow movers looking to increase their consumer base in 2019.

Thankfully, this is a requirement that more businesses and developers are beginning to wake up to. As such, we’re likely to see more websites that prioritise speed using smart, minimal code and optimised imagery to reduce loading where possible.

The mobile web &amp; progressive web apps

Even if your website responds on handheld devices, it’s worth checking its usability. With Google now placing greater emphasis on a site’s mobile version over its desktop counterpart, a crudely designed website that’s technically mobile responsive will no longer cut it long-term. The progressive web app (or PWA for short) is a fresh alternative to both the mobile web and the native app, such as one you would download from an app store. The PWA has already been picked up by the likes of Twitter, Forbes and The Washington Post and is in a very strong position moving forwards.

The progressive web app uses less data than a native app, loads swiftly and can be seen in search engines because it exists on the web. We have yet to see the upper limits of this technology, but given their many selling points and few disadvantages, PWAs could easily become the most effective answer to the responsive web in 2019.

Speaking of optimised imagery, we’ve seen a surge in websites presenting big, crisp images that look fantastic on retina screens. This equates to a simple case of cause and effect – as technology improves and the adoption rate rises, you inevitably see an increase in companies willing to target that specific audience. This just means nicer imagery for all concerned.

While animation has graced many an ‘upcoming trends’ article and has yet to emerge as a web design staple, it’s nonetheless something you can expect to see grow as time goes on. Most sites probably won’t centre their entire content around fancy animations just yet, but you can expect to see them used on a smaller, subtle scale that won’t distract too much from the main primary content.

Greater customer focus

While the push for appealing visuals will always be at the forefront of design, recent times have seen a greater emphasis on the user-experience. Businesses are starting to understand that an effective website needs to guide the user on a journey; one that’s held together with tight content, few clicks and a powerful call-to-action. It’s at last becoming understood that potential customers need to be sold on the company’s service, by persuading them that it can solve a problem or fill a need in their lives.

The rise of the landing page is also very topical, as companies learn to advertise themselves and attempt to convert hesitant users into paying customers. Essentially, we can expect to see greater focus given to a website’s structure, with fewer menu tabs and less clicks needed to find relevant content.

• in app payments 
• international app (I don’t know if that’s important or even a thing lol bear with me please)

So the thing is I started to learn how Firebase works and I even created my login/sign up page etc. but I can't understand the logic of creating a new quiz.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, I want to create different categories, and when someone clicks on ""English Quizzes"" category, he should be able to see the list of quizzes that created by other people and they must be listed from most used to the least. Also, he can create a quiz and add it to the list. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course I am not expecting someone to give me an entire code but I am confused about its logic. 

Can someone PLEASE explain it?

Btw I am sorry if I have grammer mistakes. I am not a native speaker.

Thank you!","I am stuck, AGAIN! I need your help, AGAIN!"

&amp;#x200B;

Just stumbled upon this lesson yesterday night and thought it would be a nice thing to follow while learning swift!

&amp;#x200B;

When I started it, I didn't realise it was for Swift 3! That being said, Apple goes on about how compatible swift is with itself and how easy it is.

I'm just struggling on a simple bit, ""Setup the button action"" 

&amp;#x200B;

`button.addTarget(self, action: #selector(RatingControl.ratingButtonTapped(button:)), for: .touchUpInside)`

this gives me the error

""Cannot convert value of type '(RatingControl) -&gt; (UIButton) -&gt; ()' to expected argument type 'String'""

1446,121,2019-07-05 20:48:38,3,0,"I am trying to create a questionnaire in Xcode using swift (tableview) where the user of the app can choose their preferred choice (for example one question can be, what days are you available? and the user has a list of options to choose from and can select multiple)

To do this, I have created a variable called potans (short for potential answers) and another variable called selectedans which holds the information regarding the selected answers.

When the user clicks one of the answers, a checkmark appears next to the selected choice and also the row number of the selected answer is printed. When the user again clicks on the already selected option, they automatically deselect it and the checkmark is removed and the row number of the deselected row is again printed.

I would like to be able to store the selected answer/s when the user presses the 'next button'. However, since the user can change their mind (select and then deselect) and can select multiple answers, I do not know how to convert the information of row number to the string name. 

So when the user presses (refer to the code I have written) ans1, a checkmark appears and row:0 is printed (output). If the user does not do anything else and presses the 'next button' everything is alright. However, if the user deselects ans1 (we get another row:0 printed) and then selected ans2 and ans3 (where we then get row:1 and row:2 printed), so what line of code would I need to add to be able to conclude that the final answers of the user have been ans2 and ans3?

I had thought of somehow making two of the same row numbers (either consecutively or not) cancel out but I do not know how to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

    var potans = [""ans1"", ""ans2"", ""ans3"", ""ans4"", ""ans5""]
    
    var selectedans:[String] = []
    
    //some irrelevant code here

        return potans.count
    }
    
    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UITableViewCell {
        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: ""cell"", for: indexPath)
        cell.textLabel?.text = potans[indexPath.row]
        let selectedView = UIView()
        selectedView.backgroundColor = UIColor(red:0.65, green:0.85, blue:0.62, alpha:1.0)
        cell.selectedBackgroundView = selectedView
    
        return cell
    
    }
    
    override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
    
        if tableView.cellForRow(at: indexPath as IndexPath)?.accessoryType == .checkmark
        {
            tableView.cellForRow(at: indexPath as IndexPath)?.accessoryType = .none
        } else {
    
            tableView.cellForRow(at: indexPath as IndexPath)?.accessoryType = .checkmark
        }
    
        selectedans.append(potans[indexPath.row])
    
        print(""row: \(indexPath.row)"")
    }

        self.performSegue(withIdentifier: ""segue"", sender: self)

Web development has turned out very important, and the reputation of Python frameworks seems to witness a considerable rise. Python has a gentle learning curve. Some of its powerful features include object-oriented nature, great architecture, and interactive nature. The development time is hugely decreased through its simple syntax and compilation characteristic. The code of Python is also maintainable and brief. 

The programmers apply a plethora of Python web frameworks to write custom web applications in [Python](https://www.softlogicsys.in/python-training-in-chennai/) swiftly and competently. Now lets some of the best Python web frameworks. 

**CherryPy**

CherryPy is an object-oriented Python framework and is opens source. It consists of its own multi-threaded web server, and anyone can contribute to it. Any web application formed using CherryPy can be run on every Python-supported OSes comprising Unix/Linux,     Mac, and Windows. 

You can develop smaller source codes rapidly through CherryPi. Module framework and setup framework lets it simplify data access, handling of sessions, etc.  Another striking feature of CherryPy is that developers can run several HTTP servers simultaneously. This efficient framework is more than a decade old and has proven its expertise in speed. 

**Django**

This framework is opensource and motivates quick development and neat, realistic design. Its primary purpose is to assist developers in taking applications from initialization to completion as early as possible. 

Django has a vast range of libraries and ground-breaking features including content supervision, authentication mechanism, URL routing, etc. Besides, it supports databases, including Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc. It is one of the most demanded full-stack frameworks due to its smooth web development, reusable elements, less coding, etc. 

**Bottle**

Bottle is a small-scale Python framework. It was initially intended for developing web APIs. It is framed to be very small and hence attempts to implement everything in a single source file.  Apart from the Python Standard Library, Bottle has no dependencies needed for framing small web applications. 

Bottle is equipped with adapter support for third-party template engines. Its innovative functionalities comprise templating, directing, etc.  Another remarkable point about Bottle is that it lets developers function closer to the hardware. 

**CubicWeb**

It is famous as a semantic web application framework.  Besides adhering to common object-oriented programming principles, CubiicWeb further enhances custom web application development by offering reusable elements named cubes. 

Several cubes are bundled together to form an instance applying a database, a web server, and some configuration files. RQL  (Relational Query Langauge) is a query language used In this framework, and this eases data-related queries.  

**Flask** 

The chief purpose of this framework is to assist in developing a robust web application base. Flask consists of a built-in debugger and also development server. Besides, it is equipped with secure cookies, Jinja 2 templating, etc. 

Though there is no presence of built-in database interaction in Flask, there is a sqlalchemy package that will link an SQL database to a Flask application. Flask facilitates unit testing and lets secure client-side sessions. 

**Pyramid**

Pyramid Python framework ‘s objective is to accomplish as much as possible with less complexity. It is impressive for developing big web applications like CMSs. Besides, it is flexible and can be applied for both simple and challenging projects. 

There are flexible authorization and authentication with Pyramid. Pyramid also boosts custom web application development by offering features including routing, templating, etc. Its security arrangements seem to be reliable. 

**Conclusion**

Several Python web development frameworks will be of use to the developers. We have listed some of the best. The coders should evaluate each framework according to the requirements.

They can only do 1 video+quiz a day. My friend is making all the questions and finding the videos to put into our app - I will be doing all the coding and app development. We want to eventually get it on the app store.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Obligatory ""i am a beginner"" ... My only prior coding experience was a Java course in high school where the most complex thing covered was recursion, so I know programming basics. I have completed all 1000 pages of Apple's App Development with Swift iBook and watched a couple tutorial playlists by CodeWithChris, so I am now pretty familiar with Swift syntax and Xcode. I've drawn some wireframes of the app, and my friend and I have created a trello with all the features we want in it. My question now is how do I go about making this app? By that I mean a few specific key features to it, I already know how to set it up (it's looking like table view controllers + a tab bar at the bottom).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I need to figure out:

* An efficient way to incorporate hundreds, if not thousands of questions (15 per video, 1 video per day) that accompany a youtube video. Some research has led me to put it in JSON format which I will have to decode into my app. I just don't want a really long swift file composed of 1000+ questions and video URLs on it...
* 3 of the 15 quiz questions are supposed to be recurring from the previous day's quiz to test the user's memory. However this feature might be too hard for a beginner like me to figure out, or something I will add later.
* Some sort of timer that only allows the user to watch one video + quiz combo a day. I've found [this](https://www.raywenderlich.com/113835-ios-timer-tutorial) tutorial which I think will help me with that. There will be local notifications to notify the user daily of a new video.
* How to have the user tap the video and the app will redirect them to either safari or youtube (if they have it installed). This shouldn't be hard to figure out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Some things to clarify:

* There will be no user profiles as I am trying to stay away from databases, but I probably do need some persistence so the daily video+quiz combo doesn't repeat itself.
* The reason the user can only do one video+quiz per day is because we don't want users burning through all our content.

It’s my last year of high school (only 2 months left) and I cannot wait!! 

This year I’m doing 2 computing related subjects (algorithmics and software development) and i got very interested in programming, logic and solving puzzles. I always wanted to learn to code and build apps but i never found a good way until in SoftwareDev, i had to make a web app and it’s due next month. They instructed us to use php, HTML and CSS and that’s what I’m doing right now, so far so good. But i want to take it to the next level.. 
I own most apple products and I’m absolutely in love with how they work together! I do something on my iPhone, finish where i left off on my iPad and do the rest on my Mac.. this seamless integration is what keeps me in this ecosystem but for now, i think it’s time for me to actually do something with ecosystem. Create my own apps that me and everyone else can use and benefit from. 
I’m planning to take a gap year and during that time, continue my part time job and really focus on acquiring some serious skills and one is learning iOS development. But i want to start now! As mentioned, I’m not a total beginner in programming, i understand data types, functions and basic operations in programming. But i want to utilise this knowledge and create something real with it. I’m aware that this new thing called SwiftUI is out! I don’t know what that is but it seems so cool! Everyday i get excited and inspired by seeing the possibilities! I’m blown away every time i go to App Store, i think to myself, if these people can, why can’t i? Surely it’s not some magical superpower.. people are making music apps, note taking apps, workout apps, you name it! It’s crazy how so many of them are JUST FOR IOS!
I have Xcode on my Mac but i don’t understand a thing in there!

Currently I have different ideas for some apps i can make just for iPhone, iPad and Mac. Not web, not a simple script, an APP.

So you guys, the experienced programmers and developers, where can i start learning Swift to make apps? (Please don’t recommend swift playgrounds, it’s too basic)

1487,2181,2019-07-23 15:01:49,8,22,"Scripting is one of my favourite tasks in my day-to-day work. Scripting is quick, simple and useful. Currently, scripting is mainly done in dynamic/interpreted languages like Bash script, Ruby, Perl and Python.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to see how hard it was to use Swift for scripting, and it is not that hard. Using the \`swift\` interpreter that comes when you install Xcode makes things easy.

&amp;#x200B;

you only need to begin your scripts with:

    #!/usr/bin/env swift

And you are ready to go.

One of the most useful tools to use in your Swift scripts is `Process`. It allows you to create a sub-process where you can run other command-line tools. For example:

&amp;#x200B;

    #!/usr/bin/env swift
    import Foundation
    
    let ls = Process()
    ls.executableURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: ""/usr/bin/env"")
    ls.arguments = [""ls"", ""-al""]
    do{
      try ls.run()
    }

&amp;#x200B;

That script will call `ls` on the current directory. That might not be the most useful script, but it shows the general structure on how to execute a command form Swift scripts.

&amp;#x200B;

Swift is not the mainstream choice for a scripting language, but it surely can be used as one. The best part is that you don't need to learn a new language. You can use the one you already know.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to read more on how to use Swift for your scripts or if you know someone that only knows Swift and might want to use it for scripting, I wrote a post that explains the most common scenarios that you might encounter while writing your scripts. As always, all feedback is welcome.

I'm writing a simple app that stores items in NSUserDefaults using Combine. It has a main view, which is a List of all the items, and the items have a detail view that you get to from the main view.

It all works fine until I try to delete an item from the main view. The app will crash saying that a value in the detail view is nil:

This is a piece of code that I basically took from Apple's swiftUI tutorial. The DetailView gets a Routine object from the List view and makes this property to make sure I'm editing the right object.

What I don't understand I guess is why this piece of code crashes even though its view isn't on the screen anymore. The weird thing is is that if I quit my app and then try to delete it, it works. It's like the DetailView is being held in memory somewhere and causing the crash.

I'm exploring SwiftUI and I've run into something I cannot quite figure out.

I have created a container view that can fetch data on appear as described in [this](https://mecid.github.io/2019/07/31/introducing-container-views-in-swiftui/) post, but instead of complete changing the object referenced in the data rendering view, I just load some of its properties. This is my implementation:

    protocol ValueLoader: Combine.ObservableObject {
        associatedtype Value

        var data: Value { get set }
        func load()

    struct ValueLoadingContainerView&lt;ValueConsumer: View, ValueContainer: ValueLoader&gt;: View {

        let containedView: (ValueContainer.Value) -&gt; ValueConsumer

            self.valueLoader = loader

        }

        var body: some View {
            containedView(valueLoader.data)
                .onAppear(perform: load)
        }

        private func load() {
            self.valueLoader.load()
        }
    }

    class Object {
        let id: String
        var title: String?

        func load(from ....) {
            self.title = ...
        }
    }

    struct ConcreteLoader: ValueLoader {
        @Published var data: Object

        func load() {
            ...
            self.objectWillChange.send()
            self.valueToLoad.load(from: ...)
        }
    }

    struct ObjectRenderingView: View {
        let object: Object
        
        var body: some View {
            Text(object.title ?? ""ObjectRenderingView is waiting..."")
        }
    }
    
    let object = Object(id: ""1"", title: nil)
    
    // Finally the actual usage of the classes.
    ValueLoadingContainer(ConcreateLoader(object),

                          })

The text label (1) is correctly updated and displays the object title once it has been loaded, but the `ObjectRenderingView` (2) is not rendered again and still displays a loading message. If I add print statements I indeed see that the `contained` ViewBuilder is called again with the loaded channel, but the `ObjectRenderingView` body property is not accessed again. I assume it has something to do with the fact that Object is class instead of a struct (like `obj.title`), but I'm not sure how to solve this. 

Can someone explain why this happens?",Passing a class as SwiftUI data

I'm excited to share a library I've been working on, called [Scout](https://github.com/bgerstle/Scout).

    protocol Example {
        var foo: String { get }

        var foo: String

        }
    
        func baz() {
            bazWasCalled = true
        }
    }

Then you should give Scout a try:

    class MockExample : Example, Mockable {
        let mock = Mock()
        
        var foo: String {
            get {

            try! mock.call.baz()

    }
    // Example usage:
    func testCallsBazIfFooIsBaz() {
        mockExample.expect.foo.to(`return`(""baz""))
        mockExample.expect.baz().toBeCalled()

I'm interested in taking a deep dive into programming. I have very rudimentary experience in HTML/CSS, C#, and Flutter/Dart, but I want to take a step back and restart from the ground floor. Python seems like the answer, as its one of the easiest and most productive languages that also offers a lot of power and many different use cases.

I think a career in programming could be interesting, fun, and rewarding. No degree is necessary, which is a big deal breaker for me. I'm only 19, but I decided to not return to college for several reasons, some of which are currently beyond my control.

The problem is a lack of interest in science, mathematics, and any MATLAB type stuff. But I've heard Python is also used in things like automating tasks, building visual effects pipelines for film/TV (which does interest me), machine learning/AI, and server-side/back-end stuff.

Are there a lot of jobs in Python that **don't** deal with science and math on the programmer side of things? Is Python a wise choice when seeking jobs in general? I've heard Java/C# might be more in demand (but I'd like to really learn Python first).

This is the flow of the app (this was taken before converting this to use coordinators).

It has 3 flows.

Auth - Phone no input screen, OTP verification screen

Products - Products list screen, Product detail screen

Settings - About screen

        func verify() {
            let verifyViewController = VerifyViewController.instantiate()
            verifyViewController.coordinator = self

    }
    

**SettingsCoordinator.swift**

    class SettingsCoordinator: Coordinator {
        var childCoordinators = [Coordinator]()
        var navigationController: UINavigationController
        
        init(navigationController: UINavigationController) {
            self.navigationController = navigationController
        }
        
        func start() {
            let settingsViewController = SettingsViewController.instantiate()

        func about() {
            let aboutViewController = AboutViewController.instantiate()
            navigationController.pushViewController(aboutViewController, animated: true)
        }
    }

The app is initialized with the `AuthCoordinator` and at the end of that flow, the `MainViewController` (`UITabBarController` subclass) is displayed. The other two coordinators are initialized there.

    class MainViewController: UITabBarController {
        let productsCoordinator = ProductsCoordinator(navigationController: UINavigationController())
        let settingsCoordinator = SettingsCoordinator(navigationController: UINavigationController())
        
        override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
            super.viewWillAppear(animated)
            navigationController?.navigationBar.isHidden = true
        }
        
        override func viewDidLoad() {
            super.viewDidLoad()
            productsCoordinator.start()
            settingsCoordinator.start()
            
            viewControllers = [productsCoordinator.navigationController, settingsCoordinator.navigationController]
        }
    }

This all works well. My problem is now I want to add the logout functionality in the Settings view. But I'm not sure how to do that with coordinators. It's buried deep within the app's screens. Do I dismiss the `ProductsCoordinator` and `SettingsCoordinator` and ""pop"" back to the `AuthCoordinator` somehow? Or do I initialize another instance of `AuthCoordinator`?

There are pretty good implementations given in the literature, but they rely on looking at protected members of the class. 

This makes sense, as we want to know if the base class takes advantage of its super class. I.e. if it accesses its parents protected members as these cannot be called from the outside. In swift however we do not have the protected keyword. This is a problem here since we cannot determine if a subclass refuses to use its parents members or if it is just happy inheriting them (as they might be used from outside objects). 

I'm using Sourcekitten to index the source files. My first idea was to see if the reference usr would give me information about the use of inherited members, but the reference points to the members of the parent class. So there is no information if the inherited members of a class are used anywhere in the code.

My .ts and .js experience is not at a point where I feel super comfortable (hence why I can't solve this). So i'm trying to get document content from one document to another. Currently doing it via snapshots though i'm sure there's faster and better ways. My code is below.

The error happens when I try to set the second collection (redacted2)'s document to the snapshot data. As you can tell from the console logs, I know that the snapshot.data() has the valuable information I need formatted exactly the way I want it to be.

Obviously there's personal preference and all that, but I was wondering what the **""go-to""** program for UI/UX designing is? I am by no means a UI designer... ask me to draw a cat and it will end up looking like an apache attack helicopter. But my sister is, and we are collaborating on a project together and I've asked her for graphic design support.

She has a lot of experience in Adobe illustrator, photoshop, lightroom, premier, etc. She is a kickass painter as well. So I feel like Adobe XD would feel more like at home.

But then there's also Sketch, and to my knowledge (please correct me if I am wrong), Sketch outputs the design you do as Swift code? Is this correct? And if so, is it really all that useful?

I would imagine that as a programmer, if I receive UI design from the designer, I would just do my best to code it according to the design, obviously given that the UI designer in my case doesn't know a thing about Swift or about designing for a software to give proper parameters and all that.

1576,2381,2019-09-16 06:37:25,4,5,"I started playing with SPM last week, and I'm planning to use it to make some (non-iOS/MacOS) software. I soon ran into a conflict with dependencies which took me a while to figure out, and when I did, it didn't make sense that it would even be an issue. So I'd just like to check if I'm being dumb.

I got the conflict because I had two dependencies:

* Nimble (a testing framework), from 8.0.0 (the current latest release)
* LineNoise (a readline utility)

When running swift build, I got a cryptic error about conflicting dependencies, but only LineNoise was mentioned. It turns out the SPM folks are aware that these messages are unhelpful, so moving on. The cause of the conflict is that LineNoise also has Nimble as a dependency, but it requires Nimble from 7.0.0.

Which, OK, technically my package now references two versions of Nimble. But this is on an unrealistically simple package that I just made to play with SPM, which I ran into because one of the two (*two!*) packages I want to use didn't update its dependencies. Does this mean that, if I want to work on a real project with potentially dozens of dependencies (my day job app uses &gt;40 pods), SPM would require that for any dependency with its own dependencies, everything has to be on the same version? That sounds like it would quickly make the ecosystem unusable. In my experience, open source projects can't always keep their stuff up to date all through the year, and many get abandoned. Normally, an abandoned project will still work until the language itself introduces breaking changes, but with this, they would break as soon as any of their dependencies are updated.

In practice, I only want to use the public API of the main target of LineNoise. I don't care which version of Nimble it uses for its test target. I should be able to use version 8 of Nimble for my own tests, and LineNoise should be able to have its own copy of version 7 which is not exposed to my package; this shouldn't be a conflict.

Is there an easy way to resolve these kinds of conflicts that I'm just missing, or is it really going to be such a mission to keep conflict resolution at bay in SPM?",Question about dependency conflicts in Swift Package Manager

Is there a way I could use swift to log into the site, search up these products and pdf/print the pages I need?

We building an app using SwiftUI and everything is running as expected until I decided to build an archive. When building the archive the swift compiler would crash.

After much head scratching I finally found the culprit and the solution:

The following declaration is being used to trigger a sheet:

This compiles without warnings and runs perfectly fine. Without changing it to the following:

`@State var itemToPresent: Item? = nil`

1596,1261,2019-09-27 14:05:37,15,1,"Hi all.

I’m in the process of making my first app for iOS (followed by iPadOS and watchOS) and I want to create a web app and an Android app. The idea is to give users synchronisation of their data between platforms (e.g. they start using the iOS app and they can pick up where they left off on Android or web). I plan on using Firebase as my cloud storage solution.

I’ve learned swift and I’m in the process of learning Java. I haven’t started learning JavaScript and I would prefer not to if possible because it would take up a great deal of time as I work full time in finance on top of developing my own apps by myself. I’m really considering writing my web app in Swift using Vapor as I’m already familiar with Swift. I could learn JavaScript but that would drastically delay the launch date of my apps as I’m looking to release the iOS, Android and web apps at the same time. The reason I’m doing this is because cross-platform sync is the key selling point of my apps.

The question is: how feasible would it be to write my web app in Swift using Vapor instead of writing it in JavaScript and which language is more robust when it comes to the development of web apps and back end development?",Swift vs JavaScript for Web Development

1598,1259,2019-09-28 16:33:01,13,25,"I'm not sure if this is already known, but it's something I found playing around with swift. Calling functions with a tuple representing multiple arguments was removed in Swift 3, but I found a way you can still do it if you really want to.

Take this function:

&amp;#x200B;

    func greet(first: String, last: String) {
    
        print(""Hello, \(first) \(last)"")
    
    }

&amp;#x200B;

The following approach produces an error:

&amp;#x200B;

    let tuple = (first: ""John"", last: ""Doe"")
    
    greet(tuple)

&amp;#x200B;

    ""Error, passing 2 arguments to a callee as a single tuple value has been removed in Swift 3""

&amp;#x200B;

However, you can cast the function to a function that takes a single tuple argument and then call it with the tuple:

&amp;#x200B;

    (greet as! ((String, String)) -&gt; ())(tuple) // Hello, John Doe

&amp;#x200B;

This also works with generics, so you can abstract it into a function:

&amp;#x200B;

    func call&lt;T, U&gt;(_ closure: (T) -&gt; U, with args: T) -&gt; U {
    
        return closure(args)
    
    }

&amp;#x200B;

    call(greet, with: tuple) // Hello, John Doe",You can call functions with tuples in Swift 3+

However, I am still wondering about some things. Firstly will I really be fully limited to Apple environment and eventually a small Linux support? I know that there is a way to compile for windows using an open-source project but I heard that it doesn't support the Foundation library which I guess is a huge step back. For example, I would like to attempt making some libraries using swift which could be used then as a native library file with any language, or even making a cross-platform game with OpenGL (if needed I can compile two versions, one with metal for apple hardware and OpenGL for others), is it attainable?

Also, a lot of my projects on ios will probably require a sort of ""runtime compiler"" but I guess that this won't be as simple as with the JVM class loader.

I should say that I'm a beginner when it comes to OSX programming, I haven't done system-specific development before. The closest I've come to this is web development.

One of the things I've struggled with when trying to build things for OSX is not knowing what it is I'm looking. For example, I want my app to be able to change the window position of other apps. What would I type into my search engine?
- ""OSX Swift modify other windows""?
- ""AppKit Swift modify other windows""?

I suspect my trouble comes from not knowing what framework has what I need.

My next question has to do with understanding how my classes in swift are instantiated. From some of the poking around in swift, I've often been confused by what class is controlling my user interface views, when they are created, and when I should even make my own class vs write code somewhere else. Also, how to communicate between controllers has been difficult. Are there any good resources that explain how this works?

My last question is, where should I go for documentation? Apple's new documentation seems okay at best, and sometimes they link to archived stuff written in objective c?

Or do most people solve these problems from experience and hours of research to find the one stack overflow post needed?

Thank you for your help! &lt;3

They are handy to track system events without having to resource to polling. We register our `kqueue` and notify the server that we are interested in specific events. When the kernel sees an event we are interested in, it pushes it to our queue.

`kqueues` allow us to track events for sockets, files, timers, processes, memory and some more.

For example, we could get notified when a socket is ready for reading or writing. Also, we could get notified if there are some memory-related events for our process (e.g. jetsam). Or if a file got any attributes changed.

I wrote a post on how to use `kqueue`  in Swift. If you are interested, here is the link:

Trying to cross-compile a simple arm64 executable from macOS to Linux using the toolchains from [SwiftCrossCompilers](https://github.com/CSCIX65G/SwiftCrossCompilers). I'm using `swiftc` to emit an IR file (.ll), which then I pipe to clang to get an object (.o) file. The process looks something like this:

```
swiftc -swift-version 5 -sdk $(SWIFT_SDK) -tools-directory $(SWIFT_TOOLS) -target aarch64-unknown-linux -emit-ir -parse-as-library -static-stdlib main.swift -o main.ll

clang -target aarch64-none-eabi -ffreestanding -fpic -Wno-override-module -c main.ll -o main.o
```

**Note**: I'm using a Makefile, so variables like `$(SWIFT_SDK)` are populated and pointing to the right directories on my machine.

So far so good. Inspecting the resulting object using `file` gives the following:
`ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped`

There are a couple other standard .c files that get compiled to objects (.o) as well. However the problem I'm facing is when linking everything together (using g++ to kick everything off). For a simple swift source file, I get a bunch of undefined symbol errors:

```
func test() {
  print(""Hello, world!"")
}
```

```

1625,2226,2019-10-18 10:34:11,2,20,"Apple rewrote many of its frameworks, daemons and applications to use `XPC` for Inter-Process-Communication. They encourage us to move away from using `sockets` or `MachMessages` as a means to provide services on our apps. And I think with good reason, the implementation and usage of `XPC` services is a pleasure to work with.

There is a difference between an `XPC` Service (capital ‘S’), which is a bundle (an entity described by a specific directory structure), and an `XPC` service (lowercase s), which is a Mach service.

`XPC` Services (`.xpc`) bundles exist inside application bundles (`.app`) or framework bundles (`.framework`) inside the `Contents/XPCServices/` directory. It can only be accessed by the application that includes the `XPC` Service bundle or and application that makes use of a framework that provides the `XPC` Service bundle.

I wrote a post describing the process of creating an app that uses an `XPC` Service. The application and the `XPC` Service were implemented using the Swift Package Manager, no need to use XCode.

I did it that way so we can better understand how everything is connected. Then when we use Xcode, all the magic won't seem so obscure. We will hopefully understand better how `XPC` Services work.If you are interested here is the link:

&amp;#x200B;

So, in the past couple of weeks I wanted to start coding, more of a side hobby at this point. I had never really programmed before, only took a small course in Python 3 years ago but I can't really remember anything at this point. I have a MacBook, so I figured I'd just start with programming in Apple's Swift and downloaded Xcode. 

At first I thought of ways how to start and get into coding/programming so I browsed some YouTube videos and ultimately found a fitting beginners tutorial by Code With Chris ([video](https://youtu.be/Ulp1Kimblg0)). It's basically a three and a half hour long tutorial video that guides you through the basics of the language. I did that for a week or so; taking notes and trying out some simple stuff in Xcode. This went from getting to know different Data Types, then on to easy If Statements, Loops, eventually Functions, Collection Types &amp; a bit of Classes. 

I then wanted to start solving tasks or exercises, so I browsed a bit and found [codewars.com](https://codewars.com). I realized that I had problems solving even the ""easy"" exercises on there because I probably still lacked a fundamental gift in code problem solving, and that while knowing the basics, I knew too little about specific commands or operators. 

At that point I started carefully reading the Swift programming language [e-book](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Functions.html) and writing out useful commands and stuff that I could use in some of these exercises. I now can solve some of these tasks, even if I'm still not fully comfortable.

Now I've found myself in kind of a weird spot. I don't know where to go, what to do and how to improve. Is pure coding too ""raw""? Do I need to do something creative in order to get forward like trying to build apps or games? Is it extremely difficult to advance without a clear goal or a mentor driving me through this kind of stuff? What can I now do that I already have ""the basics""? Is there any leading on / continuing program? 

You don't have to answer all these questions, but I'd be very thankful if you'd provide me with some answers, maybe your own experience when starting out, or could just help me in my current situation. Thanks!",I need some help with my current situation in learning Swift.

My current trajectory is to use `DateComponentsFormatter` to just spit out the number of days (`""9d""`), and then filter out the `d` string character and convert that to an `Int`.

The reason why I chose this approach is because I'm a little worried about just doing plain math on the seconds within a `TimeInterval` struct because of leap days and such, but honestly I don't need exact approximations (I don't even needs to deal with fractional days).

So my question is - is this an ok approach, or is it overkill for what I need? Below is the extension:

```swift
extension DateInterval {

    var inDays: Int? {
        let formatter = DateComponentsFormatter()
        formatter.allowedUnits = [.day]
        formatter.unitsStyle = .positional
        formatter.allowsFractionalUnits = false

        guard let dateString = formatter.string(from: duration) else { return nil }
        guard let intervalDays = Int(dateString.filter { $0 != ""d"" }) else { return nil }

        return intervalDays

I am completely new to swift, and I have a relatively simple app (hopefully simple!) that I would like to develop.  I am going through hacking with swift tutorials and apple documentation to begin my journey.  


The two things that concern me as features are the following, which I am sure I am nowhere near touching but I would like to have some information about.

\- I will need users to be able to login with a username and password, which means I assume I will have to get into server side data storage.

\-I need users to be able to send another user a message or notification.  


Everything else essentially is just storing lists or text that the user can put in the app.  I should be able to store all of this offline I would presume, however if learning cloud based storage isn't insanely complicated that might be better.  


This is my first language, and I am willing and patient with my timeframe to learn this, but I am worried that cloud based storage might take me much longer to learn if it involves Mysql or some other kind of coding.

1647,3115,2019-10-26 12:51:20,15,0,"Hi all. I'm doing project 9 of Paul Hudson's course and getting some warnings that I can't get rid of. I'm more concerned with understanding the correct way to handle the issue. I'm on the latest version of XCode which is newer than the version Paul was using at the time so I'm not sure if this is something new that might explain why he did not get warnings.

In viewDidLoad, I'm calling a method to fetch JSON data... 

    performSelector(inBackground: #selector(fetchJSON), with: nil)

In fetchJSON, I'm referencing a tabBarItem to get the tag value and that's where the warning is telling me tabBarItem must be used from the main thread only. I've tried different ways to reference it on the main thread and even tried creating a computed property to get the tabBarItem's tag value and I got the same warning on the computed property instead of the line below...

    @objc private func fetchJSON() {
        let urlString: String
        if navigationController?.tabBarItem.tag == 0 { // ***WARNING ON THIS LINE***
            urlString = ""https://www.hackingwithswift.com/samples/petitions-1.json""
        } else {
            urlString = ""https://www.hackingwithswift.com/samples/petitions-2.json""
        }
        ....
    }

I'm also getting the exact same warning in another method where I'm trying to reload the tableview and that one is really confusing me as I'm explicitly calling it on the main thread...

    tableView.performSelector(onMainThread: #selector(UITableView.reloadData), with: nil, waitUntilDone: false) // ***WARNING ON THIS LINE***

Can someone please tell me the proper way to handle this to get rid of the warnings?

I plan to use a few open source projects to build myself an app to use (VNC, RDP, ssh, mosh - because, reasons).  I hate using touch on remote machine connections and currently use Jump desktop which has Citrix X1 mouse support which works very well.

So as an effort to learn swift i chose something not too strenuous as a first go, I figured out how the Citrix X1 mouse can be used in iOS and wrote a small class which wraps up all the bluetooth stuff so that you can just get the information from the mouse easily.

Quite impressed with swift, I’ve probably made a billion rookie mistakes in my code, but up until yesterday I had never even looked at a line of swift, let alone write any!

Another bonus is this works even if your minimum deploy target is &lt; 13.0.

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\# Example

Somewhere in your view file add:

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`swift

// This if check is important if you're working with a project that supports iOS &lt; 13

// If you're working with an iOS 13+ project then you can omit the canImport(SwiftUI) check

\#if canImport(SwiftUI) &amp;&amp; DEBUG

&amp;#x200B;

import SwiftUI

&amp;#x200B;

@available(iOS 13.0, \*)

struct MyView\_Preview: PreviewProvider, UIViewPreviewProvider {



// Provide previews of your UIView

static let uiPreviews: \[Preview\] = {

&amp;#x200B;

// Create your views and populate them with some dummy data



let view1 = MyView()

view1.someProperty = ""foo""

let view1Preview = Preview(view1, displayName: ""View 1"")

&amp;#x200B;

let view2 = MyView()

view2.someProperty = ""bar""

let view2Preview = Preview(view2, displayName: ""View 2"")

&amp;#x200B;

return \[view1Preview, view2Preview\]

}()

}

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

Xcode should then render you a preview of the views you provided:

I am an average college student studying engineering. Still a sophomore so haven’t touched any programming courses yet and have no background in that field. I recently was interested in writing code because I wanted to learn a new skill for fun during my free time. I wanted to learn python because everyone says its the most widely used and my future classes will be based on python, so I wanted to get ahead. 

The problem is that I tried to self teach myself python but I do not really know what to do. I follow along with tutorials on youtube but then after the lessons I don’t know what to do with what I learned. So I end up just forgetting and getting bored very quickly. 

I have an interest for mobile app development and I feel like having this goal will force me to learn and practice. So I hear swift is the language for iOS development and I am wondering if its a good idea to learn my first language using swift and basically teaching myself (following along with youtube tutorials) as I practice building simple apps. 

Any input appreciated.

Thank you.",Complete newbie to coding. Can I start with swift and learn as I go?
1673,2255,2019-11-09 18:38:28,1,1,"I'm just trying to save a relationship in Core Data using SwiftUI.

`TodoListView`:

	struct TodoListView: View {
	    @Environment(\.managedObjectContext) var managedObjectContext
	    @FetchRequest(
	        entity: TodoList.entity(),
	        sortDescriptors: [NSSortDescriptor(key: ""order"", ascending: true)]
	    ) var todoLists: FetchedResults&lt;TodoList&gt;
	    @State var add = false
	    @State var edit = false
	    
	    var body: some View {
	        NavigationView {
	            List {
	                ForEach(todoLists, id: \.self) {todoList in
	                    NavigationLink(destination: TodoItemView(todoList: todoList), label: {
	                        Text(todoList.title!).foregroundColor(stringToColor(string: todoList.color!))
	                    })
	                }
	            }
	            ...

This creates navigation links for each todo list. The todo list is passed to the todo item view.

`TodoItemView`:

	struct TodoItemView: View {
	    @Environment(\.presentationMode) var presentationMode: Binding&lt;PresentationMode&gt;
	    @Environment(\.managedObjectContext) var managedObjectContext
	    @State var add = false
	    var todoList: TodoList
	    
	    var body: some View {
	        List {
	            ForEach(todoList.todoItems!, id: \.self) {todoItem in
	                Text(todoItem.title!)
	            }
	        }
	        .navigationBarTitle(todoList.title!)
	        .navigationBarItems(trailing:
	            HStack(spacing: 15) {
	                Button(action: {
	                    self.add = true
	                }, label: {
	                    Image(systemName: ""plus"")
	                        .imageScale(.large)
	                        .foregroundColor(todoList.color == ""None"" ? .accentColor : .primary)
	                }).sheet(isPresented: $add, content: {
	                    AddTodoItemView(todoList: self.todoList)
	                        .environment(\.managedObjectContext, self.managedObjectContext)
	                })
	                ...

This is supposed to list all of the todo items for the todo list. When you click on the plus image in the navigation bar, it loads a modal for adding a new todo item, and passes the todo list to it.

I should note that `todoList.todoItems` is set up as `@NSManaged public var todoItems: [TodoItem]?` in my `TodoList` entity class. I've also set it up as a one-to-many relationship in Core Data.

`AddTodoItemView`:

	struct AddTodoItemView: View {
	    @Environment(\.presentationMode) var presentationMode: Binding&lt;PresentationMode&gt;
	    @Environment(\.managedObjectContext) var managedObjectContext
	    @State var title = """"
	    var todoList: TodoList
	    
	    var body: some View {
	        NavigationView {
	            Form {
	                Section {
	                    TextField(""Title"", text: $title)
	                }
	                Section {
	                    Button(action: {
	                        self.save()
	                        self.presentationMode.wrappedValue.dismiss()
	                    }, label: {
	                        Text(""Save"")
	                    })
	                }
	            }
	            .navigationBarTitle(""Add Todo Item"", displayMode: .inline)
	        }
	    }
	    
	    func save() {
	        self.title = self.title.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces)
	        
	        if (self.title.count &gt; 0) {
	            let todoItem = TodoItem(context: managedObjectContext)
	            todoItem.title = self.title
	            todoItem.order = (self.todoList.todoItems?.last?.order ?? 0) + 1
	            todoList.addToTodoItems(todoItem)
	            
	            do {
	                try self.managedObjectContext.save()
	            } catch {
	                print(error)
	            }
	        }
	    }
	    ...

The `save()` function here is what causes the error and crashes the app. 

I'm not sure I'm doing this correctly. Is this the right way to list and save a relationship? All I want to do is add the new todo item to the todo list. I'm having a hard time grasping working with relationships in SwiftUI.

Here is the complete result of `print(error)`:

    func clearPin () {

            YearDigit3Label.textColor = resetColor
            YearDigit4Label.textColor = resetColor
        }

I was thinking it would be great if there was a feature in swift that let me take one value and apply it automatically to multiple elements.  I assume there is but don't know what it is.  Here's my broken pseudo code.  

    func clearPinImproved () {
            
            [pin[0],pin[2],pin[3],pin[4]] = 0

            [YearDigit1Label.textColor,YearDigit2Label.textColor,YearDigit3Label.textColor,YearDigit4Label.textColor] = resetColor
        }

Realized this was actually less readable, so I tried breaking it out like this:

    func resetPinArray () {
            for index in 0...3 {
                pin[index] = 0
            }
        }
        
        func resetYearLabels (Labels:[UILabel]) {
            for label in Labels {
                label.text = resetString
                label.textColor = resetColor
            }
        }
        
        func clearPin () {
            
            resetPinArray()
            resetYearLabels (Labels: [YearDigit1Label, YearDigit2Label, YearDigit3Label, YearDigit4Label])
        }

I’m working through a book called “Coding iPhone Apps for Kids.” It is a bit old and some of the code is out of date, but the swift playground environment has been pretty good at picking up mistakes and quickly fixing issues.

func invite(allGuests: [String]){
    for guest in allGuests {

The playground sends back an error indicating that it expects allGuests in the input parameter of 

Invite(guests: guests) 

When I let the software fix the code it changes it to invite(allGuests: [guests]) which also doesn’t work.

Not sure if the book is wrong or I’m doing something wrong. I started by changing the function names and parameters because it helps me learn better. When I face issues I literally copy it from the book and that helps me spot my errors. However; that hasn’t helped here and I’m still getting an error message.

Hey all,

Sorry if this has been asked before and I hope its the correct sub but I'm struggling to find the answer...

I'm a xamarin /xamarin forms developer and have been for about 4 years. I am about to start a 7 month project to replatform to swift and kotlin (finally).  I am pretty up to date with swift and iOS mobile platform itself (to be fair was pretty easy swap from xamarin). The only thing I don't really understand still is if swift UI or storyboards is the way to go. I think this probably stems from me being so used to hacking around everything in xamarin I don't know what nice app development looks like :D.

My app is a reasonably sized and used production app (300k month users) and it's supported by a pretty customised rest api that takes care of MOST of my business logic. Therefore the current xamarin app and the new swift app are pretty lightweight front ends and the app is mainly there for cool iOS specific features. Included in the app are thing like error logging, tagging, push notifcations and many 3rd party libraries used for all different manner of things. It's also very important that unit testing is done to a sufficent level as code quality is a real driving force for this new app (xamarin is a buggy mess at times and really hard to test). ( and ofc UI tests)

With all that in mind is Swift UI something that would be viable or is it worth just going back and using storyboards and VCs? I have had exposure to both and I actually think swfit UI works pretty well and correct me if im wrong but apple seem to be pushing it going forwards? (its even the default when you create a new app in xcode).

1. Introduction to the language - Talks about how it came into fruition and a brief explanation of what it is and how it gets used.
1. Code example - Here is provided with a small code example just to give the reader a taste of the language's syntax and features.
1. Use cases cover one or more of the following: types of developers that use it, what industries use it, what platforms and project examples.
1. Did you know is a dumping ground for some interesting facts about the language.

    ## Swift
    
    &gt; ""We are willing to make the internal implementation of Swift complex if that means that we get a beautiful model for programmers -- one that preserves the virtues of safety-by-default, predictability, performance, and joy-to-develop-in.""
    &gt;
    &gt; -- Chris Lattner - Main author of Swift
    
    ---
    
    ### Language introduction
    
    Swift is an open source language that was originally developed by Apple in 2014. They encourage the use of Swift over the existing Objective-C programming language that used to be the standard for development on their own platforms.
    
    Swift takes inspiration/incorporates aspects of Python, Rust and Ruby. A strong positive of Swift is it can be quite friendly to new programmers who want to get up and running, and due to being open for all it's acquired a large supportive community.
    
    ### Code example
    
    In this code example we will have a list of potential prizes, with the chance of not winning anything. I mean the odds look pretty good. We will randomly choose one of the five possibilities. We'll then get a friendly person to announce what has been won.
    
    ```swift
    import Foundation
    
    let IPHONE = ""iphone""
    let IPAD = ""ipad""
    let MACBOOK = ""macbook""
    let IMAC = ""imac""
    let NOTHING = ""nothing""
    
    let prizes: [String] = [IPHONE, IPAD, MACBOOK, IMAC, NOTHING];
    
    func pickRandomPrize(prizes: Array&lt;String&gt;) -&gt; String {
        let randomPrize: String = prizes.randomElement()!
        return randomPrize
    }
    
    class PrizeAnnouncer {
        let prizeWon: String;
        init(prizeWon: String) {
            self.prizeWon = prizeWon
        }
        func announce() {
            if prizeWon == NOTHING {
                return print(""You've won... nothing"")
            }
    
            print(""Congratulations! You've won a \(prizeWon)"")
        }
    }
    
    let randomPrize = pickRandomPrize(prizes: prizes)
    let announcer = PrizeAnnouncer(prizeWon: randomPrize)
    announcer.announce()
    ```
    
    Here is the result of running it five times.
    
    ```txt
    OUTPUT:
    You have won... nothing
    Congratulations! You have won a iphone
    Congratulations! You have won a ipad
    You have won... nothing
    Congratulations! You have won a imac
    ```
    
    Not bad going, eh? (Wink face)
    
    ### Use cases
    
    Swift will be used by Mobile and App developers of the Apple platforms. They will usually use XCode (The software used to write code and emulate the apps on Apple devices).
    
    Swift will be the go-to language for any Apple software engineer for the following platforms:
    
    - iOS for Mobile Development
    - macOS for Desktop Development
    - watchOS for Smartwatch Development
    - tvOS for TV Development
    
    ### Did you know
    
    Swift was developed for 4 years in secrecy, so no-one outside of Apple knew about it during such time... That's trust right there.",Review my small chapter on Swift (Go easy!)

1701,1997,2019-11-24 22:46:29,3,1,"Newbie to swift here, I have a collection view that is displaying cells based on the items I have in a Core Data stack. The issue I'm having is when I go to add a new item to the core data list, it doesn't display. I have a Tableview that takes in the data and a button that saves it, but it doesn't display when the save button is pressed. The Tableview that is adding the data is modally presented, so the collection view doesn't disappear when items are added, just the modal view is presented on top. If I switch it from modal to a normal segue, it seems to work, but I think it's due to the fact that I have \`self.collectionview.reloadData()\` in my viewDidLoad of the collectionview. 

My question is: How do I get the Collectionview to show the new item after the tableview is dismissed? The code I have is below:

    npc.profession = npcProfessionText.text
    npc.location = npcLocationText.text
    npc.imageName = npcImageView.image?.pngData()
    
    do {
    try context.save()
    } catch {
    print (""Could not save. \(error), (error.localizedDescription)"")
    }
    
    
    self.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    
    }

**Collectionview viewDidLoad code:**

    override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    
    navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = editButtonItem
    
    self.navigationController?.navigationBar.prefersLargeTitles = true

1709,1989,2019-11-28 16:57:20,0,1,"I've been working through the projects in Hacking with Swift and the further I progress, the more I start to question the actual quality the site provides.

The most recent example I found is in Project 22: Detect-a-Beacon. I noticed that the project was using a couple of deprecated methods, so once I finished with the project I wanted to find out the better way of implementing these features. After reading through Apple's documentation, it's apparent that the author of the project didn't know what he was doing and simply threw some code in an app until it worked.

Don't believe me? Start with his copy of the project found [here](https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift/tree/master/Classic/project22). Then locate the following two lines in [ViewController.swift](https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift/blob/master/Classic/project22/Project22/ViewController.swift#L41) and comment out line 41 and then run it. Notice it still works?

    41    locationManager?.startMonitoring(for: beaconRegion)
    42    locationManager?.startRangingBeacons(in: beaconRegion)

startMonitoring should be used to detect when the device is in a region, and then once you are in a region turn on ranging. Then when you leave the region, turn off ranging again.

And just in general, where are the best practices? Almost all the code is going in one class. And, on the few instances where there is code elsewhere, they are tightly coupled where one class uses [internal data structures of another class](https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift/blob/master/Classic/project14/Project14/GameScene.swift#L69)! There are magic numbers everywhere when he could pull them using code like `self.size`.

Hacking with Swift does help expose new users to a variety of Swift and iOS technologies, which is good; but, it comes off as being expert without actually being one. Normally, I wouldn't have a problem with it, but the site is also charging money for more ""advanced"" topics and it doesn't even get the basics right.

I am just beginning to use swift and I have in mind a project that is related with a web app that I usually use and is a Javascript app that involves MIDI data. That web app reads the MIDI messages that the user sends though a keyboard or some other device, and this is only possible in iOS through ""Web MIDI browser"" because Safari, Chrome, or the rest of the browsers don't support this.

My project idea is just to create a UI to populate elements/objects that give the user info about different songs and, if they click on one of them, the Web MIDI browser would have to appear loading the specified address.

My understanding is that this is not possible but I wanted to ask and see if there is a way to achieve what I want.

Thank you.",Is it possible to establish a specific web browser to be used with your app?

What I'm trying to do, is have multiple cells get selected, and then hit a trash can button to delete the selected items. I'm running into two problems:

   1. If I select multiple objects then hit my delete button- then it remove some but not all of the objects. 

   2. If I hit my edit button and select a couple of objects then hit cancel, then go back into edit mode, some objects are selected again.

My edit code is here: 

    override func setEditing(_ editing: Bool, animated: Bool) {

                let cell = collectionView.cellForItem(at: indexPath) as! CollectionViewCell
                cell.isInEditingMode = editing
            }
    
        }

and my delete button code is here:

    if let selectedCells = collectionView.indexPathsForSelectedItems {
                for indexPath in selectedCells {
                    if let items = dataSource.itemIdentifier(for: indexPath) {

I'm trying to create a macOS CLI tool with the possibility of adding on a GUI in the future. It's along the same lines as [AutoPkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg), which is an application to repackage software for different types of distribution. Basically it runs a series of steps known as processors that perform functions such as downloading a file, creating a `pkg`file of some resource, etc. These processors are chained together into recipes that produce some final output. AutoPkg is written in python, so its easy for people to supply their own custom processors by supplying a python file. 

My question is how would I accomplish something similar in swift? Ideally all the user would have to do is put a swift file into some Extensions directory. I realize that this won't be 100% safe, as there is no way to guarantee that the extension won't crash, however I think that's fine in this case.

I did some research and this might be a swiftUI bug; *correct me if I am wrong*. If I am right, I think it's unacceptable. I know half of you will say that swiftUI is still new; however, we are talking about one of the principal components of the framework here **NavigationLinks** (something probably every swiftUI app with a list will need). I don't think they get a free pass to release broken frameworks — end rant.

**PROBLEM :**  

When I tap on the row I want. I get the tableview warning bug (**\[TableView\] Warning once only: UITableView was told to layout its visible cells and other contents...**) This was something that started happening in iOS 13.1 —even using UIKIT when using the NSDiffableDataSource API— but when using storyboards it could be resolved by moving the tableview snapshot out of the viewDidLoad and into the viewDidAppear. It could also just be ignored if wanted (though I do not know the consequences of doing so, I just read that other devs were just ignoring). 

Anyway, besides getting that warning; **and here is the major problem...** the new view appears on screen modally and then pops back to the root. I've tried everything including loading the app on a physical device and am still getting this problem. Sometimes it even seems to be caught in a cycle where it gets presenting and popping repeatedly. 

If this is a swiftUI bug then I am upset because I will need to redo my whole app in UIKIT and I have a two week deadline.

If I am doing something wrong or anyone has a solution please let me know. Here is my code below for the area giving me the problems. The AppDelegate &amp; SceneDelegate files are the default ones.

Chipmunk is a very nice lightweight 2D physics engine implemented in pure C.  The code footprint is pretty small and there's nothing fancy about the build, so I found it convenient to just package the sources as a C-language target in a Swift package to make it a bit easier to use in SPM projects.

This should make it really easy to include Chipmunk in any Swift project, for instance an iOS or macOS game, without dealing with system modules or building and importing a separate dylib.

1774,464,2020-01-04 23:10:29,0,0,"Heya this might be a dumb question, but I’m looking for some advice about trying to access some data `HMCharacteristicProperty` on a HomeKit enabled humidity sensor (Onvis SMS1)

The sensor collects a month’s worth of historic data and the manufacturer’s app plots the points on an axis against time. The manufacturer’s app is really not great and this data often doesn’t display properly. I discovered that the data is shared via HomeKit as a characteristic, but it’s Data type and I don’t know how the data was encoded. 

There’s a `Humidity_Today_Data` characteristic and a `Humidity_History_Data` characteristic with 16 and 750 bytes respectively which aligns with what I would expect based on the manufacturer’s app functions. 

Realistically I figure I might be out of luck given I don’t know how the data was structured but considering the fairly simple type of information that’s being stored here I’m hoping someone might have some tips for common patterns that I might try for decoding this?

1775,463,2020-01-05 20:37:06,2,1,"Hi all,

As the title states I'm having issues with getting assistant editor to pull the proper class. Currently my View Controller has a class called SearchViewController which loads fine, but within my VC I have a Collection View with a class called ExploreCollectionViewCell. However when I select the Collection View in the document outline, assistant editor does not pull the proper swift file. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I select Automatic my only options are SearchViewController &amp; UIResponder.h. I am able to Option + click on the ExploreCollectionViewCell.swift file and manually create an IBOutlet and drag to the UIImageView that is on the collection view cell but not from the storyboard or document outline.

&amp;#x200B;

To troubleshoot I've removed the reference to ExploreCollectionViewCell and added it back. Completely deleted the collection view and set everything back up from scratch. Restarted Xcode and my computer.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there something that I'm missing or overlooking? I've added the project to Github and it can be found [here](https://github.com/PrinceThunderChunky/InstagramApp)

&amp;#x200B;

Also the error states 

`2020-01-05 12:30:37.016153-0800 InstagramApp[5768:106175] [Storyboard] Unknown class ExploreCollectionViewCell in Interface Builder file.`

The decoder apparently is particular about what characters can exist in the id, as I figured I just put in a 5-digit unique code for each, but the JSONDecoder function fails.

So my question is, how can I manage to keep my struct ""Identifiable"" by using something like UUID, without having to literally generate unique strings for every JSON object outside of my app?

    struct CartItem : Codable, Equatable, Identifiable {

            quantity = ""1 EA""

    	""quantity"": ""1 Each""

This JSON does not:

    [
        {

            ""name"": ""5-Lead Electrode"",
    	""size"": """",
    	""quantity"": ""1 Each""
        }
    ]	

Problem is that I manually borrowed that ID string from one of Paul's example projects. But I cannot figure out the logic of why it's needed if I'm using UUID, or where I can generate say ID strings as needed if I'm stuck doing so.

FOR REFERENCE:

Here's the Helper.swift script:

Anyway, I've been tempted to learn JavaScript in order to have another stack in my tool belt. Also, because everywhere I go everyone I meet is a web developer. I know Basic (learnt it in college and applied it at my last job extensively but haven't used it since I changed jobs:  Analyst -&gt; Graphic Designer). 

I'm a little nervous about learning another language. I know this might sound silly but I feel that I'll forget swift somehow :D maybe because I don't code anything in VB since leaving my last job 2 years ago, and even my Bash skills have evaporated since I haven't used that since I was a teenie... I don't want this to happen to my swift! 

Do you think I should just continue learning Swift and making things, or should I start diversifying? I feel a bit overwhelmed even with swift. The current app I'm working on uses so many frameworks and I find myself going down rabbit holes learning new stuff. I also feel that SQL is looming over me...

Now I know `onTapGesture` and `onAppear` exists but they don't seem to work for me. `onAppear` will always update the `foodDetail` var with nutrient info of the last row in the list and `onTap` will actually run the function but it doesn't transition to the FoodDetailView which shows the nutrient details

I want to make the buttons turn on z axis whilst changing its value. I have tried many things to get this and I am not getting the desired behaviour. The closest I get is the spin animation appearing when shuffle keeps all buttons the same (most visible when there is only one button in one array) but otherwise no animation. I cannot animate the buttons with a custom animation if they are shuffled - swiftui seems to want to do the sliding around animation or nothing.

Let me explain.

When I finish a project (2-3 days of the 100 days), I go back and attempt to redo the project from scratch. That way, I'm not only making sure I comprehend the material, but that I can actually remember it to use in the future.

I started doing this so I can comfortably feel like I'm retaining the material. But that has turned 100 days into more like 150-200 days.

I'm suspecting that the memorizing aspect is not nearly as important as comprehension. We do have Google, after all. But maybe I'm choosing a better way to learn the material.

I'm considering running through the material a TON faster and just making sure I understand how to make the code work, without worrying about being able to recreate projects from memory/scratch.

What do you all think? Is there a more effective and efficient approach to going through the 100 Days of Swift, or Swift learning in general?",Critique my Swift learning approach
1849,2204,2020-02-10 21:01:56,4,1,"Let’s say I have this error JSON metadata I get back from my server:

```
// Super class/Base class
public class ErrorInfo: Decodable {
    public let alertTitle: String
    public let alertMessage: String
    public let exception: String

    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case alertTitle, alertMessage, exception
    }

    required public init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        alertTitle = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .alertTitle)
        alertMessage = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .alertMessage)
        exception = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .exception)
    }
}

// Subclass, only happens when requesting a specific endpoint
public class UpdateUserErrorInfo: ErrorInfo {
    public let invalidField: String
    public let invalidValue: String

    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case invalidField, invalidValue
    }

    required public init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        self.invalidField = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .invalidField)
        self.invalidValue = try container.decode(String.self, forKey: .invalidValue)
        try super.init(from: decoder)
    }
}
```

So in 99% of all cases what will be returned from the different endpoints is the `ErrorInfo` class, but in one case when let’s say the user is updating their profile the `UpdateUserErrorInfo` class will be returned.

Now here comes the polymorphism question. How can I in my `APIService` class make sure that the right subclass of `ErrorInfo` gets decoded without having to check if:

Is it `UpdateUserErrorInfo`, no then try
Is it `FooErrorInfo`, no then try
Is it `BarErrorInfo` no then try
Is it `ErrorInfo`

I’ve seen a case when wrapping the different subclasses and its parent class in an Enum might work but I haven’t found that particular site again. I’ve also seen cases where they have collection of a base class and different subclasses but this is not really relevant to my case.

Edit:

I found this: https://github.com/nsscreencast/305-codable-and-polymorphism/blob/master/Codable%20and%20Polymorphism.playground/Contents.swift where Ben Scheirman uses a `SearchResultWrapper` Enum. I think this might be what I’m looking for, unfortunately it requires a `kind` String to determine what class to decode.

Here's the basic idea. I want to run the app on my Macbook Pro. I have an external display plugged in too, a TV (3840x2160). I want a UI window on my laptop that allows me to drag in a picture. When I hit ""Go,"" it'll push the picture (fullscreen, I'll make sure to only drag in 3840x2160 images) to the TV. The app will stay running, and if I drag in a new picture and say ""Go"" again, it pushes the update to the TV!

This is a simplified version; After I get this working, I'd want to add a few more features (different orientations, scales, etc) but I figure if I can get the app to show a picture on the TV with a basic UI, I'll have enough to work with to where I can learn the rest!

I tried to make one file that would have all the general imports for a give project and it's not being seen.


Example:

If you have 20 .swift files and you need to add 3 import statements to each, you could add just 1 import that contains the 3 imports.

This way, as you add more frameworks, imports, etc... you just change this one file and you don't have to change each of the 20 files.

So the one file could be myGeneralImports.swift and in there, you have all the imports that you need for those files and then inside each of those files you have one single line ""import myGeneralImports"", and it's the same effect as if you had all those imports directly in each of the 20 .swift files.

I tried simply adding a .swift file and adding the imports in there, but it doesn't see it.  I get ""no such module"".

I've done the direct to Xcode from a local code set a long time ago, so I'm refreshing myself on that.  Then I started learning a bit about how to set it up as a GitHub and how to make all the files needed for Podfiles and SPM.

The tutorials seem spotty in that they only cover some things and I'm looking for something much more comprehensive.

-------------------------

I haven't gone thru all of them and I'm not clear on the road map as some don't even touch on CI.

Q1. can you safely ignore Podfiles now that SPM has been out for a while and can someone mix frameworks with Podfiles and SPM or is it one or the other and NOT both at the same time?

Q2. is there any tutorials about how to make your framework work with CI or is that an automatic thing?  Maybe a list of requirement for working with CI is what I'm looking for.

Q3. if you use GitHub instead of all local code, how do you control version in SPM and/or Podfiles?  I know Podfiles you can specify the version number, but how do you control that inside of the framework?  If you branch from one version to another in GitHub, does that automatically transfer to Podfile or SPM?  If I have ver 1 and want a ver 1.1, how do I do that, create a branch in GitHub, and then how do I tell Podfile/SPM which version is which?

Q4. if you end up with a large framework, does it cause bloat in the app or does the linker only take the parts that are actually needed?  Long ago, I used to make libraries and we were always told to make the code as granular as you can so that you don't eat up a bunch of memory when it's loaded.  Is that the case with Swift frameworks?

Q5. I'd like to make some universal code that's not swift, is there any tutorial on writing C/C++ and then calling from Swift and then from Kotlin?","Looking for a good tutorial for building a custom framework, one that gets into SPM and Podfiles."

1899,3071,2020-03-02 18:21:17,6,1,"Hey guys! So was wondering if I could get some guidance on this. I have a Google Maps API app that calls this function below to display a custom infoWindow when a marker is clicked. 

            mapView.animate(toLocation: position!)
            let point = mapView.projection.point(for: position!)
            let newPoint = mapView.projection.coordinate(for: point)
            let camera = GMSCameraUpdate.setTarget(newPoint)
            mapView.animate(with: camera)
    
            let background = UIColor.infoWindowBackground
            customInfoWindow?.layer.backgroundColor = background.cgColor
            customInfoWindow?.layer.cornerRadius = 8
            customInfoWindow?.center = mapView.projection.point(for: position!)
            customInfoWindow?.center.y -= 100
            customInfoWindow?.CustomWindowLabel.text =  point.title
            customInfoWindow?.CustomWindowSubLabel.lineBreakMode = .byWordWrapping
            customInfoWindow?.CustomWindowSubLabel.numberOfLines = 0
            ...
            mapView.addSubview(customInfoWindow!)

My original code calls this in the mapView(didTap) function and this works fine. However, when I try to open an infoWindow automatically on the app opening, it does not work. I tried this by adding the above code (with and without the mapView animation code) to the end of my viewDidLoad(). The code runs, but the app only opens the map with no infoWindow, and when I try to click on a point to open a normal infoWindow the background is gone and only the button/text shows up.

My second app -  [Tempedia: TemTem Helper](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1498405604) Any and all feedback is MUCH appreciated! I have learned so much from the people I have met here.

**In hopes of returning the favor and helping others to get started in iOS development, I thought I would share the lessons I've learned in going from zero programming experience to now:**

\-

\-

*First off, if you are just getting into it, my recommendation is to learn some programming fundamentals and if you are set on learning 'Swift', focus on 'SwiftUI'. It's easy, powerful, and fun and it's a good way to be able to learn something that you can immediately turn around and use to make an app. SwiftUI is what's called a declarative UI framework and while that may not mean anything to some of you.....you will LOVVVEEE it once you do! It makes programming and making apps easy and fun.*

***BEFORE WE START:***  
*I STRONGLY recommend that you go get a Lynda.com account as it has turned out to be my fav resource AND you can likely get an account for free if you live in the United States(maybe outside as well, maybe commenters can fill me in on that one). Most CITY(Not county) libraries include a free Lynda.com membership with your library card. The content is usually vastly better than anything you find on YouTube and it's easy to find. It isn't my favorite resource for the more advanced programming content, but it is definitely the best beginner's resource I could find.*

# WHERE TO LEARN FROM:

**Where to start -** [**Programming Foundations: Fundamentals**](https://www.lynda.com/Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Foundations-Programming-Fundamentals/83603-2.html)  
I have sifted through a TON of 'beginner' courses trying to find something of quality and honestly this is the best one I was able to happen upon. If you are coming from ABSOLUTELY ZERO programming experience, then this is an amazing place to start. It may not be 'swift specific' but it will introduce you to ESSENTIAL programming principles, terminology, and techniques.

**Where to start with Swift -** [**Swift 5 Essentials**](https://www.lynda.com/course-tutorials/Swift-5-Essential-Training/751327-2.html) **/** [**SwiftUI Essentials**](https://www.lynda.com/Swift-tutorials/SwiftUI-Essential-Training/2815125-2.html) **/** [**100 Days with SwiftUI**](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)  
You definitely need to learn some swift specific basics, so getting through [Swift 5 Essentials](https://www.lynda.com/course-tutorials/Swift-5-Essential-Training/751327-2.html) is the my recommended 'step two'. Following that and whatever style best fits you, I would recommend either following tutorials like the [SwiftUI Essentials](https://www.lynda.com/Swift-tutorials/SwiftUI-Essential-Training/2815125-2.html) or the [100 Days with SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). But for me, the most helpful thing was finding simple 'example apps' that people have made and have posted throughout the internet. I recommend looking for app examples that have something to do with what you want to make and seeing if they have an example app you can download and dissect.

# THE NEXT STEP:

Once I gained an ok amount of understanding, I found that two specific resources have been OVERWHELMINGLY more helpful than any others I could find.

**First and foremost(at least if we are talking about SwiftUI) -** [**SwiftUI-Lab.com**](https://swiftui-lab.com)  
If I could kiss this man on the lips, I would do so without hesitation. This guy made [SwiftUI-Lab.com](https://SwiftUI-Lab.com) and a MacOS app [A Companion for SwiftUI](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-companion-for-swiftui/id1485436674?mt=12), and oh I could not praise these two resources enough! The macOS app has examples of most anything you'd want to do and his website has some of the the most in depth dives into what SwiftUI can really do. I have probably gone back and read and re-read this guy's articles....oh goodness, at least 3-4 times each. As I learn and understand more, the more I am just super grateful that such an in depth resource is even available. His Mac app is admittedly a bit pricey, but I use it almost daily, even just for little stuff and I honestly don't mind paying the price because he deserves it.

**I know this might seem like a no-duh, but:** [**https://stackoverflow.com**](https://stackoverflow.com)  
Since I didn't know anything about programming, I didn't really know this site existed, but now it's practically become something I use as much as I use Google. Use it, and don't be afraid to post questions on there. Occasionally you will get someone who posts something useless like ""Go Read the Documentation""(LOL SwiftUI documentation btw is a joke), but overall the people on there make Stack Overflow an awesome place for people who want to learn. Don't forget to contribute as well, though, where and when you can.

# MY OTHER FAV RESOURCES/SOLUTIONS:

I have marked each of these resources with what I would consider their difficulty in understanding, so if you are JUST starting out, don't bother trying to read and understand the Intermediate or Advanced stuff just yet.

[**A SwiftUI CheatSheet**](https://github.com/SimpleBoilerplates/SwiftUI-Cheat-Sheet#tap) **\[Beginner\]**  
[**Frames + Transitions**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56680017/this-swiftui-animation-should-only-fade-out-why-does-it-move-to-the-right) **\[Beginner\]**  
(While I don't think that everyone will encounter this particular issue, if you can read this article and know why the behavior documented here is happening, it means you have at least an ok understanding of frames and how they might interact with transitions or animations.)   
[**Lists for Noobs**](https://daddycoding.com/2019/11/26/swiftui-list/) **\[Beginner\]**  
(Lists are really useful but at the same time are often confusing. This article explains the essentials. Just know there are some strange limitations and behaviors you will encounter. Stuff like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56576298/swiftui-two-buttons-in-a-list). Also just a heads up, buttons inside of a list can act strangely. So sometimes you need to put the 'function' of a button inside of a .onTapGesture that is attached to the 'view/label' of a button instead.)  
[**Making something 'tappable' even if it's invisible or too small**](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-control-the-tappable-area-of-a-view-using-contentshape) **\[Beginner\]**  
(If you are working with buttons or anything tappable, understanding how to use .contentShape is a MUST)  
[**Regex...thank god for regex**](https://regex101.com) **\[Beginner\]**  
(If you don't know what Regex is, go and google it now because it will be your very best friend! And this particular website is a really powerful way to use it. More importantly, this website is a really easy way to understand how to use Regex because it explains what it's doing as you do it and it provides a sort of Regex dictionary.)  
[**Interesting Post on Formatting Text Views**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59071375/swiftui-how-do-style-text-view-with-different-font-and-colour-on-string-subrang) **\[Beginner\]**  
(Text views are somewhat limited in SwiftUI as of right now, so there are things you sometimes have to do to work around these limitations. This is another one where you may not ever need the specific behavior that this post describes, but you could probably learn a thing or two just by reading and understanding the answer posted here)  
[**An...Interesting 'Transition' behavior that you WILL Encounter**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57730074/transition-animation-not-working-in-swiftui) **\[Beginner..ish\]**  
(Transitions are something that controls how a 'view' enters or leaves your display and there are some important things to know about how they behave. *This StackExchange post is a must read*)

  
[**Custom Fonts in SwiftUI**](https://www.simpleswiftguide.com/how-to-use-custom-fonts-in-swift-ios-app-using-swiftui/) **\[Intermediate\]**  
(Honestly you should just master using the built in font before going and playing elsewhere, but this if you find yourself needing a specific font, this is a useful article on how to do that)  
[**Scaling Custom Fonts**](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-use-dynamic-type-with-a-custom-font) **\[Intermediate\]**  
(As you use the built in font, you will may or may not realize that it is built to adjust automatically with the end-user's accessibility font size settings. It is a good practice to let your font do the same where possible. So if you are going to use a 'custom font', here is how to make it scalable based on the end-user's settings. [Here are a bunch of examples of people putting it into practice](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56726869/is-it-possible-to-use-dynamic-type-sizes-with-a-custom-font-in-swiftui) with some extras on making it more useable.)  
[**Understanding How Frames Work**](https://swiftui-lab.com/frame-behaviors/) **\[Intermediate\]**  
(Frames can be really confusing at first but if you carefully read though this article, it can help a ton)  
[**How to hide the Keyboard in SwiftUI**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56491386/how-to-hide-keyboard-when-using-swiftui) **\[Intermediate\]**  
(This is surprisingly not something that was built into swiftUI and has to be taken care of in sort of a janky way, it isn't perfect and it may not be the right solution for what you might need, but it's a starting point)  
[**Lists freezing or Transitions not triggering?**](https://swiftui-lab.com/swiftui-id/) **\[Intermediate\]**  
(SwiftUI isn't perfect and Lists and Transitions are one of the prime examples of this. There ARE workarounds, though and this article is really quite useful in that department)  
[**Email PopupView**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56784722/swiftui-send-email) **\[Intermediate\]**  
(Make sure you read past the 'marked' answer on this one...and on like all Stackexchange posts)  
[**Animations for Intermediates**](https://www.raywenderlich.com/5815412-getting-started-with-swiftui-animations) **\[Intermediate\]**

  
[**Multi-Threading**](https://hackernoon.com/swift-multi-threading-using-gcd-for-beginners-2581b7aa21cb) **\[Advanced\]**   
(When your app needs to be doing more than one thing or maybe be doing something in the background. This can be somewhat complicated and easy to mess up/cause unexpected problems, so just experiment and tread slowly though this one.)  
[**Advanced Animations: In Depth**](https://swiftui-lab.com/category/animations/) **\[Advanced\]**  
(A set of 3 SwiftUI-Lab articles that anyone wanting to do animations in SwiftUI MUST read...and then come back and re-read...many times)  
[**Advanced Animations: Shake Effect**](https://www.objc.io/blog/2019/10/01/swiftui-shake-animation/) **\[Advanced\]**  
(This specific animation may not be the exact thing you use in your app, but knowing that this can be done and how to do it has been actually very helpful. So I recommend this read)

Hey guys,

1913,2172,2020-03-07 21:57:09,41,1,"I'm shocked! 

A year ago, I was sitting around the kitchen table talking to my brother and telling him that I wanted to learn how to code. 

That same night, I signed up for Lynda.com ... After a month I gave up... I don't even remember why. All I know is that from the videos I watched I didn't feel confident enough to build anything. Everything felt jumbled.

A month went buy and I decided to download [https://books.apple.com/us/book/app-development-with-swift/id1465002990](https://books.apple.com/us/book/app-development-with-swift/id1465002990) ... I cannot express how much this book helped me consolidate the core concepts of Swift and Object Oriented Programming (OOP). 

I'm not going to lie; I've always been interested in coding—ever since the Myspace days. However, other than some VB projects, light CSS, and HTML; I had never actually invested enough time to get past the first hurdle of just understanding OOP. I purchased books and would never actually read past the first few chapters (PHP, JAVA, LINUX Kernals). Ironically, I still have the Java book and to my surprise I actually understand it now. 

I remember going through these book and feeling overwhelmed by concepts. This was not the feeling the Apple book gave me. When I finished it I felt confident enough to start my own little projects and use YouTube and stack overflow to find answers when I became stuck.

I watched some coding videos from Sean Allen and thought to myself that I would never have code like that (Funny enough it was just basic stuff still). 

It's crazy, that was only a few months ago. I now have several projects, an app on the App Store, and what I feel, is an in-depth understanding of OOP. I've started implementing BDD, and writing code that is less dependent on specific types and easier to write unit tests for. 

I never thought I'd be able to write something like the class below, especially without using external references but I can now do it. 

So, I just wanted to share this post in case there's someone out there who is worried that they won't be able to learn this stuff. I'm here to tell you that you can. All you need to do is invest time. I literally have spent the last year writing code or reading about swift for about 12hr a day after work. 

Today, I started a new chapter in my programming career. I downloaded Visual Studio Code and started learning Javascript so that I can write my own template file for my website and ditch the $80 Shopify monthly subscription I currently am paying.

I'm also looking for a job and am open to relocating if anyone here is an employer.

I'm instantiating the networkManager in View Controller 1, then I push a view controller, VC2, through the navigation controller. VC2 has an init too, but instead of instantiating a new network manager, I transfer the first one.

The init Code for both view controllers:
```
init(networkManager: AuthNetworkManager) {
        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
        self.networkManager = networkManager
    }
```
The instantiation happens in the AppDelegate.swift:
```
@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    var window: UIWindow?
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -&gt; Bool {
        window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)
        window!.rootViewController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: LoginViewController(networkManager: AuthNetworkManager()))
        window!.makeKeyAndVisible()
        return true
    }
}
```
LoginViewController is VC1. When I push from VC1 to VC2, there is a performance degradation (I think based on visual effects). This is how I'm pushing:
```
 self.navigationController?.pushViewController(ViewController(networkManager: self.networkManager), animated: true)
```
Why is there this performance degradation? **WHAT SHOULD I ACTUALLY DO?**. Even then, it takes about 1 second to send the first network request.

1928,2158,2020-03-10 13:14:22,27,1,"Let's say I have a scenario (which is very common in programming) with the need to:

1. Provide common code for a set of children classes
2. Some implementation is left for the children classes to fill out
3. The implementation detail and properties inside the common code should be kept private to the inherited classes

You can't actually do this in swift from my research.

In most other programming languages, this would be a simple Abstract Class, with ""Protected"" access to concrete implementation in the abstract class. 

Here's the closest I can come up with in swift:

    public protocol CDViewModel: class {
        var cancellableList: [AnyCancellable] { get set }
    }
    public extension CDViewModel {
       func subscribe(_ callback: @escaping (Project) -&gt; Void) {
        cancellableList.append( /*...*/)
      }
    }

And then child class

    class MyClass: CDViewModel {
        private var cancellableList: [AnyCancellable] = [AnyCancellable]()  //error
    }

with error

    Property 'cancellableList' must be declared public because it matches a requirement in public protocol 'CDViewModel'

The real issue here is that **Protocols in swift does not allow for private properties.**

1942,3458,2020-03-17 09:22:06,16,1,"Hello Swift lovers!

I implemented a Swift library with a dedicated command-line tool. It's meant for to Swift programmers as well as Mac admins. Its purpose is to make specific data format parsing simple when the data structure is not known at build time. It was inspired by [SwiftyJson](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON), while using a slightly different approach and trying to cover more ground like Plist and Xml.

So I’m proud to present **Scout**, available on [Github](https://github.com/ABridoux/scout). It’s a swift library with a command line tool. It’s the same library as the one used in [Octory](https://www.octory.io) to parse API call responses. And it’s now **open-source**. To give some insight, here is how it could be used to parse the following Json.

    {
      ""people"": {
        ""Tom"": {
          ""height"": 175,
          ""age"": 68,
          ""hobbies"": [
            ""cooking"",
            ""guitar""
          ]
        },
        ""Arnaud"": {
          ""height"": 181,
          ""age"": 23,
          ""hobbies"": [
            ""video games"",
            ""party"",
            ""tennis""
          ]
        }
      }
    }

Swift

    let json = try PathExplorerFactory.make(Json.self, from: data)
    
    // output 175
    try json.get(""people"", ""Tom"", ""height"").int // output 175
    
    //  will change Arnaud first hobby from ""video games"" to ""football""
    try json.set(""people"", ""Arnaud"", ""hobbies"",  0, to: ""football"")

If the same file was a Plist, you would only have to change one line:

    let plist = try PathExplorerFactory.make(Plist.self, from: data)

Bash

    # output 175
    scout ""people-&gt;Tom-&gt;height""
    # modify Tom first hobby from ""cooking"" to ""football""
    scout set ""people-&gt;Tom-&gt;hobbies-&gt;[0]:football""

I hope you will find it useful! More detailed instructions on how to use it and download it are available on the [Github](https://github.com/ABridoux/scout). It's still in development so some bugs may occur. Feel free to [report them](https://github.com/ABridoux/scout/issues) if any.

Be safe.

I have a protocol called `Event` and a LOT of structs that implement `Event`, for example `UserCreated` and `PostPublished`. Now I want to store all those events in a dictionary and I want to use the type of each event as the dictionary key. That way I can find a particular event without needing for loop through an entire list to find the right one.

Right now all I can think of is to do:

```swift
var dict = [String:Event]()
let event = UserCreated(name: ""John"")
dict[""\(type(of: event))""] = event
```

But I wonder if there’s a better way than to just cast the type of the event to a string.

I saw [a post on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42459639/1498652) where someone made a struct called `HashableType&lt;T&gt;: Hashable` which sounded like it was exactly what I was looking for.

However, when I try it, it seems to only work if `&lt;T&gt;` is a base class that other classes extend from, rather than a protocol that are classes or structs implement.

So I’m basically looking for a solution like that, that works for protocols and their implementations.

But you can imagine that googling for “hashable type” doesn’t really help, because then you just get all the articles about the `Hashable` protocol.

The app is only used by employees of a smallish-medium sized company and their clients. Basically, the app displays new delivery schedules each day; the delivery schedules are finalised 2 days prior to being displayed on the app.

Due to the number of users, my client's budgetary restrictions and the density of some files, I'm facing issues with throttling, so to resolve this, I plan to add a button to the HomeScreen, called showButton.  


Say today is Day 1 of the app being available. To display the schedule of Day 1, user has to press showButton.  


What I want for to happen is that, when he presses showButton 2 things happen:

1. Delivery schedule of day 1 is displayed
2. At the same time, delivery schedule of Day 2 is downloaded and cached in the user's device. 
3. One Day 2, when the user presses showButton again, the previous day's cached file is displayed, and Day 3's delivery schedules are cached, so on and so forth.  


Im counting on the fact that different users will press the button at different times during the day, so as to resolve the throttling issue

I really like the simplicity of Koin due to it simply using functional programming to resolve dependencies, where as dagger uses reflection which is a bit heavy in memory usage. We used swinject in our company of 1000+ people and eventually I figured it's a bit opinionated with a lot more boilerplate than necessary.

I checked out the rest of the competition in terms of DI for Swift and [Resolver](https://github.com/hmlongco/Resolver) one stood out to me the most. It's actually a very powerful library but the way it handles argument specific injections is not very straight forward. It has a lot more features than mine but I'm planning to add some more later on.

Please check out my library, I'm planning to use it in many of my projects moving forward and hopefully it will grow with them. I'm looking for some usage and would love to see how the Swift community thinks of this and I am willing to update this framework to make sure everyone's requirements are satisfied.

I'm learning swift with an iphone app, and one of the things that I keep messing up with, is knowing when there are to be spaces around somethings and not others.

I solved it in the first go around with much longer code basically spelling it all out. cool. But now I am trying to make efficient code and running into a hiccup that I'm not understanding why it won't work.

&amp;#x200B;

I've got 2 experts:

    let expertA = Expert()
    let expertB = Expert()

And I've got 2 functions:

    func move(distance: Int) {
        for i in 1...distance {

                Expert().turnLockDown()

    expertA.move(distance: 3)
    expertB.turnLock(up: true, numberOfTimes: 2)

**The .moveForward() and the .turnLockUp functions work perfect, but the .collectGem() \[inside the move function\] is not happening. Is there a reason this won't connect?**

1993,496,2020-04-10 22:22:24,0,1,"I've inherited a SwiftUI codebase and am attempting to write some UITests for it. 

Now, I'm still catching up to speed with writing Swift and SwiftUI code, so I'm not sure of the legitimacy of the design pattern being utilized. There's essentially an initial view, that starts with an initial `@State` and begins to pass it down from there into later view through the `@Binding` tag.

Due to Swift's UI testing requiring an Accessibility label, the button below is causing me a bit of a headache. For a handful of views, there is only ever one `BottomTextButton` with the content within it dynamically changing based on the case statement and the view we are viewing.

&lt;!-- language: swift --&gt;

    HStack(alignment: .top) {

            if self.loginSignupScreen == .logIn {

                    loginSignupScreen: $loginSignupScreen,
                    bottomTextButton: $bottomTextButton,
                    loggedIn: $loggedIn,
                    transitonBackward: $transitonBackward
                )} else if self.loginSignupScreen == .signUp {
                    SignUpView(
                        loginSignupScreen: $loginSignupScreen, 
                        bottomTextButton: $bottomTextButton, 
                        signUpCTA: $signUpCTA, 
                        transitonBackward: $transitonBackward
                    )}
                }
            }

    VStack {

            transitonBackward: $transitonBackward,
            buttonAccessibilityLabel: $buttonAccessibilityLabel
        )
    }

    return movieCell
    }
    }

I would expect that when the app is run that movieTitle and movieReleaseDate are passed from the detail view controller and input into the library table cell, this is initiated by tapping a button on the detail view controller.

However this seems to have no affect on the program or simply returns blank cells. No errors are reported in console nor does the app crash

I have tried sending the data to the variables movieTitle and movieRelease and setting NumberOfRowsInSection to 1 but this returns nil

I receive an error: Value of type View Controller has no member libMovie  
DestViewController.libMovie.title = movieTitle

DestViewcontorller.datasource also produces and error -&gt; Cannot assign value of type 'String?' to type '\[libMovie\]'",Passing Data into UITableView

At the moment, I am working on the Sign Up view, where I input user data to test signing up a user. I am unsure of how I am supposed to manage the data here - when I click the signup button, this will hit my API and sign a user up. But, the next time I run the test, the sign up will fail due to attempting to sign up with the exact same data.

My initial assumption is that I need to spin up a temporary database so that I am properly hitting these endpoints and creating a User and when the tests are finished, the database disappears.

The UI tests are being automated through Github Actions. Is there a way to containerize and manage this there?",How do I manage data while UI Testing?

Now the app isn't writing to the DB at all. My completion handler comes back with a **success** but when I log into the aws console I do not see any new entries to the DB.

I used docker to check if my GraphQL schema worked properly and everything seems to work fine there as far as mutations and queries.

This app isn't important. Honestly, I am just trying to learn AWS. I will paste the class that handles the CRUD on dynamoDB along with a link to the repo. If anyone has any idea what's happening it would be greatly appreciated.

I have a variable (gemCount) set to 0, gemCount will increase in value as the code runs in a while loop.

I understand what the sentence means, but if I change it to say genCount != 1 or gemCount &amp;lt; 1, there are no errors whilst both of the changed Boolean are … well … Booleans based on integer variables.

I've been googling this for hours and have tried many variations of ObservedObject, EnvironmentObject, Published, State, etc but I am unable to find a solution. It's probably a pretty easy fix but honestly I don't know where to begin.

Basically I'm trying to make a calculator app but I can't pass the output expressions from the Calculate class to the TextView struct. I want to pass the variables topOutput and bottomOutput to TextView. The initial values """" and ""0"" are successfully passed, but when these two variables are updated later in the Calculate class, the TextView is not updated.

Hi everyone! I am very new to programming. Sorry if the format isn't right.

I had the code below working just fine before I added a simple textview in one of the VStacks inside the NavigationView. Then the error showed up next to the Form. But even if I delete what I added, the error wouldn't go away. Then I tried to delete the Form. It moved to the navigationview. I am completely stumped.

I searched in Stackoverflow, swift.org, medium. The results are not really related to VStack. So I don't know how to add return type to a Form. I am sure I did something wrong there but just couldn't figure it out.

I'm reasonably comfortable with coding (javascript/C#) but have never done anything with Swift or developed anything on iOS/MacOS. Now trying to dip my toes into these waters and just reading up swift. A lot of things are still unclear and XCode feels much harder than VS Code - but it's a matter of getting used to I guess.

I want to develop a fairly straightforward MacOS desktop app. The app would have a left pane to show some folders and files, and when they click a file, the right pane would show some stuff after text processing the file. It's nothing terribly fancy, but will need some solid file management, text/regex processing, a good settings screen with lots of options, and then run a console/terminal program.

I'm hoping to learn from a reasonably simple desktop app sample project but don't know which one would be good - there's a lot of iOS or really complicated apps not good for a total n00b.

Are there are any good sample projects for MacOS with some characteristics of the above, and any good video tutorials? At this point, I don't even know how to connect the UI to the code... so I'm really that early. I am reading a ton - there's just a lot.

1.- Almost every link I open is focused on Ios

2.- When they're not, they show a really old version of xCode / osX (when the play button was rectangular)

3.- A lot of information/tutorials show old code which doesn't work anymore.

Hi,

I need some guidances. I am building an app, to put in practice what a learn in swift. The app  has 2 tab bars. On the first one, the user add a game by entering data about the game(win or lost, goals scored for him and opponent, corners etc). When he adds a game, it will be save on the database using Core data. He can see all added game on table view. When the user clicks on the end button, the session will end, i remove all elements inside the data source and reload the table view, so it will be empty for the next session of games. 

On the second tab bar i am  appending an  arrayoFArrayOfGames  with all added games from the first tab. And using a tableview to  go trough this arrayOfArray to show a summary of stats per session(how many wins &amp; lost per session, shots, goals, goal concede, etc .....)

 The way it is right now, i have one class with different attributes (win, goal concede, goal scored etc..). I am using it to save and persist everything until pressing the end button. Since i am removing all items and delete those items in order to show an empty tableview on the first tab bar but at the same time i need to append my arrayOfArrayOfGames with those games. I am wondering how should i model the database. Should i create a second table with same attributes and make a copy of all added games from the first tab and use it on the second tab bar. But at the same time is it possible to get an arrayOfArray with core data ?

Thanks

2029,3253,2020-04-22 05:48:07,9,1,"I am creating a Swift Package that has C sources. To see the project structure, I am basically (kind of) following this setup: [https://oleb.net/blog/2017/12/importing-c-library-into-swift/](https://oleb.net/blog/2017/12/importing-c-library-into-swift/) but with a different library.

Long story short: I am getting things done, but I feel like there might be better ways I am unaware of. I will write down some questions I have. Any documents / tutorials that are slightly related will help, thanks! 

What ends up happening is that it looks like I have C code inline with my Swift. I end up calling C functions that need UnsafeRawPointers.

\`let foo = some\_c\_method(UnsafeRawPointer(&amp;**bar**))\`

This gives a warning: Initialization of 'UnsafeRawPointer' results in a dangling pointer.

Also, I have yet to work with c-structs, so I'm not sure how to represent those in swift. Lastly, what about functions that return pointers? How do I dereference the results to get a swift struct?

Many people have probably made something like this already but this is my shot at it. I am also looking for some code review or hints on how to make the code better. Particularly: there's two sections of code I had to just had to repeat and couldn't find any way around repeating it.

If you ask for it I'll try to add a some more customization options.

`GridView`s can be either row based or column based. Row based grids get filled row by row, and column based grids get filled column by column. To layout cells properly: `GridView`s need to have a GeometryReader ancestor that's the same size as the parent view.

&amp;#x200B;

[Row based grid](https://preview.redd.it/351vgipzegu41.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8148409999c82b5028de6c7cf2957526baf2294)

&amp;#x200B;

[Column based grid](https://preview.redd.it/kx6c4yq4fgu41.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa0e245ba134f1c460ca640e8a3e02aa23b6eece)

To create a `GridView` you need to provide the minimum desired cell size, a `GeometryProxy` from the ancestor `GeometryReader`, specify what the base axis is, and an array of views to layout inside the grid.

The reason to require prebuilt cells, instead of a cell builder (like a `ForEach`) and a collection of models is to give the flexibility to provide different types of views as cells inside the grid.

I have a question, a big one at that. I'm currently in the process of developing a workout tracking platform for a school project. This platform will allow users to join groups, start challenges within those groups and compete against their friends.

However, I've developed the entirety of the program up until the actual workout tracking. I want the application to allow users to:

\- Start a workout at the click of a button, showing an elapsed time and metrics like steps, calories burnt, max heart rate, average heart rate periodically from their apple watch. Then, when they finish the workout, the data from this activity is saved into a Firestore database.

However, the main issue I'm having ( the one i've spent the last 2 days trying to figure out) is if it is possible to achieve this. I've tried using HKWorkoutBuilder, and that section of apples HealthKit but it doesn't seem to be able to achieve what I want.

During this free workshop led by Principal Engineer Paul Ort, we'll explore how SwiftUI and related developments on iOS make it possible to (1) combine the benefits of programmatic views and visual layouts, (2) apply a declarative UI paradigm popularized by React, (3) and make testing (historically an aspect of iOS development that has lagged behind web development) an stronger part of iOS architecture, in order to build mobile apps with greater confidence.

Hey Swift fam, I'm [Drew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-aquino/). I was the first iOS developer hired by [Bird](https://www.bird.co/) and for the past 2 and a half years I have helped build their iOS app encompassing Rider, Charger, Mechanic, Flyer, and Business platforms within the brand ecosystem. Our codebase was built from the ground up using [ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift) and I've worked with some of the best and brightest engineers that came from Snap, Instagram, Google, etc. Industry's best practices, architectural patterns, systems design, and so forth. I've learned a lot, unfortunately [this](https://dot.la/bird-layoffs-meeting-story-2645612465.html) happened. It was unbiased and like myself, a lot of other original engineers got let go as well. We still keep in touch.

However, I decided to look into business development and me and a handful of friends have built [Fable - Interactive Stories](https://fablestories.io/). 

# Tech Stack

Since we're all engineers, I'm going to dive right into the tech stack. The iOS app is built on `swift` with a mild hint of reactive programming. I built my own dependency injection [framework](https://github.com/DrewKiino/Firebolt) to handle [dependency resolution](https://learnappmaking.com/dependency-injection-swift/). It's currently using `UIKit` for UI development and [SnapKit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit) for constraint layouts. The overall architecture follows a [uni-directional](https://medium.com/@lizdenhup/understanding-unidirectional-data-flow-in-react-3e3524c09d8e) ""[single source of truth](https://medium.com/@edunceputans/single-source-of-truth-and-problems-with-implication-in-an-organisation-588883492133)"" [immutable](https://lkumarjain.blogspot.com/2016/02/immutable-design-pattern.html) design pattern. If you're intermediate to advance, hopefully this will fancy your quest for clean code.

# Team &amp; Current State

I'm going to be honest with you, I'm currently the only developer for this project along with my room mate who is our designer/project manager. The rest, although initially were able to help, aren't able to put in much time for the project anymore. I built the entire backend from scratch in Javascript which is currently what's powering our AppStore app, but I've made the decision to migrate our codebase to Kotlin using [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) instead, which currently is showing amazing promise and I'm happy with the decision. Our [CI/CD](https://medium.com/@nanduribalajee/what-is-ci-cd-pipeline-e2f25db99bbe) pipeline uses [Google Cloud Services](https://cloud.google.com/). The application is already out, however, progress is stifled.

We use JIRA as our issue tracking software, and a product roadmap for at least two versions out. Our goal is to create a desktop app along with our mobile applications. We know this can make money given the current landscape and the time to strike is now!

Please take a look at our [pitch deck](https://bit.ly/3cV6lXz).

SwiftUI is Apple’s new, unified framework for building interfaces across all of its platforms using Swift. It also enables new app architectures in the post-Objective-C era.

During this free workshop led by Principal Engineer Paul Ort, we'll explore how SwiftUI and related developments on iOS make it possible to (1) combine the benefits of programmatic views and visual layouts, (2) apply a declarative UI paradigm popularized by React, (3) and make testing (historically an aspect of iOS development that has lagged behind web development) an stronger part of iOS architecture, in order to build mobile apps with greater confidence.

Basically I coded a MacOS cocoa/Xcode app in swift and it uses one file in the resources folder that contains sensitive data and I don’t want hackers to be able to “show package contents” on my app to steal this specific file. 

I’m just looking for the simplest method possible to encrypt individual files in the resources folder of an Xcode Mac app so that they are visible to the app during runtime but invisible to anyone who tries to steal them out of the resources folder.

I found [this article](https://medium.com/faun/secure-coding-how-to-protect-your-secure-information-in-xcode-project-60c75258f576) online but it’s fairly complicated and I don’t understand the last few steps. Also I’m not using GitHub to host any of my code.

I figure there are surely other swift devs out there who build Mac apps and run into similar problems, so I just wanted to ask. If this is too off topic, or if this isn’t the right sub, I’d love to know where else I can look for help with this. Thank you",How to encrypt resources folder in swift Xcode application?

recently I started to work much more frequently with swift and I really enjoy the simplicity. Coming from C# there were some huge differences that I had to grasp but I’m getting along quite well. 

But there is one thing on my mind: When learning how write code, you almost always hear the concept of Data Encapsulation. In short terms, this means that changing values of object attributes should never happen directly but always over getters and setters oder functions. 

Now, when learning Swift, I noticed that this is something that is never brought up. Even on the official documentation they access attributes over simple dot syntax. Is there a reason why Swift does not follow this concept?

I have MIDI input working and a basic GUI made, but I'm running into two issues with displaying the notes pressed on the grid.

The grid is created dynamically using [SwiftUI Grid](https://github.com/spacenation/swiftui-grid) and ranges from 0-127 (for the small version). I've written a series of methods which map the MIDI input to the grid, and right now I'm able to respond to button presses by using .overlayPreferenceValue() in combination with published variables to pass data to and from my model. [Here's what it looks like](https://imgur.com/a/OFB155O) when 4 notes are held on the MIDI controller at once. Although this works I'm running into two issues:

Firstly, as you can see in the screenshot, the same notes repeat themselves a few times on the grid, but only one grid element is mapped per note. I did this by creating a method that converts MIDI notes to locations on the onscreen grid like so (128 values for the small MIDI controller version):

      func midiToSmallGrid(noteNumber: UInt8) -&gt; Int { let smallGrid: [UInt8: UInt8] = [ 30: 112, 31: 113, 32: 114, 33: 115, 34: 116, 35: 117, 36: 118, 37: 119, 38: 120, 39: 121, 40: 122, 41: 123, 42: 124, 43: 125, 44: 126, 45: 127, 46: 86, 47: 87, 48: 88, 49: 89, 50: 90, 51: 91, 52: 92, 53: 93, 54: 94, 55: 95, 56: 75, 57: 76, 58: 77, 59: 78, 60: 79, 61: 59, 62: 60, 63: 61, 64: 62, 65: 63, 66: 43, 67: 44, 68: 45, 69: 46, 70: 47, 71: 27, 72: 28, 73: 29, 74: 30, 75: 31, 76: 11, 77: 12, 78: 13, 79: 14, 80: 15, 190: 190 ]  return Int(smallGrid[noteNumber]!) } 

My initial thought was to create a dictionary of Int:\[Int\_x, Int\_y\] to map one note to multiple grid elements, but it seems like .overlayPreferenceValue() only accepts single variables. Is there a way to highlight multiple notes on the grid by passing .overlayPreferenceValue() an array?

Secondly, when no button is pressed, the setting value of .overlayPreferenceValue() is 0. This causes the highlight rectangle to start in the very first grid element (which is the first element in the array. Is there a way to hide the rectangles instead?

2082,3181,2020-05-06 08:36:47,3,1,"Hi everybody!

During the last week I decided to get familiar with Swift by porting to Swift the [suncalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) JavaScript library; a small library to calculate sun sunset/sunrise/position and moon position/phases.

This is the result: [suncalc-swift](https://github.com/THeK3nger/suncalc-swift).

I based my work on a previous abandoned port. But I am trying do much more than a simple 1:1 translation: I am trying to document every single function and variable (the original JS code is quite obfuscated so I needed to go back to the original math formulas), writing functions’ documentation and, more important,  trying to make the API more _swifty_.

And that’s the point. I am a TypeScript/Rust/Kotlin dev and I am still not very familiar with the Swift way of APIs. Moreover, the original JS API is rough and do not map very well to any statically typed language. 

For instance, the `getTimes` returns a dictionary of times such as `[ “sunrise”: Date, “sunset: Date, “dusk: Date, ...]` while `getMoonTimes` returns an Enumeration: one case contains the moonset date and the moonrise date, and the other two cases are a special value for the rare case in which the moon never rises (or never sets). I do not like this inconsistency.

Anyhow. As I said, I am inexperienced in Swift. Any comment on convention, suggestions and critiques are relay appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

As a SwiftUI learner, I wanted to develop some kind of medium where its users can actively interact with SwiftUI instead of simply reading the code and looking at screenshots.

Actively interacting with SwiftUI is only possible on Apple platforms, so it is not achievable on most websites or Android devices because Swift cannot run in such environments.

And that is why I decided to make an iOS app for this purpose!

&amp;#x200B;

This app is free and there are no ads whatsoever.

While I am not an advanced iOS developer by any means, I sincerely wish this app would serve its functions and assist its users to learn some SwiftUI!

Almost everything I found by googling around is `UIActivityViewController` which appears more to be about how to share content from my app to another app; while what I am trying to do is share urls from another app to my app. 

I am try to build a simple app for ios (doesnt have to be old version compatible because it will be only used by me) that can be a receiver for shared urls from apps like safari, brave or youtube. All the app does is when user clicks on the share button, and then chooses the app, the app gets the relevant data that is being passed, and then posts it to a backend server. 

I can accomplish this on my android app/devices with an intent filter action `android.intent.action.SEND` in the manifest, and then listening for it with `Intent intent = getIntent()` in my method. 

Would someone be kind enough to point me in the right direction at what I should look into (google about). If you can also point me to some sample code examples on how to write an app that can be the receiver for shared data (like urls), that would be fantastic.

   * User can click the chart color and see just the category info for that color.
* Budget:
   * see all the budgets that we created 
   * see how much you will need to save. (money per month, months to goo etc.)
* Adding Expense/Budget: 
   * Select a category
   * Insert Amount
   * Add new subcategories and the select the one that he need.
   * isMonthly: if selected the app will automatically add this expense each month.
   * Select the day for the expense.
* Stats:
   * user can chose the year
      *  for each year we can see the info for the respective month just by clicking in the chart month.
* Settings:
   * Account: nothing done at the moment.
   * Preference:
      * Inser monthly incoming
      * Update isMonthly expense date etc.
      * Select what category will apear in the Add Expense/Budget menu
      * Backup - nothing done at the moment. I was thinking in using Apple could or Firebase by google)
   * Notification: nothing done at the moment.
   * Contant Us:
      * Allow user to send an email.

[Godot](https://godotengine.org/features) is an open-source 2D and 3D game engine that works on Windows, macOS, Linux, BSD and deploys multi-platform games for mobile (both Android and iOS), desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux, BSD) and web. The engine supports adding new languages. Imagine cross-platform game development all in Swift! 

The basic process is:

* Recreate Godot's types in the new language (Vector3, int, float, String) if not already present
* Create a C++ module that creates binding code. The entire exposed Godot API can be accessed.
* Generate the binding code in the new language

[Python](https://github.com/touilleMan/godot-python) and [Lua](https://github.com/perbone/luascript) support was added as a scripting module. You can check out the GitHub on how it was done.

I was wondering if someone could help me, I don’t know if this is difficult or I’m being an idiot (I’m kinda new to swift) but here goes...

So I’m making an app where people can create music, you have beat, melody etc, and you set the tone and volumes of each. I want to make it so that there is an option to save your song when it’s finished. There is a tab on a UITabBar which contains the ‘saved’ section. I want the song to appear here, and the user is able to set a name for that song / composition. When you press on the song title (which will be a button) it will take you back to the main page where the sounds are, while updating these values to be what they were saved as. I would also like the user to be able to save multiple songs, and the app stores the data for each.

For example, if the user enters;

Drums.volume = 8
Guitar.volume = 6

When the ‘save’ button is hit, this will be saved and stored permanently until deleted.  I know how to store (and recall) these values however I can only store one or two, because I have to make new variables for these values to be stored in each time a new song is saved, so that these values can be recalled later. But I would like it do be an option to save as many as you’d like. Programmatically I do not know how to do this.

So far I’ve been using variables such as ‘Song1Guitar’ and ‘Song2Guitar’ to permanently save the volumes etc of the guitar part of the song these are then recalled when the user hits the song button (guitar.volume = Song1Guitar) etc.

How would I make it so that the user can save unlimited songs, and the data for each of its constituent instruments is saved? I also don’t know how I would then store these as buttons in a table view in the ‘saved’ page... know this is a lot to ask but I really need your help and appreciate any I can get. I’ve nearly finished the app but this is the last thing I need to do and is also probably the hardest...

Here is the game. It is 100% free. It is a word game. Make as many words as you can from the six letters on the screen. No logins. You are welcome to play. It is free. An interstitial ad pops up after ever 3rd completed puzzle.

I have two burning questions.

One. How much of your own personal code is copied from other sources?

Two. Does anyone else NOT use the Swift / SpriteKit UI at all when making games.

One. I am smart enough to hijack other algorithms and code and use them to suit my purpose, but am not smart enough to create the code myself. So all the truly difficult programming parts of this game were accomplished by someone else. Ray Wenderlich created an amazing recursive algorithm which finds all the possible combinations of a number, and I hijacked that code to find all the combinations of words.

There was another tricky part where I had to chunk arrays into parts if there was not enough room on the screen to display all the answers. I had to move the common words to the rare ones. And again, someone wrote a 'chunk' extension which allowed me to this. And the list goes on.

Two. I originally set out to make a new game using the swift / spritekit UI. I was going to code in 'correctly' with classes and good object oriented code, but it just became too bloated and difficult, and I once again reverted to my old way.

A blank screen and painstakingly programming by hand each element on the screen. The initial creation of the screen takes much longer, but the plusses of not using the UI are great. It leads to much quicker, faster code. And the game is much less likely to break.

Anyway any thoughts on this?",Swift / SpriteKit Game created with no UI interface and other programmers algorithms. Link and explanation below

I'm currently looking to implement a security policy for this app at work that requires us to document and follow an approach for handling open source software (OSS) vulnerabilities, i.e. checking the open source 3rd party libraries that we use against known vulnerability issues. I'm basing my approach on [this guide](https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/mobile-security-testing-guide/ios-testing-guide/0x06i-testing-code-quality-and-build-settings). I would like to automate the process as much as possible; ideally, a report should be generated any time our packages are updated, without requiring any manual work.

I've immediately run into a problem, though. We use both CocoaPods (as our main dependency manager) and SwiftPM (the only choice for some essential packages). And since SwiftPM has fewer packages, I started there. I thought I would simply wire up [this OWASP dependency checker](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck) in a custom build script, since it has [experimental support for SwiftPM packages](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/analyzers/swift.html). But I immediately realised that this script checks package.swift file, not  package.resolved. The .resolved file would be better, because (a) it indicates which exact versions of the packages are actually used, and (b) when [adding Swift packages to an Xcode project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app), Xcode doesn't seem to create package.swift, only package.resolved. So I literally can't run \`dependency-check\`; there is no package.swift.

I haven't even gotten to checking our CocoaPods packages yet, but aside from that, I'd like to figure out how to check our SwiftPM packages for known OSS vulnerabilities. I see two hypothetical solutions:

1. Create a dummy package.swift with the same stuff that we added to Xcode, and run \`dependency-check\` on that (not good, because as I mentioned, this doesn't check against the exact versions used in the app; also, we would need to remember to update the dummy any time we update the actual packages)
2. Find a different tool for checking OSS vulnerabilities that checks against package.resolved

I am using a WebView in my app. In there, I post JS in order to retrieve a token when I login on a website.

*If you want to know more, read on:*

[SwiftWebUI](https://github.com/SwiftWebUI/SwiftWebUI), an incredible implementation of SwiftUI for the web was released nearly a year ago. It showed how SwiftUI could have been created by Apple, and was a huge help in understanding SwiftUI for me.

The project, however, has one large drawback. It relies on a NIO server. Anytime you perform an action that requires Swift code to be executed, the site sends the action to the server, and the server rebuilds the DOM and sends the changes to the client for rendering. This is fine for toy projects, but we can do one better.

The code the server is executing is something you would normally want to run on the frontend. This is where WebAssembly comes in. Thanks to [swiftwasm](https://swiftwasm.org), we can compile our Swift code to WebAssembly.

Currently, swiftwasm does not work with Foundation, so I have removed any uses of Foundation in SwiftWebUI. The next step was creating a bridge from the library to the DOM. This was made easy thanks to [JavaScriptKit](https://github.com/kateinoigakukun/JavaScriptKit), which was made especially for swiftwasm. Now anytime State changes, or any other action triggers, the browser runs the code, and the DOM is updated.

I also wrote ""polyfills"" for `URLSession` (using JavaScripts `fetch`), `JSONDecoder` (using JavaScripts `JSON`), and GCD (which literally does nothing right now but could allow for concurrency via WASM) so that you could, in theory, have one codebase for iOS, macOS, and now the web.

If you build something cool with this, let me know! And if you have any questions or problems, leave an issue on GitHub or ask me here. There are still parts of SwiftWebUI that don't fully work yet.",SwiftUI for the Web using WASM

A bit of a long post I'm afraid. Thanks in advance. 
 
I have been learning swift for 3 months now, with a few small breaks here and there due to commitments. I try to do at least a little bit most days. A quick summary of what I've done so far:
 
* Started the 100 days of Hacking With Swift (HWS)
 
* After going through the fundamentals, I went through the Swift iBook to try and get a better understanding of the areas I wasn't sure about. I think this just made me more confused as increasingly more complex topics came up.

* I went through the 'Intro to App Development with Swift' iBook. This was pretty helpful, at least until the later lessons, that were not always straightforward to follow.
 
* I am now continuing with HWS, and following the app tutorials (currently on day 37). This is becoming pretty complex in some parts and I don't think I am learning a huge deal if I am honest. 
 
* I bought Angel Yu's Udemy course but haven't even got round to starting it yet...
 
Given my current knowledge (if you can call it that...), how do you think I should continue? 
 
I am particularly struggling with the logic/structure of apps. It its all well and good knowing what a method and loop is, but how the hell do I know where to put them? (e.g. in viewDidLoad() or in the ViewController class itself, or when do I need to use loadView()?). On top of this is the endless stream of in-built methods and properties, which I can't even remember 2% of.
 
I feel like I should be committing at least 2-3 hours a day to learning to even make a single bit of progress, but that isn't realistic. Some people say I should forget tutorials and start with building an app, but I don't feel like I know enough. I was thinking of a simple budgeting app (e.g. a tabbed app with one view showing transactions by week/month, and a second tab showing something else, e.g.  aggregated fingers by category),but this in itself seems a distant dream. 
 
Long story short. I am a bit lost in all of this, and don't know how best to continue. Any guidance from you experts would be greatly appreciated.",My head is all over the place learning Swift. I don't know how best to continue. All advice greatly appreciated.

The first error is easy enough to solve, simply erase the `@objc`from the beginning of the function.  I'm really not sure, but I think something about swift has updated since the publishing article that has made it unnecessary to put the objective-c designation, or something along those lines.

The second error is more confusing to me.  Why is the `self` an unresolved identifier?  Is this part of the article just out of date, because I can't copy and paste in the most basic form which has me a bit concerned that I don't know what the heck is going on.

I'm an incoming university freshman and am planning to search for internships in summer 2021. I was wondering if it was a good idea to learn swift/iOS in order to land an internship. I've been researching and it seems that there aren't too many jobs, especially for beginners like me. Is this true?

2224,2453,2020-06-28 12:44:09,6,1,"Hi! I am currently working on an open-source library to **highlight code** in **HTML**, **terminal** and **iOS/macOS apps**: [Lux](https://github.com/ABridoux/lux).  I tried Highlight.js or its iOS/macOS conversion (Highlighjr) but I was not satisfied with them for several reasons.  Also, Lux dedicated command-line tool makes it usable even for non Swift apps as long as they can execute it.

To let you know, [Lux](https://github.com/ABridoux/lux) currently supports: *Zsh/Bash*, *Swift* (with [Splash](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Splash) from John Sundell), *Xml* and *enhanced XML* (better visualisation of the tags), *Plist*, *Json*. It aims to be powerful and versatile as once you defined a regular expression and rules for a specific language, the library takes care of all output types (terminal, HTML and apps). Also theming is being added with Dracula as the first non default heme.

To show you quickly how you can use it, here is an example to inject colors in a Json string:

    let injector = JSONInjector(type: .app)
    textview.attributedText = injector.inject(in: content).nsAttributedString

The output type will depend on the injector type. Terminal and HTML injectors will output a `String` whereas App injector will output `AttributedString` (which is a wrapper around `NSMutableAttributedString`).

It is starting to be a huge project, and I think it could be really helpful in many projects - involving swift development or not. Thus, if you are interested and willing to **join the project**, you are more than welcome! It could be to [add a new language](https://github.com/ABridoux/lux/wiki/%5B30%5D-Add-a-new-language), a new theme, or any improvement you can think of. If necessary, you can contact me via DM or by [email](mailto:alexis1bridoux@gmail.com).

After all this I sit down in my desk for many many hours (8-15 hours) learning swift (YouTube, documentation, stackoverflow, errors, debugging, etc) and I didn’t feel overwhelmed, in fact every error that a could solve I was completely happy and more motivated.

I just started to teach myself Swift a few days ago, I have an intermediate level of knowledge with Javascript so I'm not totally new to coding, but I am definitely struggling with Swift and Xcode, hoping you guys can help.

&amp;#x200B;

First, to put the things I've read and watched over the last few days into practice, I am trying to rewrite a random password generator app from Javascript in Swift. When I started the project, I chose ""Single View App"" and went from there. I finished my UI and tried to link all my switches, sliders, and buttons from my main storyboard to CurrentView.swift but were unable to control and drag any elements from the storyboard into CurrentView. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up creating a cocoa touch class file titled ViewController.swift and was able to successfully control and drag all my elements there, but now while testing the app, I'll be shown my UI at first before the screen switches to ""Hello, World!"" from the CurrentView.swift file. For reasons beyond my current understanding, deleting the file causes issues with SceneDelegate because CurrentView() is never declared so that isn't an option. I figured I'd just move the code from CurrentView into ViewController since that was able to be linked to my storyboard. That then returns errors ""Invalid Declaration of 'ContentView'"".

&amp;#x200B;

I understand this is elementary to you guys but I'd really appreciate the help. I just need to get started on this first project so I'm able to learn, but as it currently stands I can't even test anything because I don't understand why CurrentView is seemingly a necessary file and prevents me from connecting my UI elements.

The [Argument Parser  Documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser/tree/master/Documentation) is very useful.

If we would like to make our command-line tool composable, we would like to support the following cases:

* If the tool is called without any parameters it'll try to read from the STDIN.
* If the tool's last argument is a single dash (`-`) read from the STDIN.

The same way as `sort(1)` or other Unix command-line tools work.

we can call:

    $ cat file.txt | sort 

or we can call:

I already know how to pass data between VCs via segues but can't find a definitive answer on what is the proper way of doing so with simple external function files (file -&gt; new -&gt; swift file).

I have my controller like so

`class MainVC: UIViewController {`

`var contentText: String = ""hello""`

`changeContent(inputText: ""world"")`

`}`

And a function in a separate file (say, file1.swift):

`func changeContent(inputText: String) {`

`MainVC.contentText = inputText`

`}`

It doesn't work, because, as I understand, MainVC is a class definition and not the instance I want to affect. I could do this using global variables but I assume there must be a better way. 

Most answers I found deal with passing data between different classes, whereas I'd like the function to essentially behave like it was inside MainVC (i.e. have access to its variables).

Not sure how to achieve that. Following some advice I also tried declaring my VC in the function file like that:

`var targetVC: MainVC()`

`func changeContent(inputText: String) {`

`targetVC.contentText = inputText`

`}`

It also doesn't seem to work (doing `print(targetVC.contentText)` is empty)  - and I'm not sure how would it get my existing MainVC instance as opposed to creating a new one.

so, when I load the entity, I have to decide where to use `loadGround()`, or `loadWall()`.

That will be like

    let entity = try! Experience.loadGround()

or

    let entity = try! Experience.loadWall()

So I create this class

    import Foundation
    import RealityKit
    class EntityRealityKit {
      class func load(type:NameTrackingType) -&gt; RealityKit.Entity
      {
        switch type {
        case .Ground:
          return try! Experience.loadGround()
        default: 
          return try! Experience.loadWall()
        }
      }
    }

but when I do this

        let entity = EntityRealityKit.load(tipo:type)
        arView.scene.anchors.append(entity)

I get an error on the second line saying `Cannot invoke 'append' with an argument list of type '(Entity)'`.

How can that be? `loadGround()` and `loadWall()` returns a `RealityKit.Entity`, right? The same my class `EntityRealityKit` does...

why?",Two codes that apparently do the same thing but one gives me an error...

How difficult would it be to replicate something like this with swift/swiftUI?   
What I want to try and achieve is simply just swiping down on only my app icon in the menubar and have the app window to pop/open up.

Currently I have the following code in my AppDelegate:

if let button = statusBar.button{   
button.action = #selector(self.handleOpenPlayerDescriptionWindow(\_:))  
button.sendAction(on: .swipe)                                  //Doesn't Work    
// button.sendAction(on: .leftMouseDown)   //Works just fine    
}  
\`@objc func handleOpenPlayerDescriptionWindow(\_ sender: NSMenuItem){  
 // code to load swiftUI Window    
//  ...   
}

As you can see, when I assign sendAction on 'leftMouseDown', it works perfectly fine, but any gesture/swipe related triggers don't work.

2255,231,2020-07-14 20:19:43,1,4,"A while back, I posted looking at ways to extract full coverage data for a Swift Package Manager package. At the time, I couldn't get the data exported in the correct format for the code coverage tool we were using.

I decided to start looking again, to see how it might be possible to get this data out of the coverage data generated by `swift test --enable-code-coverage`...

Long story short, I finally found a way, using [codecov.io](https://codecov.io) as the coverage tool.

So, first of all, sign up to [codecov.io](https://codecov.io) and allow it to see your git repository on your remote git repo. platform of choice. This should be all you need to do.

I've used an implementation of Point-Free's Parsers to demonstrate this: [https://github.com/rhysm94/Parsers](https://github.com/rhysm94/Parsers)

I'm using GitHub Actions for continuous testing, but you can use anything!
If you *are* using GitHub Actions, the most important file is my `swift.yml` file, which hopefully you should just be able to copy directly: [swift.yml](https://github.com/rhysm94/Parsers/blob/develop/.github/workflows/swift.yml)

Also copy this `codecov.yml` file into your `.github` directory: [codecov.yml](https://github.com/rhysm94/Parsers/blob/develop/.github/codecov.yml)

For other CI/CD tools, follow these steps:

To convert SwiftPM's code coverage format to `lcov`, run `swift test --enable-code-coverage` followed by:

    BIN_PATH=""$(swift build --show-bin-path)""
    XCTEST_PATH=""$(find ${BIN_PATH} -name '*.xctest')""
    COV_BIN=$XCTEST_PATH
    if [[ ""$OSTYPE"" == ""darwin""* ]]; then
    	f=""$(basename $XCTEST_PATH .xctest)""
    	COV_BIN=""${COV_BIN}/Contents/MacOS/$f""
    fi
    /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-cov export -format=""lcov"" \
      ""${COV_BIN}"" \
      -instr-profile=.build/debug/codecov/default.profdata \
      -ignore-filename-regex="".build|Tests""\ &gt; info.lcov

This will generate an `lcov` file, specifically ignoring anything in the `.build` and `Tests` directories, so you *shouldn't* generate coverage data for your unit tests. I did also have to add the [codecov.yml file](https://github.com/rhysm94/Parsers/blob/develop/.github/codecov.yml) mentioned above to get it to ignore the Tests directory, but this is just:

    ignore:
        - Tests

Once you have your `info.lcov` file, you just need to run the [Codecov uploader script](https://docs.codecov.io/docs) in your SwiftPM package repo directory, passing it the Codecov token.

And lo and behold, you should hopefully be getting genuinely useful code coverage data generated about your project, [as shown here for the above Parsers package](https://codecov.io/gh/rhysm94/Parsers)!

Hopefully this is useful to others looking to get over any problems with getting code coverage from pure Swift Package Manager packages!",Code Coverage for SwiftPM Packages

Problem to fix = displaying ‘zoomable’ portrait-limited iPhone apps on an iPad Pro, in landscape. (where there is more than enough screen space for it, at least on the Pro’s).  
As far as I know, at least I have not been able to find one, there are no iPhone built apps that will rotate into a vertical position on a landscape oriented iPad screen.  
And after doing some light research it would appear that the orientation control is done during programming, and it’s apparently not even an option for devs to allow their “tiny-on-the-iPad-screen” apps to rotate on the iPad’s screen.  
So when your iPad is docked and you open any number of non-optimized-for-iPad apps, you either have to bend your neck like you’re that spoon in The Matrix, or undock. Undocking isn’t always a hassle but it can be if you have a whole desktop-setup-thing goin’ on.

I’m building a poker app as a project to learn swift, and it’s been great so far but now I need some advice. 

I have a Table class that manages a list of players using my Player class. Players have names, chips, cards, images, views, etc. And my Table class has seats, cards, pot, etc. 

I have an Action view that I use to interact with game play. This is where player action buttons are kept. I also have a Poker Table view that displays where players are seated, their chips, name, etc. I can move them around, select dealer, deal cards, etc. 

The setup of a table is all well and good. I have checks to make sure I have enough players and that all of them are seated, and that a dealer is present. I then have a start button that initializes a Table. 

This is where I’m having a hard time sorting out how best to manage the game and views without turning it into spaghetti code. Do player actions go into my Player class? I have Table methods that sorta need to know what each player is doing too. Things feel like they need to be separate, but also connected.

I'm working my way through learning swift, but I'm stuck at trying to understand the difference between parameter and argument labels in functions. As well as understanding the language of things. For example words like ""pass"".

Ok, so every time I search google for ""understanding argument labels swift functions"" I get a bunch of verbage about how a parameter label is for passing through an external parameter, and the argument label is for internal.  And then I read that if you don't have an argument label, that you parameter name is the same thing. There's still this thing of not knowing what the word pass means. 

I've tried for about an hour today, but I'm still unsure I get *what* it is they are used for with respect to each other.  Does this make sense?  Is there any way someone could please explain this to me like I'm a five year old? (Because sometimes that's a bit what it feels like.)

First, let me say I've really loved learning how to code. It's something I never thought I'd be good at. It turns out, that it's a wonderful thing to realize you can still surprise yourself. 

So I've spent a fair deal of time with iPhone apps as instruction, YouTube series, and a couple of courses.  They've all been great. Really exceptional. I've been at these for about three to four months. I redo assignments to make sure I know what I've done, record notes in a notebook, rewrite those notes, add notes to my assignments, and  ask what I think are pretty good questions. It's something that outside of some personal issues that needed my attention, I've spent a fair deal of time and focus on. 

Now, where I'm at currently is this place where I've learned some really good basics and rudiments. The grassroots. I'm learning my way around Xcode and really enjoying the swift language. 

What I'm struggling with is seeing all of these really incredible bits of codes, and having *no* idea how the person that wrote them came up with them. Is this normal?   

I kinda feel that way in some  parts of the classes. The internet reference is '... now draw the rest of the F'ing owl. That's kinda how I feel right now.  

Or like I've studied some high school physics, and then someone just gave me the blueprints to a car and send, ""Here. Make this."" 

I feel like the consensus is that this is all pretty normal right? Does that feeling ever go away?  That one of not knowing how someone got to where they are?

            // initializer implementation goes here
        }

This entails that the subclasses don't have to inherit the superclasses' initializers.  In fact, this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30087117/10116367) says that if a subclass has a designated initializer of its own, then it doesn't have to inherit the superclass' initializer.

However, the [Swift documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Initialization.html) says that every class has to have a at least one designated initializer that ""calls an appropriate superclass initializer to continue the initialization process up the superclass chain.""

My questions are:

1. Can a subclass not inherit the superclass' initializer and, if so, in what cases it is beneficial to not inherit it? 
2. What exactly does the required initializer do and in what case is satisfying the initializer inheritance requirement necessary?",Required initializer for subclasses?

I implemented flood fill which successfully fills the region of rasterized image. At this point, however, I have several questions I am looking to answer in order not to end up on dead end.

First, is it better to use rasterized or vectorized images? I have also tried to implement the logic for vectorized image but I faced a number of problems using 3rd party libraries. Right now, I try to implement zoom using macaw and I haven’t managed to make it smooth. My main concerns in case of using radterized images on the other hand, is also user experience - I wouldn’t like the image to appear pixelated while zooming.

Second, is it better to do ot with SpriteKit or as a regular storyboard/swiftui app? While trying out SpriteKit, I noticed that zooming and traversing the image could be done by using camera node.

Third, is flood fill the right method to use or is ot better to implement some different logic?

I'm trying to work through one of Angela Yu's exercises (iOS Bootcamp, section 9)  that use three folders. They are Model, View, and Controller. The idea here is to pass data from one swift file to the next. There's a couple of instances where this has happened already, but from her instruction.  

So say for example in the Model file, there's a struct created called QuizBrain. In the viewcontroller file there's, 'var quizBrain = QuizBrain.'  That works, in the sense that after the equal sign, the 'QuizBrain' appears. 

I created a var in the model, but it isn't being recognized in the controller. I get the message, ""Use of unresolved identifier 'score'"", as score is the variable that I created.  I've tried this the other way as well, so creating the var in the viewcontroller, and trying to get it in the model, but nothing works.  

Basically, I'm trying to get the users score to appear in the app view. So that when the user gets it right, the score is updated on the screen.

I'm pretty sure this is a simple fix, but nothing I can find in stack overflow seems to address this.

Basically from, ""*//This creates a struct...*"" to ""*Answer = a*"" used to be on one file. The rest of this code was on another. Why was that?  Near as I can tell, I was able to copy the code from that smaller file, and add it to this file with the bigger list of its struct. 

The other thing I'm really confused about is how the system of Structs works here.  From what I can tell, the 'init' code initializes the struct and then *makes it able* to be used as another object. Right?  So then why was there two structs, and how does that work?  Why wouldn't the coder have just used one struct? 

Thank you everyone who has already replied to my posts, and thank you to all those that do in the future. I'll be on for the next few  hours so can respond as needed.

2295,2542,2020-07-27 16:00:39,5,1,"Hi Everyone, 

I’ve been learning swift for three to four months now, and have a pretty good understanding of its basics. For example, I can write an if statement, switch, for in loop, and get some simple stuff to happen in little apps. I’m really loving it all.

However, there’s this thing that keeps happening and I’m pretty sure it’s just as basic, but I have a hunch that it was something I missed while learning, or didn’t give enough attention to. I’m trying to be transparent here. 

I think it has something to do with where the curly braces are. Again, I’m not sure what this issue is called, or really how to discuss it. If I knew what this was, I think my coding experience would go a lot smoother.

I’ll put the following code below as an example, using 'var testOne = 0' to test with. This code does all work, so I’m just using this for reference to explain what I'm struggling with. This very simple app is just something that randomly displays two numbers between a range, and checks to see if they're a match or not.

Ok. Code for reference:

    class ViewController: UIViewController {

    var testOne = 0

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }
    var testTwo = 0
    
    @IBOutlet weak var secondNumber: UILabel!
    @IBOutlet weak var firstNumber: UILabel!
    @IBOutlet weak var otherInfoLabel: UILabel!
    @IBAction func checkButton(_ sender: UIButton) {
        
        let rangeSetter = 1...4
        
        let firstNumberArray = Int.random(in: rangeSetter)
        let secondNumberArray = Int.random(in: rangeSetter)
        
        firstNumber.text = ""\(firstNumberArray)""
        secondNumber.text = ""\(secondNumberArray)""
        
        if firstNumber.text == secondNumber.text {
            otherInfoLabel.text = ""It's a match!""
        } else {
            otherInfoLabel.text = ""No match yet...""
            
        }
    }
    }


So if I put the code **var testOne = 0** right after the ‘class ViewController’ line, I cannot get it to repopulate afterwards. If I start typing ‘testOne’, nothing appears. I think that means I’ve done something wrong. 

I tried the same thing while writing  **var testTwo = 0** after ‘overRide func’, and nothing appears.  

However, if I go to the ‘@IBAction fun checkButton, I can start to call for either of the vars I’ve just created. Further, if I go to where my if statement is, they will appear to also work there. They will *not* however work right above the *last* curly brace in the code.

Why is it working in these places, but nowhere else?  What is all of this called?  I’ve noticed that this happens outside of things like vars. It will also happen with structs and functions that I’m writing.

This is proving to be really been frustrating for me to work through while learning to code. Is this something that has a name? What’s the topic that I need to look up on and research more?


Thank you all kindly. I can’t begin to tell you all how supportive this community has been for me to deal with.","I think I’m getting closer to what I think has been a major learning obstacle, but I’m unsure of what to call it."

2316,3359,2020-08-04 00:39:17,5,1,"I'm trying to understand this how the [mapValues](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/dictionary/2995348-mapvalues) method works in the following code from [Calendar Heatmap](https://github.com/Zacharysp/CalendarHeatmap/blob/master/Example/CalendarHeatmap/ViewController.swift).

&amp;#x200B;

1. First, a function loads a dictionary:

    private func readHeatmap() -&gt; [String: Int]? {
        guard let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: ""heatmap"", withExtension: ""plist"") else { return nil }
        return NSDictionary(contentsOf: url) as? [String: Int]
    }

&amp;#x200B;

[heatmap.plist](https://github.com/Zacharysp/CalendarHeatmap/blob/master/Example/CalendarHeatmap/heatmap.plist) is a key/value list like this:

        &lt;key&gt;2019.5.3&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;integer&gt;3&lt;/integer&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;2019.5.5&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;integer&gt;4&lt;/integer&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;2019.5.7&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;integer&gt;3&lt;/integer&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

2. A property named `data` is initialized using the above function:

    lazy var data: [String: UIColor] = {
        guard let data = readHeatmap() else { return [:] }
        return data.mapValues { (colorIndex) -&gt; UIColor in
            switch colorIndex {
            case 0:
                return UIColor(named: ""color1"")!
            case 1:
                return UIColor(named: ""color2"")!
            case 2:
                return UIColor(named: ""color3"")!
            case 3:
                return UIColor(named: ""color4"")!
            default:
                return UIColor(named: ""color5"")!
            }
        }
    }()

&amp;#x200B;

3. Finally, the `data` property defined above is used in the following function:

    func colorFor(dateComponents: DateComponents) -&gt; UIColor {
        guard let year = dateComponents.year,
            let month = dateComponents.month,
            let day = dateComponents.day else { return .clear}
        let dateString = ""\(year).\(month).\(day)""
        return data[dateString] ?? UIColor(named: ""color6"")!
    }

&amp;#x200B;

Apple's documentation states that `mapValues` returns a dictionary ""containing the keys of this dictionary with the values transformed by the given closure.""  

&amp;#x200B;

My questions is, what exactly is the value `colorIndex` passed into the closure in `data.mapValues { (colorIndex) -&gt; UIColor in`? Is it from `heatmap.plist`? I'm confused how a `String` is passed into `date`, `date[dateString]` from the `colorFor(dateComponents: )` function, but `colorIndex` is `Int`.",Help me understand how the closure work in the method mapValues

I'm calling this method when the user clicks an add button after typing something into a text field on a separate view controller from the tableView. The thing they type is supposed to get added to the table view, but it doesn't, and I just get an error.

I looked online and found people with similar problems but I couldn't figure out how to implement them into my code or didn't understand them as I am very new to swift. I also tried putting the text field on the same view controller as the table view and that fixed the problem, so I'm guessing it has something to do with that.

I have all my code in ViewController.swift. Here it is:

```swift

Also, I tried optional chaining on the line that gave me an error by writing, `tableView?.reloadData()`. It makes the error go away, but none of the items get added to the table view.

        override func prepare(for segue:UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
            if segue.identifier == ""favoriteWordSegue"" {
    
                let destinationVC = segue.destination as! FavoriteWordDefinitionViewController
                    destinationVC.key = key
    
            }
        }
    

Below is the viewController presented using the segue and when a user selects a word from the table. 

    import UIKit
    
    class FavoriteWordDefinitionViewController: UIViewController {
        
        var key: String?
        
        
        @IBOutlet var wordLabel: UILabel!
        @IBOutlet var pronounciationLabel: UILabel!
       
        @IBOutlet var definition: UILabel!
       @IBOutlet var verbDefinition: UILabel!
        
        
        override func viewDidLoad() {
             super.viewDidLoad()
            
            for (keyWord, value) in favoriteWords {
                if key == keyWord {
                    wordLabel.text = value.word
                    pronounciationLabel.text = value.pronounciation
                    definition.text = value.definition
                    verbDefinition.text = value.verbDefinition
                } else {
                    wordLabel.text = ""Error you fucked up""
                    pronounciationLabel.text = """"
                    definition.text = """"
                    verbDefinition.text = """"
                }
            }
            }

When a user selects a cell from the table, I want the the didSelectTableRowAt method to get the string of the text label and assign it to the ""key"" variable. Which will then be passed on to the next viewController. Before the new viewController loads, I want the viewDidLoad() function to see if it matches the key value of the favoriteWords dictionary and assign the string value of the property to the appropriate label. 

What actually happens is that I get the ""Error you fucked up"" every single time. My gut tells me I'm not assigning the textLabel of the cell to the ""key"" variable correctly. I've tried changing the wordIdentifier and I get the same result. 

If anyone can chime in and tell me where I should be looking for a fix I'd appreciate it. Thanks!",Why is passing an object via segue depending on the textLabel of a cell in my UITableView not working the way I think it should?

1. How can I display just one image instead of all 3?
2. How to display second image instead of first after tapping a button?
Let me know if needs more info. Thank you in advance!

2338,2487,2020-08-11 08:16:35,6,1,"This seems like it should be possible, but looking at the [docs]([https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html]), and trying things out in playgrounds, I can't figure out how.

So tl;dr, how do I do this?

```
func foo(input: Int) -&gt; Result&lt;Int, Error&gt; {
   do {
      let response = tryMap(input)
      return .success(response)
   } catch { // I want to catch all errors here
      return .failure(error) // how do I get the error?
   }
}
```

Why?

I've got a factory class thing that takes (among others) a closure for mapping protobuf responses to internal types, and returns an object that makes grpc calls. If the endpoint returns a success response, the closure is applied to map the response to an internal type and return a `Response.success(...), and if the endpoint fails, the object returns a `Result.failure` with the error. It works well, but now I'd like to be able to convert from ""valid"" inputs to errors, if applicable. For example, some responses from endpoints contain an error in a success response. I want the closure to be able to unpack the protobuf response and turn it into an error if needed.

To keep the code as simple as possible for clients of the factory (who will provide the closure), I'm trying to avoid changing the return type of the closure to `Result`; the closure should simply throw and error if the input is invalid, and then I'd like the object created by the factory to catch those errors (which can be of any type) and map it into a `Result.failure`.",Is it possible to access the error value in a catch block?

2340,2485,2020-08-12 08:56:17,6,1,"I know this is a big and a very broad question, but I don't have anyone else to ask.

I hired someone to build an app system for my parents pizza shop, but after I paid him - he dissappered. I am left without money or a functional app. This was 2 months ago, I have since learned a little programming/swift and fixed as many bugs as I  could, but this part is way beyond my skill level, with out help.

The build system consists of two apps - which can find each other over wifi and you can connect them:  
In app 1, you enter the orders.

In app 2, this app is in the kitchen, showing the orders. 

  
They connect through wifi, and as long as I try the system as one Ipad simulator and one real Ipad (simulator on Mac, and Ipad connected through USB), it all works perfectly.

But when I try to connect two real Ipads, they can find each other and one Ipad can chose second iPad, but when I try to send an order, I get error: ""Failed to connect to \\(host) @ \\(address.port)""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

    func deliver(action: Action, to addresses: [Socket.Address], completion: ((Swift.Error?) -&gt; ())? = nil) {
    		
    let queue = DispatchQueue.global(qos: .default)
    		
    queue.async {
    			
    	let complete: (Swift.Error?) -&gt; () = { (error) in
    	DispatchQueue.main.async { completion?(error) }
            }
    			
    	guard let socket = try? Socket.create()
    	else { return complete(Error.couldNotCreateSocket) }
    			
    	for address in addresses {
    	    guard let host = address.host else { continue }
    	    do {
    		try socket.connect(to: host, port: Int32(address.port), timeout: 5)
    		break
    	    } catch {
    	        print(""Failed to connect to \(host) @ \(address.port)"")
                }
    	}

This is of course just a snippet of the communications files, but its where the error is explained, and finally to my question:  
Does anyone understand/have an idea why they work with usb/simulator but not with real iPads? 

Maybe If I could understand why, then I can learn the right topics and try to fix/tweak it.",Failed to connect to \(host) @ \(address.port)

2343,2482,2020-08-13 02:58:40,9,1,"So I'm experimenting with API's in swift (with a coronavirus API) and I've come across a bit of a problem. So after following many tutorials, I managed to get this app somewhat working, but the list where I hold all the data on different corona facts gets a bunch of duplicated items due to the nature of the UICollectionView function, cellForItemAt. Ultimately I need some way of storing the data from the API call in a list that can be accessed outside of the closure parameter on the function I use to make the API call, but I don't know if that's possible since it's asynchronous code. I'm really curious about how people solve this dilemma! I think this will make more sense when you see the code. Here is the function for making the API call:

    func getData(from url: String, completed: @escaping ([CoronaInfo]?) -&gt; ()) {
        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: URL(string: url)!) { data, response, error in
            // Make sure that data isn't nil and that there was no error
            guard let data = data, error == nil else { print(""Something went wrong""); return }
            
            do {
                // Convert data from bytes to the custom object (Known as JSON decoding)
                let result = try JSONDecoder().decode([CoronaInfo].self, from: data)
                
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    completed(result)
                }
            } catch { print(error) }
        }.resume()
    }

And here is my viewController class file (I left a comment on the line where I'm printing the list that I get duplicated items):

    import UIKit
    
    class FirstViewController: UIViewController, UICollectionViewDataSource, UICollectionViewDelegate {
        
        var coronaWorldInfo: CoronaInfo?

        let url = ""https://coronavirus-19-api.herokuapp.com/countries""
        
        override func viewDidLoad() {
            super.viewDidLoad()
        }
        
        // MARK: Collection View Functions

So this app main duties would include checking status of PC (Online/Offline), Status of Desk in which case would check Physical PC Unit (Hostname) Network Status via GOP, Along with Hardware available from Screen/Keyboard/Mouse and Headset.

&amp;#x200B;

Purpose of this app:

A business, I know have to often move desks along with the equipment that are moved across. In this move, often PC's are replaced with newer models / builds. Overall I was planning to create an app whereby utilizing AR and iPhone camera. Can a desk be scanned either could be QR Code System or Scan Desk No from Database highlighting each equipment via Serial number stored on an internal database (which also has to be created manually). 

I know it sounds bizarre and pragmatic but I want to make this a bespoke app for this company. I was wondering whether this would be feasible within Swift Programming Language. Which I am also learning at the same time along with Swift UI.  


My background I have programming experience and picking up the swift language was not hard as most concepts were the same. 

Help or Perspective from Someone would really be appreciated.",IT Support Health Check App

However, nobody's ever made a port of the really cool [JFugue](http://www.jfugue.org/examples.html) project for the Swift language. I'm totally up for the challenge (of at least getting the Staccato Markup Language working), but not sure how to begin.  


 I think if there is a port algorithmic music and tools for hobbyist musicians would be a lot easier to make. For example, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/4hd057/suggestions_for_creating_midi_filessequences_at/) user's post would have gotten more help.  


What I've found out so far is that the closest thing to [JFugue](http://www.jfugue.org/examples.html) in Swift seems to be [MIKMIDI](https://github.com/mixedinkey-opensource/MIKMIDI). I think I'd need to build out the Staccato Music Markup to MIDI first, and then have MIKMIDI play it.   


Interestingly enough, there's a port for C\\C++ called [CFugue](http://cfugue.sourceforge.net/docs/html/index.html) and a port for C# called [NFugue](https://github.com/mchudy/NFugue), but there's sadly no objective-CFugue or SwiftFugue.

2350,1335,2020-08-15 18:52:14,3,1,"So I know quite a few programming languages with fairly different syntaxes from rust to python to c++ to scheme. But this, this I have never seen:

    struct LandmarkList: View {
        var body: some View {
            List(landmarkData, id: \.id) { landmark in
                LandmarkRow(landmark: landmark)
            }
        }
    }

This piece of code is from the SwiftUI tutorials. I typically don't like going through regular ol programming language tutorials because most languages are very similar to it's easy to pick up on them. But this is different than anything I've ever really seen, and I can't understand what's happening.

1. I looked up with the `\.` and got that it's called a ""key-path-expression"", but I have no idea what that means.

2. It looks like we're defining a computed property called `body` similar to what we see in C# or vue.js, right?

3. But within these braces we just put what looks like some `List` constructor. Ok, maybe it's like rust where no `return` statement is needed?

4. But you can also construct multiple objects... and there's no commas separating them so it's clearly not a list or anything?

5. Then the construction of the List has braces after it. Ok, again possibly like rust. But we have no labels on which fields we're initializing. So how does it know which is which? And additionally we have things like `HStack` where I can just put an arbitrary number of different objects between those braces. Finally we're mixing and matching both parenthesis and brace construction. So what the heck?

6. Then finally we have the odd python-like iteration. But how does it know what it's iterating over? Clearly we passed the `landmarkData` list in the `List` constructor but that's not intuitive at all. Why do we pass what we're iterating over in the parenthesis and then the expression in the braces? That's very confusing.

Overall if somebody can help me unpack all the weird stuff going on here that would be a great help. I know I could go through the swift language reference and just spend a few hours on there, but I learn a bit better by looking at actual code and seeing what's going on.

Thanks!",What is this syntax?

1. [PagerManager](https://medium.com/display-and-use-heart-rate-with-healthkit-on/how-to-implement-page-control-in-swiftui-on-watchos-f7c6544f5034) \- programmatically, all in SwiftUI
2. [SwiftUIPager](https://github.com/fermoya/SwiftUIPager) \- a Swift Package that has swipable pages
3. Just using the storyboard, as explained [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57331552/implementing-page-based-navigation-for-swiftui-apple-watch-app/62392066?noredirect=1#comment112174864_62392066https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57331552/implementing-page-based-navigation-for-swiftui-apple-watch-app/62392066?noredirect=1#comment112174864_62392066)

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to make something similar to the apple watch exercise app when there is a current workout.

There are 3 views.  The initial view is the one in the middle (in the exercise app it shows current exercise information), there is a view on the left (in the exercise app this would be pause/stop), and a view to the right of the initial view (in the exercise app this is now playing).

Solution 1, the PagerManager method, is clunky and kind of ugly.

Solution 2, SwiftUIPager, would probably work, but I could only find how to use it like a for loop where you have a standard view mold in which you can plug in different things pre-planned spots.  There is probably a way to make it serve up entirely different views, but I'm not sure how.

Solution 3, storyboards, is the one I want to go with as it adheres to the Apple looks of things, but I'm facing 2 problems here.

1. Using the stackoverflow information I found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57331552/implementing-page-based-navigation-for-swiftui-apple-watch-app/62392066?noredirect=1#comment112174864_62392066) I can make as many views as I want *to the right* of the initial view, but how can I make a view (storyboard HostingController) that segues to another view to the left?
2. I can't make another set of Views in the storyboard independent of the view the app starts on

To explain (2) a little better, if I'm on a view that was gotten to through a navigation link, let's say I hit a button in my app and it takes me to a new view, how can I make that new view work within the storyboard?  I think when the view is gotten through a button click in SwiftUI, it might be impossible to have that view represented in the storyboard with segues to other views.

I basically don't know UIKit, nor have I used storyboards before, and I know these questions might require quite a bit of explanation, but if anyone knows a good explanation of storyboards in SwiftUI, that would also be very helpful.

First a little about me to help paint a picture of what I bring to the job market and hopefully shape your answers:

-	I am a self-taught developer with no degree or work history in computer science
-	I have developed an (unpublished) app and worked on various swift projects over the course of a year
-	I have created a software in C# for my current company. It’s not complex but it does a variety of tasks to automate workflow and improve efficiency
-	I’m extremely passionate about development, specifically apps because I love the junction of function and design

With that aside, my general gripe is that I’m not seeing much out there in the way of entry-level positions for iOS developers. A lot of what I see is either a senior position, or if it is entry level it’s for a React position. I’ve been looking mainly on Indeed and google’s integrated job search tool. I’m so excited about the potential career change, and I want so badly to be part of the culture, learn all the things that I‘m supposed to know, and grow as a developer. However, that’s a hard task to accomplish on my own, because I’m not sure what is worth learning and what isn’t, and if I don’t know what I don’t know, how can I learn it?

My questions:

1.	What are the best sites for browsing developer jobs? I am mainly focused on app development though I think I would really enjoy software development as well, just from my small amount of time doing it. 
2.	Are there skills or certifications that I can acquire in a short timeframe (&lt;1 month) that will immediately make me more marketable?
3.	How did you get your first gig? Not limited to iOS development, but just in general?

I wrote a short post on using SwiftNIO. I haven't seen much love for anything other than SwiftUI on the subreddit, so if you want to have a short break from it and look into Server-Side Swift, this might be interesting.

I understand we need to code some way to remove these cards in the CardView from the cards array. And we are given this property to put into the CardView:

    var removal: (() -&gt; Void)? = nil

I have never seen this before, is this some sort of computed variable? Is this shorthand for something? How does it work?

We are also given this line to call the removal var:

    self.removal?()

That apparently will call the removal var if it is set, but I am not sure why it would even call it because the removal var is set to nil? Not sure how removal var would be set amongst the other code for CardView.. 

here is the full CardView code:

    struct CardView: View {
        @Environment(\.accessibilityDifferentiateWithoutColor) var differentiateWithoutColor
        
        @State private var isShowingAnswer = false
        
        let card: Card
        
        // a closure that accepts no parameters and sends nothing back, defaulting to nil so we don’t need to provide it unless it’s explicitly needed
        var removal: (() -&gt; Void)? = nil
        
        // track how far user has dragged:
        @State private var offset = CGSize.zero

                    differentiateWithoutColor ? Color.white : Color.white

2373,588,2020-08-23 14:56:29,3,1,"Hi everyone

This is one of my first time going solo on a SwiftUI project (not following any tutorials or guides) and what I'm trying to build my not be possible or I might not yet understand the concept linked to this issue but here's my little problem:

I created a TabView with tabViewStyle(PageTabViewStyle())  
 and would like to have a different LinearGradient as background for each of the pages. So far that wasn't too hard to build, however, I'd like the LinearGradients to transition gracefully from one to another (I did it successfully for plain Color elements with the .animation(.default)modifier.  

This is what I tried so far:

With an array of gradients =&gt; The animation does not happen (the LinearGradient will change abruptly between pages)

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var selected = 0
    
    var blueBackground = LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [Color.blue, Color.white]), startPoint: .topLeading, endPoint: .bottomLeading)
    
    var grayBackground = LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [Color.gray, Color.white]), startPoint: .topLeading, endPoint: .bottomLeading)
    
    var gradients: [LinearGradient] {
        return [blueBackground, grayBackground, grayBackground]
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Rectangle().fill(gradients[selected]).edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
            
            TabView(selection: $selected){
                Text(""☀️"").font(.title).tag(0)
                Text(""🌦"").font(.title).tag(1)
                Text(""⛈"").font(.title).tag(2)
            }.indexViewStyle(PageIndexViewStyle(backgroundDisplayMode: .always))
            .tabViewStyle(PageTabViewStyle())
        }.animation(.easeIn)
    }
    
}
```
With a ""conditional rendering"" =&gt; The animation happens, but I get a weird ""flash"" when going from one page to another (see https://twitter.com/MaximeHeckel/status/1297380458163056640 for a video recording)

 ```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var selected = 0
    
    var blueBackground = LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [Color.blue, Color.white]), startPoint: .topLeading, endPoint: .bottomLeading)
    
    var grayBackground = LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [Color.gray, Color.white]), startPoint: .topLeading, endPoint: .bottomLeading)
    
    var gradients: [LinearGradient] {
        return [blueBackground, grayBackground, grayBackground]
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            if selected == 0 {
                Rectangle().fill(gradients[0]).edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
            } else {
                Rectangle().fill(gradients[1]).edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
            }
            
            TabView(selection: $selected){
                Text(""☀️"").font(.title).tag(0)
                Text(""🌦"").font(.title).tag(1)
                Text(""⛈"").font(.title).tag(2)
            }.indexViewStyle(PageIndexViewStyle(backgroundDisplayMode: .always))
            .tabViewStyle(PageTabViewStyle())
        }.animation(.easeIn)
    }
}
```

How would I go about triggering a file transfer when one phone is laying on top of the other? I was thinking an NFC connection between the two phones (only to establish connection, not to transfer the actual data), or both of the phones using the proximity sensor, or even making use of the gyroscope to detect if both phones are horizontal.

However, firstly, I know the placement of the respective NFC tags are very specific, so I'm not sure laying one on top of the other would successfully trigger a connection (the phones would be facing the opposite direction). Moreover, the other two methods have a lot of edge cases (eg.: proximity - phone in pocket).

An integral part of the user experience is not having to choose which phone they want to share data with, just needing to seamlessly put one phone on top of the other.

I'm debating on a few things for my home development and testing. I understand that without Xcode on an actual Mac I'm out of luck when it comes to a few things, I'm using the Swift compiler for Ubuntu for now but there is also a site (repl.it) that I can use to have an online swift compiler. I'm going to be presenting repl.it to the class for my teacher to use next Tuesday since I recommended it to him and he seemed to be into the idea of using it class-wide.

Now, for an introductory course will my Ubuntu version of swift be good enough to get some coding in between class sessions, or should I opt to use repl.it more? I will be buying an iMac eventually, but just looking for what is considered the best temporary solution.

Also, are there any recommended IDE's to use Swift on Ubuntu, or is it a ""use whatever"" sort of thing? I have an iPhone too if there are any resources for Swift I can use on that too, I am brand new to the Apple ecosystem.

2387,2506,2020-08-30 10:23:04,7,1,"I just finished Project 19 (the last project called SnowSeeker) in hackingwithswift's 100 Days of SwiftUI, and I was stuck on the [last challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/snowseeker-wrap-up) for hours until I finally figured out how to do it. (the challenge was letting the user sort the List by default, Name and Country). I wanted to use an actionsheet tied to a navbar button for users to select the three sorting options. 

However, I'm not sure if the code I ended up with is the best way to sort the list; so my question to the experts on this thread is: Is there a better way to implement this? Is my way acceptable? 

I tried googling around but didn't find anything on implementing sorting via actionsheets. 

Here is my contentview code:

    struct ContentView: View {
        @ObservedObject var favorites = Favorites()
        
        @State private var showingSheet = false
    
        let resorts: [Resort] = Bundle.main.decode(""resorts.json"")
        
        // this @State doesn't seem like the best way to do this but it works with the actionsheet buttons.
        @State var sortType = ""default""
        
        var body: some View {
            NavigationView {
                List(resorts.sorted(by: { (lhs: Resort, rhs: Resort) -&gt; Bool in
                    //this uses the sortType var to set the sorting
                    if sortType == ""Name"" {
                        return lhs.name &lt; rhs.name
                    } else if sortType == ""Country"" {
                        return lhs.country &lt; rhs.country
                    } else {
                        return false
                    }
                })) { resort in

                }))
                .actionSheet(isPresented: $showingSheet) {
                    ActionSheet(title: Text(""Sort""), message: Text(""Select type of sort""), buttons: [
                        .default(Text(""Default""), action: {self.sortType = ""default""}),
                        .default(Text(""Name""), action: {self.sortType = ""Name""}),
                        .default(Text(""Country""), action: {self.sortType = ""Country""}),
                        .cancel()
                    ])
                }
                
                WelcomeView()
            }
            .environmentObject(favorites)
        }
    }

Note that I needed to manually make my Resort struct Comparable, and I was stuck for ages wondering how to compare multiple properties of the resort in the static func but finally realised you could just add them together separated by commas \`,\`:

    struct Resort: Codable, Identifiable, Comparable {
        let id: String
        let name: String
        let country: String
        let description: String
        let imageCredit: String
        let price: Int
        let size: Int
        let snowDepth: Int
        let elevation: Int
        let runs: Int
        let facilities: [String]
        
        var facilityTypes: [Facility] {
            facilities.map(Facility.init)
        }
        
        static func &lt; (lhs: Resort, rhs: Resort) -&gt; Bool {
            // didn't know you could do it like this:
            (lhs.name, lhs.id, lhs.country) &lt; (rhs.name, rhs.id, rhs.country)
        }
        
        static let allResorts: [Resort] = Bundle.main.decode(""resorts.json"")
        static let example = allResorts[0]
    }

I'm happy that it works, and if any other learners in the future are stuck on this at least they have this here for future reference.

`return UIScreen.main.traitCollection.userInterfaceStyle`

Created my own Colors class such as:

`internal enum Colors {`

`static var testDarkLightColor: UIColor { return (kUserInterfaceStyle == .dark) ? UIColor.white : UIColor.black }`

`}`

...and assigned it to my views, labels, etc.

Created an extension of UIColor and tried overriding the system colors such as:

`static var systemBackground: UIColor { return (kUserInterfaceStyle == .dark) ? UIColor.red : UIColor.blue }`

2408,1210,2020-09-11 15:33:12,9,1,"Hi everyone,

Novice here. While learning swift I've noticed that there are times when something needs dot notation, and others require brackets.  I've looked online but can't seem to make sense of it.

As far as I know, I can use dot notation for calling parameters of a struct or class, but it also seems like there are other things that require this. 

As well, how do I make sense of when brackets are needed in calling items in code? 

Any help here would be greatly appreciated.","I'm still lost: Sometimes swift calls for dot notation, and sometimes it calls for brackets. How do I know which will be expected? Is there a rhyme or reason to this?"
2409,1209,2020-09-11 16:11:18,0,1,"I am trying to perform user registration with Firebase. I have it set up, but I want know what best practice is when handling errors inside of completion handlers. 

I have an enum with the different types of errors that Firestore can throw when a user is being created. I had to add a 'none' case because I was instantiating the error variable outside of Auth.auth(), so I needed a 'none' to allow me to initialize it before the Auth.auth() block in order to be able to return it from the function. This doesn't seem like the correct way to accomplish this, so I want to see if there is a better way.

    enum RegistrationError : Error{

        case emailAlreadyInUse

///
static func _create(_ req: Request) throws -&gt; EventLoopFuture&lt;Model&gt; where Model: Relatable, Model.Input: Validatable {

///
/// Save a new entry in the database
///
/// - parameters:
///     - req: Request
/// - returns:
///     - Model
///

The actual workaround is to make 2 different the method 2 and adding the single line `try Model.Input.validate(req)`.

* If user doesn't type anything in, placeholder text reappears and font color should be light gray again.

We got the keyboard part sorted. But is still struggling with changing between the light grey font color and black, and getting placeholder text to disappear when user clicks on the text view. Would appreciate some help if possible!

We largely followed Solution 1 from this Stack Overflow answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27652227/how-can-i-add-placeholder-text-inside-of-a-uitextview-in-swift). And inserted our code in viewDidLoad.

Here's our current code (we labelled our text view as addNotesBar):

    addNotesBar.text = ""Add Notes""
    AddNotesBar.textColor = UIColor.lightGray
    
    func textViewDidBeginEditing(_ textView: UITextView) {
    if AddNotesBar.textColor == UIColor.lightGray {
    addNotesBar.text = nil
    addNotesBar.textColor = UIColor.black
    }
    }
    
    
    func textViewDidEndEditing(_ textView: UITextView) {
    if addNotesBar.text.isEmpty {

We’ve been going through various resources for a month and had tried to apply them in some way for a basic app.

What we still don’t know and perhaps you can help us gain some clarity on are:

1) Let’s say we have a check-in mood questionnaire that user fills out and attach images to. User can fill out this same questionnaire whenever. When they hit the “Save” button, all the form answers should be saved somewhere/somehow so user can open that form a later time and review the answers. Can we build this “store the form answers” aspect in Xcode? What about the actual storage part? Is that built elsewhere? So we will need to hire a backend dev? (Or then struggle our way to learn that too lol)

2) If the swift files show no red warnings, no red constraints, and the simulator runs smoothly across all the devices? What are the next steps before we launch? We don’t have the physical device for all the iOS models to test. Would we build the backend then? Is best practice (if it isn’t us new leaners) suppose to build front and back ends at the same time?

We move a lot of furniture for a lady who stages high end homes for sell. We move the stuff from house to house or to storage etc. she has like 8 different storage units and they are all super packed. It makes it very difficult to find stuff sometimes and we waste a lot of time. 

I want to create a qr or barcode for each item and attach it on each item. 

Then use our phones to read the tag and be able to edit information such as location, and a picture. 

Then when she needs something we can just search for it's name or by picture etc. 

So I'm thinking easiest way would be to use a qr code library or similar to process the image, then use a database to store the info and a website to display it all out nicely.

We get no reception in the storage unit so it has to be able to store it at least locally temporarily.  


So like let's say I have all my items on the database. Say there is 15 pieces of furniture at “house 3” and I'm moving it to storage unit c. My plan was to use the app to scan the QR code of the storage unit and then scan each item going into that unit and have it automatic change the information to reflect that in the database. We move hundreds of items a day like lots of paintings etc. So it needs to be quick and automated. Can't be bothered to type the information on each item to where it moved to.

And I understand that return statements can be omitted so you can have

According to [https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/OpaqueTypes.html](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/OpaqueTypes.html)

If you have a function like this:

    func protoFlip&lt;T: Shape&gt;(_ shape: T) -&gt; Shape {

            return shape

this call would not be allowed:

    protoFlip(protoFlip(smallTriange))

And it's one of the reasons why opaque type is useful. 

But why? protoFlip takes in a parameter that conforms to Shape. 

It returns something that conforms to Shape. 

Shouldn't you be able to pass it right back in?",Why is the value of a prototype type doesn’t conform to that protocol?
2467,285,2020-10-08 17:32:41,0,1,"**I'm writing this in the swift subreddit, as i'm pretty confident that there's something wrong with my REST functionality**  


**Environments and Conditions:**

* Calling the http Cloud Function from an iOS app after I get the ID token (with the ID token)
   * Written in Swift
* The Cloud Function is written in Python
* I cannot use HTTP callables as they are not deployable via the current terraform infrastructure in place (at least not that I know of, but would be open to any ideas)

**Problem:**

So, I was under the assumption that including the Firebase ID token of a Firebase user inside of the Authorization header works ,but it hasn't been for me even with a force refresh. I get a 403 status response with message: `The access token could not be verified`. That being said, if I go into CLI and get the id token of my actual gcp user account via: `gcloud auth print-identity-token` then replace the header with said token, I am verified.

**Short term Solution:**

* added `allUsers` as members of the cloud function with role: `Cloud Function Invoker` and oddly enough `allAuthenticatedUsers` didn't work.
   * If this is the only way for it to work, then firebase id tokens are technically not equivalent to (or usable as) gcp id tokens.

1. Aren't Firebase ID tokens equivalent to Google ID Tokens?
2. Could there be an iAM permission issue for the (auto generated) firebase service account?
3. Do I need to also add any of the plist values to the idtoken when sending it over in the header?
4. Could it be something with the rules of my cloud function?
5. Am I missing something, or is this intended/expected behavior? With http callables being regular http functions but with protocols packaged to facilitate, I would think that this is a relatively easy implementation....
6. I've thought of the route of using an admin function to send a message to the mobile instance that needs a google id token during login, but the overhead and latency would result in issues.",Authenticating to a GCP HTTP Cloud Function with a Firebase ID Token doesn't work??

@IBAction func buttonPressed(print(“The button was pressed”) sender: Any) {
}

The error is coming under near the ‘print’ and says “Expected parameter name followed by ‘:’”

If anyone knows anything to do with this, I’d appreciate some help with how I can make the error go away. I’ve tried just about everything.",This seems like the right place to put this

I started my career as an iOS dev nearly during lockdown and I have lost my job now. I wanted some experienced opinion for way forward.

&amp;#x200B;

January 2020 - I had gotten an internship In January 2020.

I learned swift and the made iOS App for this particular product company which already had its Android app.

&amp;#x200B;

March 2020 - Govt declared Nation-wide lockdown and I continued working from home.

&amp;#x200B;

Mid June 2020 - The app was live and I demanded for a job offer. I was told that I will continue to get a stipend but a formal offer letter could be worked out in Mid July.

&amp;#x200B;

Mid July 2020 - I got the offer letter however, it citied a remarkably lesser salary (Nearly the stipend) With a promise of an offer nearly 3x the amount with other benefits that could be worked on later.

I was told this because of the Covid situation and it made sense to me because 1. I should be understanding of the fact that it is a world-wide economic crisis.2. I liked the idea and I made the iOS app from scratch so it was like my baby.

&amp;#x200B;

Sept 2020 - The company failed to raise more funds, I was not offered the salary that could possibly be worked upon and I continued working for the lesser pay.

I just thought I have waited enough and I should possibly give it more time because you never know something clicks and everything becomes worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

Mid Oct 2020 - ""Would not be continuing forward"" is the subject of the mail I received which mentions due to economic crisis and lack of funds the company wouldn't need my services anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no grudges for not being paid even a standard iOS dev salary as these people literally made my career amidst a global pandemic and now I have an App live on the App store.

&amp;#x200B;

I could use some help in terms of how do I proceed for a good iOS developer career?

Should I choose a product or a service company next?

Would I now get if not a job at least an internship at FAANG?

For the most part I understand swift although I'm experiencing new things like struct, closure, optional chaining etc. I have few questions regarding swiftui especially in the View. In the code below NavigationView is supposed to load with a list of items with values(address, zip, rent, type) which is returned from configureView. In the NavigationView, List has no value until onAppear is called which calls configureView. What is the sequence of execution? Does the onAppear excute after the List is loaded or does the onAppear execute async way so it returns value to the list? I'm little confused by the sequence of modifiers being executed. Same with the navigationBarTitle. It would be helpful if someone could explain it to me in easy terms. These are my codes I read and googled a lot but still feel I have some knowledge gap.

[A while ago I ask on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/i3plk4/selectable_colors_themes_to_visually_change_the_ui/) if there was a way to create selectable colors themes to visually change the UI. I kindly received an answer that suggested me to divide the colors into structs. However, this solution involved UIColor, while on my app I had to use Color.   
My idea was to implement a ColorPicker so that users could select a total of three colours for their own personlized theme. 

Is there a way to create a struct with Colors selected by users? 

If not, is there a way to convert Colors into Data so that I could save them into an array and store the infos into the Info.plist (or save it some way)?  
I read that with UIColor this part would be easier by converting them to Hex Strings, but for how I structured my app I think it would be too complicated to effectively turn all the Color into UIColor...

After watching this [https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/223/](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/223/) amazing talk and a little bit of researching at [https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/test/Prototypes/Algorithms.swift](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/test/Prototypes/Algorithms.swift) I've come with this solution:

    extension MutableCollection {
      /// - Complexity: O(n log n)
      public mutating func bringFront(elementsSatisfying predicate: (Element) -&gt; Bool) {
        self.stablePartition(count: self.count, isSuffixElement: { !predicate($0) })
      }
    }

That leads to this result:

    var array = [1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 1, 6, 7]
    array.bringFront { $0 == 1 } // [1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

So you get almost linear complexity for free 🥳

To make code above compiling you need to add few methods that you can find here [https://gist.github.com/japanese-goblinn/89342b2499b30252c9777fc40918ec0e](https://gist.github.com/japanese-goblinn/89342b2499b30252c9777fc40918ec0e)

I was surprised when on the next day swift team released [https://github.com/apple/swift-algorithms](https://github.com/apple/swift-algorithms) that contained updated version of `stablePartition` algorithm.

**The Problem:** I need to upload an image to firebase. Once uploaded, I need to return the url string where its saved to another class which then uses that string to create a post. Whats happening is the UploadImage function is being called, however the code after is completing before Upload Image can finish, thus I am creating the post with no image as the url being provided is blank.

Upload Image code:

    import SwiftUI
    import Firebase
    
    func UploadImage(imageData: Data,path: String,completion: @escaping (String) -&gt; ()){

        let metadata = StorageMetadata()
        metadata.contentType = ""image/jpeg""
        
        let randomNum = Int.random(in: 0..&lt;1000)
        
        storage.child(path).child(uid).child(String(randomNum)).putData(imageData, metadata: metadata) { (_, err) in

            storage.child(path).child(uid).child(String(randomNum)).downloadURL { (url, err) in

                completion(""\(url!)"")

        }
    }

1. not being able to **update single packages**
2. not being able to **store the downloaded packages into the project git repository** (i now it is a topic of discussion, but for delicate projects such as the ones i am working on it is fundamental to have a full picture of the codebase at any given point).

2504,1205,2020-10-27 11:22:27,0,1,"Hello,

I've been learning &amp; working on a swift app that basically allows you to have multiple ""counters"", that are synced between your devices using CoreData.

However, I'm not sure I'm doing it ""the right way"".

My main content view gets the counter list this way :

    // The class that contains the counter list
    class ObservedCounterList : ObservableObject{
        @Published var counterList = CounterObject.fetchAll()
    }
    
    // Inside my ContentView : 
    struct ContentView: View {
        
        @State var isAdding: Bool = false
        @State var isEditing: EditMode = .inactive
        
        @EnvironmentObject var observedCounterList : ObservedCounterList
        ...
    }

The problem is that using this, I can't use any preview provider because it cannot gets data from CoreData.

Here is the CounterObject.fetchAll() method : 

    
    class CounterObject : NSManagedObject {
        
        static func fetchAll(viewContext: NSManagedObjectContext = AppDelegate.viewContext) -&gt; [CounterObject] {
            let request : NSFetchRequest&lt;CounterObject&gt; = CounterObject.fetchRequest()
            request.sortDescriptors = [NSSortDescriptor(key: ""name"", ascending: true)]
            guard let tasks = try? viewContext.fetch(request) else {
                return []
            }
            return tasks
        }
    ...
    } 

As it is a NSManagedObject, I can't create a dummy CounterObject that I would use for the preview (as far as I know?)

What would be a better way to structure this kind of app ?

Why does calculating this class variable this particular way in a View stop background processing on my Apple Watch after 60 seconds, but not in the simulator?

I start with a simple example from Apple, meant to demonstrate HealthKit on an Apple Watch.  The source is [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/workouts_and_activity_rings/speedysloth_creating_a_workout).

The app shows a Timer, using HealthKit to allow background processing so the app can keep running.

This is apple's code which keeps the Timer chugging in the background on a real apple watch:

        // WorkoutManager.swift
    
        // Set up and start the timer.
        func setUpTimer() {
            start = Date()
            cancellable = Timer.publish(every: 0.1, on: .main, in: .default)
                .autoconnect()
                .sink { [weak self] _ in
                    guard let self = self else { return }
                    self.elapsedSeconds = self.incrementElapsedTime()
    
                    // added by me to make sure the background process is continuing
                    print(self.elapsedSeconds)
    
                }
        }
    
        // Calculate the elapsed time.
        func incrementElapsedTime() -&gt; Int {
            let runningTime: Int = Int(-1 * (self.start.timeIntervalSinceNow))
            return self.accumulatedTime + runningTime
        }
    // WorkoutView.swift
    ...
        var body: some View {
            VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                // The workout elapsed time.
                Text(""\(elapsedTimeString(elapsed: secondsToHoursMinutesSeconds(seconds: workoutSession.elapsedSeconds)))"").frame(alignment: .leading)
                    .font(Font.system(size: 26, weight: .semibold, design: .default).monospacedDigit())
    
    ...

`self.elapsedSeconds` is handed off to a View, `WorkoutView`, and updates the view regularly, and the background processing continues to work.

If I add my own variable, with very simple logic and try to show it in the `WorkoutView`, it will continue to update for about 60 seconds (give or take) in the background, and then stop background tasks.  If the watch's screen is awoken, the counting down continues, but once the screen is asleep again, the background processes stop.

    
    // WorkoutManager.swift
    ...
        @Published var timeLeft: Int = 2000
    ...
    
        // Set up and start the timer.
        func setUpTimer() {
            start = Date()
            cancellable = Timer.publish(every: 0.1, on: .main, in: .default)
                .autoconnect()
                .sink { [weak self] _ in
                    guard let self = self else { return }
                    self.elapsedSeconds = self.incrementElapsedTime()
    
    // my added variable timeLeft
                    self.timeLeft -= 1
                    print(self.timeLeft)
                }
        }
    
    // WorkoutView.swift
    
    ...
                Spacer().frame(width: 1, height: 8, alignment: .leading)
    
                Text(""Time Left: \(workoutSession.timeLeft)"")
            }
            .frame(minWidth: 0, maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 0, maxHeight: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
        }
    ...
    

I'm wondering why if the changing variable is set up the way Apple has shown, background taks continue, but if I make a variable in a different way, it stops the background tasking.

Everything can be replicated from the [sleepy sloth](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/workouts_and_activity_rings/speedysloth_creating_a_workout) example given by Apple, and because I took it from that example, and have thoroughly checked, I think HealthKit is setup correctly.

I need some advices from more experienced Swift programmers.

Someone told me that it should live inside of the Firebase API, not in the app client. I am not too sure, can someone give me advice on where the algorithm should live. Also, about the language can it be done in swift?

# Purpose

I recently published my first application on the iOS App Store and would like to use this post as a good opportunity to-

* provide insight into the entire process from my perspective for anyone considering iOS App development (i.e. a post that I would share with my past self)
* describe my workflow (decision making process, tools used, etc.) so that it is open to meaningful discussion and criticism
* document my experiences for future reference

Some of the content in this post might be self-evident and at times downright trivial. This is a very intentional decision as I tried to make it as accessible as possible.

# Background

I'm an electrical engineer (and finance major) with minimal practical software development experience. Prior to the start of this project, I had a reasonable grasp of fundamental programming principles (variables, conditional statements, loops), but everything else was learnt during the project. I've briefly worked as a Site Reliability Engineer, resulting in basic competency with sysadmin tools (command line interface, version control).

# Motivation

I've been a part of the Apple ecosystem for a while and I've always been fascinated by the platform and the community around it. The idea of having my own App on the App Store motivated me for several reasons-

* it provided me an opportunity to contribute to an ecosystem that I have been a long time consumer of
* there was an inevitable prospect of solving technical and design challenges with practical utility (I was especially looking forward to dealing with user interface/user experience problems as this is something that I've not previously been involved with)  
* while not really a priority, it is difficult and naive to ignore the potential monetary compensation resulting from an App that people find useful

# Learning the Ropes

Before identifying what problem my App would solve, I chose to go through the foundations needed (grammar of the medium so to speak) to help me frame the problems that I might face before even being able to solve them. A perusal of [Swift Documentation](https://swift.org/documentation/#the-swift-programming-language) along with Apple's [App Development with Swift](https://books.apple.com/au/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996) provided me a good overview of the language and Object Oriented Programming. Playgrounds in Xcode was a very intuitive tool to explore theses concepts.

I made a decision at the stage to utilise SwiftUI in an uncompromising manner. Despite the [several issues](https://www.iosapptemplates.com/blog/swiftui/swiftui-drawbacks) present in adopting this approach, the declarative syntax of SwiftUI resonated with my mental model of UI construction (as opposed to UIKit).  The unified implementation across all iOS devices and the tight feedback loop provided by Xcode previews were additional drivers behind this decision. Apple's own [walkthrough of SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/) was insightful, but there were still several gaps in my understanding of Swift and declarative programming to fully grasp the finer details.

After gaining a reasonable understanding of Swift and SwitUI, I moved on to some self contained projects that incorporated physical devices. This also allowed me to observe how people solved problems on the platform and was some of the most fun I had during the process as I was able to explore different frameworks without much of a commitment. In addition, it helped broaden the scope of problems that I was willing to solve (while walking thought some [pretty cool projects](https://swiftui-lab.com/swiftui-animations-part1/)). Here are some of the resources used- 

* [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com)\- not much I can say about this that hasn't already been said. A really comprehensive resource for everything from small snippets to large projects
* [raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com)\- another fantastic resource, with a lot of [well rounded projects](https://www.raywenderlich.com/7738344-mapkit-tutorial-getting-started)
* [AppCoda](https://www.appcoda.com)\- a lot of useful tutorials (I found their walkthrough of [In-App Purchases](https://www.appcoda.com/in-app-purchases-guide/) especially invaluable) 
* [The SwiftUI Lab](https://swiftui-lab.com)\- for some really awesome, fun and practical SwiftUI tutorials
* [Swift by Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com), [SwiftLee](https://www.swiftbysundell.com) and [Simple Swift Guide](https://www.simpleswiftguide.com)
* [SchwiftyUI](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsgr7nAvsNLvUybqIJp3ySA) and [Azamsharp](https://www.youtube.com/user/azamsharp) for some video walkthroughs
* [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com)\- perhaps a bit tangential, but Bret has some truely insightful and [eye-opening](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/) essays on design and problem solving
* [WWDC Presentations](https://developer.apple.com/videos/)

Tools used- 

* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/desktop)\- for storing all content (apart from Xcode projects). I felt that Notion's features (ability to set custom views for databases, page links and cloud sync) along with its general layout was a good candidate for this job. I used it to schedule tasks, create generic Kanban boards, store frequently used code snippets and save visual elements of finished projects (for later review/reference) along with all the resources used.

# Value Proposition

So what problem was my App going to solve? I did not dedicate a specific time for this activity, but engaged with it passively whenever it approached me subconsciously. A few considerations that affected my decision-

* tempering my imagination by being aware of my present skillset
* taking on a problem that is not trivial- by challenging me to my limits whilst still being achievable
* be a problem that I faced in my daily usage
* ensure the problem had a target audience &gt; 1 (i.e. not something done for my own entertainment)

It's evident from the above that there are a few conflicts between my considerations, which required prioritising one over the other (eg. I placed a higher weight on problems that I faced at the expense of reducing the target audience as I anticipated that the motivation derived from solving a personal problem would be a valuable asset during moments of stagnation during the development process).

Some of you might note that I did not include a time constraint and a financial budget above, which, I would imagine would be a reasonably high priority in any project. For a lot of personal reasons, these two considerations did not affect my decision (within reason of course, eg. a project longer than 6 months would be unfeasible in this instance), which might limit the usefulness of this post. However, I believe these two elements would just be added considerations that would require prioritisation as above. 

# Investigating Competition

I decided to address the problem of visualising personal data on a map, an idea that a lot of Apps solved as an afterthought (eg. [Apple Maps](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/maps/mpsa4871840a/mac) and [Google Maps](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3184808?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&amp;hl=en) with saved locations, [Day One](https://help.dayoneapp.com/en/articles/840054-journal-views-in-day-one-for-ios) and [Apple Photos](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/ipad/ipad0352bf82/ipados) with geographic data attached to individual entries) but very few did so [intentionally](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/keeptrax-location-journal/id887857687). Investigating how existing Apps solved the problem helped me gain a concrete understanding of why someone (with the narrow use case as defined by the project) should download my App as opposed to those that I've mentioned. Investigating the competition also had the added benefit of bringing my awareness to the numerous UI elements available along with the deployment of these elements by other developers to achieve a specific task.

# Project Workflow

I choose to divide the project into major functions (eg. search bar, data persistence, map interaction, etc.) that I would prototype and then implement individually and finally integrate at the end. Individual Xcode projects were created for each of these functions. Whilst this is a piecemeal approach, I found that I was better able to concentrate on the problem at hand and also keeping the scope focused. In order to mitigate an incompatible mess, I tried to define the functions to be as independent to each other as possible. I completely acknowledge that this is not the most efficient approach and presume that this would not be feasible for a lot of projects. I'd welcome a discussion for a workflow that would keep segments of a project independent and focused while also maintaining a holistic view. 

# Prototyping

Without any real experience with UI design (and a heavy reliance on intuition), I found drawing out UI elements and creating trivial storyboards to be really helpful as- 

* they reduced the mental load of trying to place various UI elements in my head
* they helped me visualise transitions
* they reduced the potential for bias by providing a concrete visualisation as opposed to an abstract mental modal
* they were more lightweight than coding mock elements (this view might me contentions view and obviously dependant on the individual skill/preference)

My mockups usually involved trivial drawings of UI elements accompanied by text that rationalise decisions-

# Technical Implementation

A satisfactory prototype usually led to identifying how it can be implemented on device. This stage usually involved identifying relevant pre-existing frameworks (usually first party) and then implementing the functionality using the APIs within the framework. 

The specifics of this phase varied heavily with regards to the exact function that needed to be implemented, but what remained constant was the process of breaking down the problem as much as possible. Eventually, most broken down problems lead to a [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56433665/what-is-the-some-keyword-in-swiftui) post of someone who already had the same question. And yes, I was cognisant of making a genuine attempt to look up official documentations before resorting to stack overflow.

Occasionally, I would need to abandon a particular implementation for one of several reasons. For instance, implementing a translucent modal with custom gestures required significantly more engineering effort than anticipated and did not justify the value derived from the visual effect. Inability to use SwiftUI for specific tasks was another reason for reverting to the prototype stage. Resolving such a scenario usually involved simplifying the design (eg. using an opaque modal) whist still maintaining the functionality. 

This stage had that highest level of frustrations but also happened to be the most rewarding. On several occasions, I would hit what seemed like a dead end only to return later to find a solution. Seeing the pieces fall into place was exhilarating and having a problem that personally motivated me definitely helped my willingness to expend the mental energy to resolve an issue. 

For some problems, the process of solving the issue itself was rewarding and was extremely enjoyable. For other problems, it was more a matter of reaching the destination (i.e. means to an end), in which case leveraging code that other developers provided was very helpful (eg. [code](https://github.com/khuffie/swiftui-mapkit-callout) to encapsulated a SwiftUI view within a MapKit callout significantly reduced development time as my priorities were leaning more towards implementing how a callout should look, as opposed to making the SwiftUI elements compatible with MapKit). The source of frustration that I mentioned earlier arose when the problem was a means to an end and did not have an existing solution from other developers that I could leverage, requiring significant engineering effort which at times might have been misguided. I know this paragraph was a bit abstract, but I thought it was important to identify the source of enjoyment and frustration during the process.

# Bringing it all together

Until it was time to bring all the pieces together, I did not really employ any form of version control. I'd imagine this would be frowned upon, but projects so far were small enough and focused for this not to be too much of an issue (however, there were occasions when it was an issue) and worth the overhead (I understand that the process of adopting version control might be so ingrained in standard software development that it might not even be considered an overhead, but personally keeping track of checkpoints was still an overhead- I'd imagine this is a sign of a more serious systemic issue with my approach).

Xcode's standard git integration was leveraged and multiple branches were used for each of the major functions of the App (eg. map interface, menus, data persistence). However, I avoided concurrently working on multiple branches due to constant merge conflicts with the `.pbxproj` file (I was able to overcome the merge conflicts that I experienced with the help of [this](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/xcode-and-git-bridging-the-gap) article). I'd be curious to hear how others handle merge conflicts with this file (especially teams with multiple developers). Hence, the benefits of using multiple branches was not capitalised and using them did not make a practical difference to the project. However, the project ""felt"" more organised, but I'm unable to quantify or articulate how.

I've always enjoyed working visually, for which reason I could not get myself to use git in command line despite being capable (I acknowledge that there are several git flags to customise the output and make it more visual, but I'm just not driven to utilise what's fundamentally a text base interface unless absolutely necessary). Whilst Xcode provides a reasonable visual feedback for git commits, it's still restricted to individual branches. I found [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) to provide a commit history that works with my mental model of a commit chain (I'd like to emphasise that is a completely subjective view as personally, the foremost reason for using GitKraken was that it was visually pleasing).

https://preview.redd.it/kmq993bwxcy51.png?width=1218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d49ef29a6c698706ec856bc32b449221b608a75

Bringing all the elements together proved to take longer than I had anticipated. And while integrating each of the disparate pieces was definitely a source of this delay, it wasn't the main culprit. What I did not anticipate was the amount work done up until this point and the effort required to port them into a fresh project. This is a trade-off that I acknowledged at the start, but miscalculated the cost for. Despite this, I'm uncertain how I would approach this issue differently for any potential future projects and would appreciate any input. Despite the minor delay, the App was starting to resemble a release candidate with the finish line is sight.

# Admin

The App was now more or less a representation of what I envisioned it to be; so it's only a push of a button away from making it to the App Store right? Well, there is still the matter of creating a developer account, registering a business, soliciting tester feedback, creating an App icon, settling on a suitable name, creating a developer website and preparing the App for the App review process. In honesty, the following tasks were not as mentally draining as I anticipated them to be, primarily because the finish line was now in sight.

Registering for a developer account was the first piece of real administrative task within the project. The reason I did not complete this until now was that for this project specifically, there was no real need for it until the it had to be distributed via TestFlight (this is not exactly true as you need a developer account for CloudKit integration and perhaps other frameworks as well, but this was a trivial task) for beta testing (which I'll discuss below). Thanks to [this](https://www.raywenderlich.com/120-how-to-submit-an-app-to-apple-from-no-account-to-app-store-part-1) very handy tutorial, the process was fairly straightforward (with the added benefit of setting up development/distribution certificates that will come in handy down the track). I also needed to register a business for taxation purposes in my country, which was reasonably seamless as the entire process was digital (your mileage may vary based on your local requirements).

Focusing on a purely design problem was a breath of fresh air after all that time spent in Xcode. The approach I adopted was to lay out my requirements for the icon and address them individually- 

* the icon should represent the App (this requirement was so trivial, abstract and unmeasurable that I contemplated not including it here. However, it did help me set a general direction and acted as a check if I was straying too wide)
* the icon should be as simplistic as possible with regards to both the colours used and shapes deployed (this was more a result of reducing complexity due to my limited skillset)

I started reviewing my competitors and analysed what the chose to display on their icon and tried to rationalise their decisions. I then listed a set of concepts (eg. a representation of a map, indication of a bookmark, etc.) that I wanted to display and went about creating trivial sketches. An interesting observation here is that I now had several ideas of what my app should look like, but most of these subconsciously turned out to be a derivative representation of some of the apps that I analysed (resulting in a struggle to generate something that looked original). Iteration was the key here (something I'll discuss in more detail further down). Whilst I did not solicit feedback for my icon design, this is something that definitely should have been done given my limited design experience.

My criteria for the App name was to select something that broadly defined the app while also not being already used by another app. My initial approach was to brainstorm several names, and select one that fits both the above criteria to the highest degree. However, some brief research on App names led me to the concept of [App Store Optimisation](https://www.apptamin.com/blog/app-store-optimization-aso-app-name-and-keywords/). Whilst I did not completely switch directions with my approach to choosing my App name, the above article provided some handy guidelines that I tried to adopt (eg. suitable length for App names, maximisation of keyword utility, etc.). 

Tools used-

* [Procreate](https://procreate.art/ipad)\- for preliminary free hand concept sketches
* [Vectornator](https://www.vectornator.io)\- for the final vector image
* [Icon Set Creator](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/icon-set-creator/id939343785?mt=12)\- to automatically generate App icons of different dimensions as stipulated by [Apple's guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/app-icon/)

# Testing 

It's time to address the elephant in the room. Several readers would have noticed that I did not mention testing throughout the post. This is because I just did not prioritise it in the project. Despite reading the [several benefits](https://www.toptal.com/qa/how-to-write-testable-code-and-why-it-matters) of implementing testing as an integral part of the development process, I failed to dedicate time to writing tests for my code (apart from some trivial unit tests as part of my learning). In addition, the further I progressed through the project, the more I was disincentivized to spend time on writing tests as-

* I had that task of going through an ever increasing number of test cases
* I was taking time away from engineering effort that would get me closer to the release (despite being fully aware that a project containing tests with good code coverage would likely mean reduced overall development time as a result of identifying bugs earlier and ensuring future changes do not break critical features)

The combination of the above factors resulted in procrastination, which created negative cues whenever I considered writing tests. I will admit without any dispute that this aspect of the project fell short (my a big margin) of what would be considered good development practice. However, I personally felt it was a lack of incentives that drove me in this direction. I knew that I had to write tests in tandem with new functions added to the project, but falling behind even by a little margin resulted in a feedback loop that disincentivized me from writing tests. I was fortunate to not encounter any major setbacks as a result of lack of testing, but I would definitely not like to rely on chance for future projects. I welcome any feedback/suggestions/strategies  (perhaps creating a script to prevent Xcode from compiling if it detects code coverage of tests to be less than a specified percentage?) on this aspect of the project. 

I did however distribute my App via TestFlight for beta testing. Another fantastic [tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/10868372-testflight-tutorial-ios-beta-testing) from [raywenderlich.com](https://raywenderlich.com) made this process fairly streamlined. I derived a lot of value from this process in terms of adding polish to my App and also receiving feedback from individuals who were able to highlight aspects of the App that I was blind to. A few iterations of this distribution and feedback loop allowed to me to reach a stage where I was satisfied with the state of the App while acknowledging the compromises made.

# Developer Website

I was surprised to find out that all Apps required a privacy policy along with a developer website and a contact email. Fortunately for me, I already had a domain registered that I could utilise. Generating a privacy policy however, was a bit more involved, not only in terms of the content that was required, but also the format. I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/9j7jdl/where_to_generate_privacy_policy_for_ios_app/) post and followed the advice of using the [privacy policy from Overcast](https://overcast.fm/privacy) as a guide to structure my policy (as a side note, I've been a long time [ATP](https://atp.fm) listener). I also developed a product/market page, which required a non-trivial amount of effort, but helped me streamline my message for the App. All this is to say that this aspect caught me off guard and ensured that I would be cognisant of this requirement and make sure to allocate the appropriate budget (time and money) to this task in the future. 

Resources used- 

* [Hover](https://www.hover.com)\- for domain name registration (this choice was based on supporting a few of the podcasts that I listen to)
* [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com)\- for web hosting, developing my product page and privacy policy and to create an email address for my custom domain (rationale for choosing this is the same as above; there are several alternatives here that could better suit your needs)

# Release

Submitting the App for App Store review was again fairly streamlined with the help of a [previously mentioned walkthrough](https://www.raywenderlich.com/119-how-to-submit-an-app-to-apple-from-no-account-to-app-store-part-2). This more or less involved filling in a lot of information (name, keywords, description, etc.) that was already prepared. Supplying screenshots for the required devices took a surprisingly long time and I would like to hear about any tools that simplified this process. 

Apple is known to reject a sizeable proportion of first time submissions as a result of failing to adhere to its [review guiltiness](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/), and I really did not know what to expect from this process after submitting my App. I received a response within a day and my app did in fact get rejected. However, this was due to a failure to provide a demo video, which was easily remedied. After resubmitting my App, I was able to find it on the App Store the next day.

# Valuable Lessons

**Time Tracking**

I was introduced to the concept of time tracking by [CGP Grey](http://timeryapp.com) a while back, but only realised it's impact once I fully adopted it into my workflow. I can not overstate the impact that it had on my project, which was evident in analysing my output before and after adopting time tracking. Apart from creating a record for time spent on the project (which would regularly be used for financial purposes such as billing and cost analysis), time tracking more importantly-

* ensured intentionality- when a timer was set for development, I knew I purposefully chose to dedicate time for this task and nothing else. On the same token, when I set the timer for a break, I was fully able to recharge by preventing myself from thinking about development and enjoy my time off. 
* reduced distractions- I was mentally driven not to get side tracked while the timer was tracking serious development time. This was surprising as it did not even require a lot of will power that might otherwise be needed to stay focused and not get distracted. 
* provided me with a more objective reflection of my effort- while I might approximate my effort to equal a day's worth of work, the data might state that I only spent 2 hours of development. This ensured I couldn't subconsciously trick myself into believing that I spent my time efficiently and added much-needed discipline to my workflow.

Tools used- 

* [Toggle](https://toggl.com/track/)\- time tracking service
* [Timery](https://timeryapp.com)\- front end for Toggle, allowing access and customisation of timers

**Iteration**

Despite planning ahead and constantly reviewing progress, the project at times felt like a constant uphill battle. While this challenge itself acted as a motivation, confronting situations when the output did not meet my expectations was disheartening. As a concrete example, in my mind's eye, I visualised an aesthetically pleasing icon and went about implementing it. However, when I completed my first draft, the result was underwhelming to say the least- 

https://preview.redd.it/ohmnr9mygjy51.png?width=180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47c4b97c45b956fdd3d8af6b9c6d137f0e439306

However, recognising that this was a preliminary draft, identifying the foundations that could be built upon (eg. the general shape and layout) and determining improvements (eg. use of shadows and highlights to create depth) that would allow me to get closer to what I envisioned was vital in methodically recreating the design with a focus on improvement. Spending time away performing other tasks also allowed me to approach the next iteration with a mentally refreshed attitude. With a few more of these iterations, I was able to get closer to what I wanted the icon to look like-   

https://preview.redd.it/sja0en59jjy51.png?width=180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a0a9f3b070885cf806d0c2788927fe0e3a16a33

This is to say that most elements of the project are a work in progress and require constant iteration for improvement. Acknowledging this helped to focus on avenues of improvement as opposed to seeing the App as it currently exists. 

**Bigger Picture**

There were several key decision made throughout the development process that had far-reaching effects. Being cognisant of these decisions was vital to the long term feasibility of the App. I specifically want to mention this because I found that if I wasn't attuned to these decisions, the repercussions only become apparent in hindsight.  

To give another concrete example, at a certain stage in my project, I needed to determine a method to store user data. At this stage of the App, the type of data was trivial and `UserDefaults` was a straightforward mechanism to store the data. CoreData was the alternative for my particular use case, but required significantly more effort (&gt; 1 week) as I had no experience in it. I chose CoreData more so because I was interested in it, accepting the delay in implementation. This proved to be a fruitful decision as my data model evolved to become significantly more complex, contained relationships and required CloudKit integration, all of which CoreData facilitated with minimal effort once it was setup. I was fortunate here as if my interest in CoreData waned, I might have chosen to use `UserDefaults` to reduce the development time, which would have caused major obstacles in the future. 

However, ""being aware of unforeseeable consequences of a decision"" is not really an actionable or measurable approach. For my future projects, I would list all but the non-trivial decision (this would be pre-defined) and explicitly rationalise each decision and their impact on a pre-defined set of future scenarios. If available, I would also request a more experienced developer to review certain decisions. 

# Final Notes

The idea of having my own App on the App Store was on my mind for a long time and I am pleased to finally set aside the time to work towards executing this idea and seeing it through to it's completion. Like most challenges, there were a range of emotions involved and the lessons learnt were applicable even outside software development (eg. recognising the importance of  time tracking). My App still requires a lot of polish, but I like to think of it as a work in progress.

2538,2390,2020-11-14 17:01:53,9,1,"Hi 👋

I'm still a beginner when it comes to SwiftUI development but I've seen some weird behavior recently after updating to 14.2.

I had a more or less working prototype (rough around the edges but working nonetheless) of my first app. The interface relies on TabView with PageStyleTabView.

Up until iOS 14.1 I had absolutely no issues with iOS update, the app would continue working as expected. However, it completely broke when I updated to iOS 14.2. I had to wait for BigSur release to be able to debug what was happening (I didn't have the SDK). I updated yesterday and isolated the issue and here's a minimal repro:


```swift
struct Test: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(""Hello"")
        }.onAppear {
            print(""Appear!"")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var selected = 0
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TabView(selection: $selected) {
                Test()
            }
            .tabViewStyle(PageTabViewStyle())
        }
    }
}

/**
Console output received:

Appear!
Appear!
Appear!
Appear!
Appear!
Appear!
Appear!

=====
Console output expected:

Appear!
**/

```

Whatever is put in the onAppear modifier of one of the page is called multiple times, even when there's only one page. That ended up spamming my API, toggling states left and right making my app unusable.

Am I missing something obvious here? Or is this a SwiftUI bug?

        // Do some stuff with this Core Data entity

1. In a SwiftUI app, is this the proper way to add functionality to a Core Data model or is there some other ""proper"" way of doing this? I read in a few places that generally you shouldn't do something like this.
2. Does this conform to the MVC structure? The function I want to create will actually leverage a helper struct for parsing JSON in order to define default data within Core Data.

Well, I needed something mindless to busy myself with. So I furiously annotated types for three hours nonstop and then did a clean. Lo! and behold, compile time had dropped from around ~35 seconds to 0.5 seconds. No kidding. 

I'm not here to convince anyone to start annotating types, and this is of course anecdotal data (where there is [actual data](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/faster-swift-builds-leaving-type-inference-behind-dan-zinngrabe/) out there for compile times with/without type inference).

                .animation(.default)
            }

    }
    }

Then in my Content View I have this:

    import SwiftUI
    
    struct ContentView: View {
        
        @ObservedObject var dm : DataManager
        @State var searchText = """"
        @State private var isEditing = false        
        
        var body: some View {
            NavigationView {
                VStack {
                    Search(text: $searchText)
                         .padding(.horizontal, 10)
                    Form {
                        ForEach(dm.storageValues.filter({ searchText.isEmpty ? true : $0.valueName.contains(searchText) })) { data in
                            Text(data.valueName)
                        }
                    }
                    .navigationBarTitle(""Example"")
                }
            }
        }
    }

I don't know if they can be useful, but the DataManager is like this:

    import SwiftUI
    import Combine
    
    class DataManager : Equatable, Identifiable, ObservableObject {
    
    static let shared = DataManager()
    
    @Published var storageValues : [ValueModel] = []
    typealias StorageValues = [ValueModel]
    
    //The rest of the code
    } 

With the ValueModel that is like this:

    import SwiftUI
    import Combine
    
    class ValueModel : Codable, Identifiable, Equatable, ObservableObject, Comparable {
    
        var id = UUID()
        var valueName : String
        var notes : String?
        var expires : Date?
        
        init(valueName: String, notes: String?, expires: Date?) {
            self.valueName = valueName
            self.notes = notes
            self.expires = expires
        }
    }

I used a custom binding on the textfield to call the api func whenever the text is changed.

I know ads are still being served because I tested it on my brother's phone. Another thing to note is that I only show ads after an AWS lambda function is called.

In the past month, my api has been called at least 600-800 times everyday.

It’s been a year since then, and I’m here to say that I’ve learned so much about coding, and I can pickup languages to learn quickly. As a stats student, i had learned R and python for data science+mL. However, the one language that really got me hooked to programming was SwiftUI for iOS dev. I remember I had followed the 100 days of swift course by Paul Hudson and the logic was all flowing together nicely for me. However, I ended up giving up on my journey. Whenever I would hop into making my own apps with swiftUI, I’d always run into issues with how I can make my apps more complex, mainly because I didn’t know how to bridge the gap between swiftUI and UIKit. I want to retry learning swift and iOS dev, as learning it was so much fun. I want to ask you all, should I go back and learn swift, and UIKit to get the fundamentals down? I feel as thought my knowledge was limited when I jumped straight into swiftUI as a lot of the code that was used to bring parts of UIKit into swiftUI looked quite confusing to me.

I have a general familiarity with Python and Arcade scripting, and I have reviewed several documents on the Swift syntax. I have even taken some tutorial videos over on Lynda.com . 

However, everything I have seen just sort of glosses over, or rather doesn't introduce at all the basic document structure of how apps are built in Xcode. I can't really find any good tutorials that explain what the ViewControllers are. What is the AppDelegate vs SceneDelegate? How do these documents work with each other and work together?

&amp;#x200B;

It starts by having me drag a visual effect view  with blur onto my story board and placing it at the bottom(done)

Then it has me pin the VFX view leading trailing and bottom edges to super view (done)

next it has me drag a horizontal stack view from library to VFX view.(done)

After that it has me open add new constraints and config constraints ,im assuming for the stack view, as 8 for top and bottom and 0 for leading trailing, and 50 for height(done)

I can adjust the leading and trailing just fine, however when I start the bottom constraint and switch it, the constant is set to 34. I set it to 0 then it goes way below the screen, so instead of going straight to 0 I click the up arrow one by one. each number moves my layout smoothly until I hit 34 then it skips higher up the screen.

I have just completed day 12 of 100 days of SwiftUI by HackingWithSwift. Today (and yesterday, I take it slow and do a lot of reading on the side to really grasp the full potential) I've learned a lot about optionals. I really like the way swift handles missing data. The amount of specific syntax on how to handle optionals is a bit overwhelming at first though.

Wanted also to get back to closures here real quick. Having done the basics and knowing a bit more. Now I know why closures reminded me of what I read about protocols a while ago. Closures require a specific input and output type, but you don't need to be more specific when you say that this function takes such a closure as parameter. That's what reminded me of protocols. Protocols require the existence of certain properties and methods, but not more (unless you extend them).

        self.coordinator = coordinator
        self.presenter = presenter
    }
}
```

We can gather all of these dependencies into a single object, making the initializer much cleaner.

```swift
struct Injector {
    let router: Routable = Router()
    let coordinator: Coordinatable = Coordinator()
    let presenter: Presentable = Presenter()
}

struct Controller {
    // ...

    init(injector: Injector) {
        self.router = injector.router
        self.coordinator = injector.coordinator
        self.presenter = injector. presenter
    }
}
```

### 2. Abstract to a protocol

Having a concrete type removes our code seam to inject fakes or mocks when under test. To regain it let's abstract the injector to a protocol. Then our test suite can use its own fake representation.

```swift
protocol Injectable {
    var router: Routable { get }
    var coordinator: Coordinatable { get }
    var presenter: Presentable { get }
}

struct FakeInjector: Injectable {
    let router: Routable = FakeRouter()
    let coordinator: Coordinatable = FakeCoordinator()
    let presenter: Presentable = FakePresenter()
}

let injector = FakeInjector()
let controller = Controller(injector: injector)
// ...
```

### 3. Make all variables lazy

This ensures each dependency is created only when needed. There's performance benefits to this approach and it handles dependencies that depend on the injector.

```swift
class Injector: Injectable {
    lazy var router: Routable { Router() }()
    lazy var coordinator: Coordinatable { Coordinator() }()
    lazy var presenter: Presentable { Presenter() }()
}
```

### BONUS

I’ve been using some version of this approach on all my projects since I discovered it. It’s concise, has a very small surface area, and all without third-party code.

I wrote a bit more about the benefits of DI with more sample code on my blog, [Masilotti.com](https://masilotti.com/swift-dependency-injection/). I also tweet about Swift, testing, and Ruby on Rails on Twitter: [@joemasilotti](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti).

Hi!

I just published a [new tutorial](https://blckbirds.com/post/custom-tab-bar-in-swiftui/). In this one, we will learn how to create a fully customized tab bar using SwiftUI. The tab bar will also include an animated floating menu.

By the way: we will not use a UITabBarController for this but implement the navigation logic only with SwiftUI and from scratch.

I'm hoping to install Swift on Debian 10. I've followed a couple tutorials that basically wget the Ubuntu package, unzip it, copy it to somewhere known, then add the bin folder to the path. That's all done.

Where I'm running into problems is pretty much where I thought I would: the dependencies. When I run ""swift --version"", I get the following two errors:

```
swift: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.26' not found (required by swift)
swift: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by swift)
```

I've done enough searching for the first error to know that I'm out of my depth in solving it, and I'm guessing the second will be the same. The problem seems to be that Debian 10 doesn't have the exact version of libstdc++ that Swift needs, but when I try to install libstdc++, I'm told my version is up to date.

To answer the obvious question (i.e. why am I not just using Ubuntu), we use Debian for all our servers at work. I'm setting up Swift on our new development server to see if I can, and to give me something to play with during down time. Besides, between the work servers and Raspberry Pis at home running Raspian, I'm most comfortable with Debian.

If this is doable, does anyone know how? If it's more trouble than it's worth, I'd like to know that, too. Thanks for any input.",Installing Swift on Debian 10?

I'm curious how to escape ""completion hell"". There seems to be this fundamental design in Swift were everything uses a closure/completion-handler/callback and I can't figure out how to escape this trap.

Here's what I'm trying to do (psuedocode):

    let results = loadResultsFromCache();
if results = nil {
  results = loadResultsFromURL();
}
updateUI(results) // Updates text of several NSTextFields in self (ViewController)

Hell stems from that `loadResultsFromURL` call which uses a `urlSession.dataTask` to fetch the data from a URL, which requires a closure to be used. This spirals out of control into something like this:

    loadResultsFromCache() { resultA in
  select resultA {
    case .success(let results):
      updateUI(results)
    case .failure:
      print(""Failed cache"")
      loadResultsFromURL() { resultB in
        select resultB {
          case .success(let results):
            updateUI(results)
          case .failure(let rpcFail):
            print(""Failed URL \(rpcFail)"")
            }
          }
      }
    }

What seems so simply accomplished in Go/PHP/Python (the psueocode), seems horribly complicated in Swift.

Alternatively, if this isn't possible, is there a way I could **re-route incoming calls to be answered, by default**, through a CallKit app. For instance, say I have a CallKit app called ""callkitphone"" and someone calls me from their house phone (not even knowing that the ""callkitphone"" app exists). Would it be possible for me to accept their call through my callkitphone custom app?

If not, is there any way I could modify my in-built native functionality for answering phone calls from people who are not using my CallKit app?

2673,608,2021-01-02 01:09:39,13,1,"Hi everyone, 

I think I understand what each of these are for and the basics of how they work,  but I'd really like it if someone could correct me as needed.  All feedback appreciated as I'm completely self-taught and trying to learn while working full-time and maintaining other parts of my life.


* **Initializers:** Initializing the properties of a class for example effectively sets the properties and methods to a point of nil until they contain data. This is needed due to memory issues. I think that's right? Basically it means that when a new piece of data gets put in, there's minimal chance of it having an issue of conflict when the code runs. 


* **Protocols:** These are used when I need my class, struct or enum to have specific properties or methods. A protocol can require the initialization of these things as well. I know that you can call a protocol at the point of calling a class, and that you can stick a protocol to several classes or structs.


* **Delegates:** Delegation is a design pattern, that's used to allow one thing to handle other parts of code. I think that's why delegation as a design pattern is used sending data from point-a to point-b. Admittedly this is the one thing that evades me the most on this list, as I'm still unsure of how delegates and protocols work so tightly together. I know there's parts of swift that have delegates in their calls, like UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate, but they are an *idea* to be used as a tool to get things done. Is this all correct or?

* **Closures:** I left these till the end as they're the thing I haven't really studied a lot. I think they're like a cross between functions and data-types that you can pass around.

Ok. I've been pretty absent from coding for the last month and a bit as I needed to develop the storyboards for my project and handle everything else in my life, so I'm sorry if this is all wrong. 

I hope I got some of it right. 

Thank you.","I think I understand the basics of the following concepts, but could really use some feedback: initializers, protocols, delegates, closures."

Hey guys! Reposting with mod permission

While on leave, and as a personal exercise, I've been trying to replicate a very barebones Vuex-like store implementation, inspired by [this post](https://dev.to/sadick/how-does-a-minimal-vuex-implementation-look-like-3eee). Keep in mind my knowledge of Swift is very basic, since I'm self-learning.

So far, I've come up with the following:

    typealias State = [String: Any]
    typealias Action = (_: Any?) -&gt; Void
    typealias Mutation = (_: inout State, _: Any?) -&gt; Void
    
    protocol StoreFunctionality {
        var state: State { get }
        var mutations: [String: Mutation] { get }
        var actions: [String: Action] { get }
        
        func dispatch(_ name: String, _ payload: Any?) -&gt; Void
        mutating func commit(_ name: String, _ payload: Any?) -&gt; Void
    }
    
    struct Store: StoreFunctionality {
        var state: State
        var mutations: [String : Mutation]
        var actions: [String : Action]
    
        func dispatch(_ name: String, _ payload: Any? = nil) {
            if let action = self.actions[name] {
                action(payload)
            }
        }
        mutating func commit(_ name: String, _ payload: Any? = nil) {
            if let mutation = self.mutations[name] {
                mutation(&amp;self.state, payload)
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Stuff to try with the Store struct
    
    let state = [""count"": 0]
    let mutations = [
        ""increment"": { (state: inout State, payload: Any?) in
            state[""count""] = state[""count""] as! Int + 1
        },
        ""setTo"": { (state: inout State, payload: Any?) in
            state.updateValue(payload as! Int, forKey: ""count"")
        }
    ]
    var myStore = Store(state: state, mutations: mutations, actions: [:])
    print(myStore.state[""count""]) // Optional(0)
    myStore.commit(""increment"")
    print(myStore.state[""count""]) // Optional(1)
    myStore.commit(""setTo"", 20)
    print(myStore.state[""count""]) // Optional(20)

So, I have several questions:

* I used a protocol to enforce read-only state, mutations, and actions. Is there any difference between this and `private(set)`? Is there any advantage to using protocols in the long term?
* Using a dictionary for state means optionals are being returned. I can't think of a way to always return the unwrapped value instead, any ideas?
* Dispatch isn't working at the moment, because I need to provide the store state and mutations, but every way I tried, it results in so much spaghetti code. I'm sure there's a nice, elegant way of doing it, but as I said, I'm just starting to learn Swift.

**UPDATE 2**: I'm now trying delegation (not yet committed to Github.) I don't understand it very well, but it seems to fit my use case. Thoughts?

2680,601,2021-01-04 05:25:16,7,1,"Hi Everyone, 

I'm following along with a [Paul Hudson video](https://youtu.be/7HgbcTqxoN4?t=680) about the use of the Coordinator Pattern. It's from the beginning of 2019, so about two years old.  It also references this [post](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/71/how-to-use-the-coordinator-pattern-in-ios-apps).

In it he calls for the following code in a class called **Main Coordinator**:
    
        func start() {
            let vc = ViewController.instantiate()
            navigationController.pushViewController(vc, animated: true)
        }

The ViewController subclasses from UIViewController. The problem however is that 'instantiate' does not seem to exist.  As said here in red band: *Type 'ViewController' has no member 'instantiate'*.

If I just use 'ViewController' with out the '*.instantiate' will that give me the desired result or no? It *does* seem to run the app, although I'm missing what I think is a bar or some such towards the top. In mr Hudson's video he has a line towards the top of his, so I'm just wondering if I've lost something here?

I feel like this instantiate issue might be a call back to older versions of swift, but searching online does not seem to return any info.  In fact it just seems to not show much of 'instantiate' at all. 

I've also tried using 'InstantiateViewController' in its place and that doesn't seem to work either. Again, the very word 'instantiate' does not seem to show up. 

Can someone please advise on this?  As well, what is/was instantiate to be used for?



Thank you kindly!",Has the idea of instantiate been pulled from Swift over the last two years? Trying to make sense of a Paul Hudson video.

I'm trying to learn the Coordinator Design Pattern from this Paul Hudson [tutorial](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/71/how-to-use-the-coordinator-pattern-in-ios-apps). [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HgbcTqxoN4) is the video version of that tutorial. 

When I completed the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HgbcTqxoN4) version, I realized that there was no visible navigation 'field/space' near the top. I seem to think that this field indicates that the presented view is a navigation controller, so I find it weird that it's not there. As well, the buttons don't seem to do anything but click- There is no action after them. I wonder if they'd work if I could get the UINavigationView to work?

After feeling puzzled by this I tried the written version. When this was completed though, I just get a blank white screen for a moment, then black, and then it crashes. Again, no nav view that I can see or make sense of. 

I've compared my code in both tutorials to the code in Mr Hudson's video and post, and I'm 99% sure it's correct.  Because of this, I keep thinking this isn't code specific, but might have something to do with the 'admin' section or moreover the world of storyboards, not necessarily code. For example, in the written version, there's an indication to unselect the ""Is Initial View Controller"" for the ViewController view. There's also instruction indicating to remove ""Main"" under the info.plist in StoryBoard name.   

Is there anyone out there familiar with this type of design pattern, or someone that could help me understand where I went wrong?  I will try to get these two projects on github tomorrow morning. 

Any help is greatly appreciated!

What I can't understand wrap my head around is the first network request will return basic info JSON for all 15 coffee shops (id, name, address). Now after obtaining the 15 IDs, I need to make a separate request for venue details which include the other half of needed data (photo and rating).

So I start to program with swift, I come from 2D game development, and i would like to create a little tool for works and for learning purposes in swift.

Basically i've been browsing the documentation for days, and I've come across Swift UI, UiView, everything related to Metal, Quartz2D, Core Graphics and I'm lost in the tools and how to implement it in swift.

So here's what I would like to do in order of importance and if you can help me with some examples code that'll be very appreciated :)

1. Creating a new canvas each time a + icon is triggered (IBAoutlet seems good but i don't know how to create a new canvas after that: do i need to create a new uiview, swiftui or a CAshapelayer?)
2. Having those new canvas being selectable in a dropdown menu, let's called it ""layer"", when the icon of that dropdown menu is triggered
3. Having the possibility to create different brushes (I've already figured out how to trace a line, but i don't know how can i apply texture to it) like a pencil, an airbrush, an ink brush
4. I would like to read in order the different canvas created (it's a little tool for me to help me create animations for video game) when a play button is triggered.

2696,264,2021-01-07 17:12:50,2,1,"I've just built an \[iOS chat app([https://github.com/ClusterDB/RChat)\]](https://github.com/ClusterDB/RChat)]) using SwiftUI, Realm, and Realm Sync. I decided on a chat app as it makes an interesting case study for designing a data model and controlling who can access what data:

* A chat message needs to be viewable by all members of a chat room and no one else.
* New messages must be pushed to the chat room for all online members in real-time.
* The app should notify a user that there are new messages even when they don't have that chat room open.
* Users should be able to observe the ""presence"" of other users (e.g., whether they're currently logged into the app).
* There's no limit on how many messages users send in a chat room, and so the data structures must allow them to grow indefinitely.

https://i.redd.it/r6gv4vaf0y961.gif

Because this app's data model (and the decisions taken when designing) serve as a great starting point for many different types of apps, I wrote it up in this [HowTo article](https://developer.mongodb.com/how-to/realm-swiftui-ios-chat-app).

I've been working through a two-year old tutorial from [Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/71/how-to-use-the-coordinator-pattern-in-ios-apps). When I go to run the simulator, [this](https://i.imgur.com/a5uxfUZ.png) is what I'm expecting to see. Although [this](https://i.imgur.com/qydOkZW.png) is what I'm getting. 

So it's using the iPhone 12 simulator, but it's outputting what I think is from an older iPhone view?  I have verified that under coordinator simulator test that it reads iPhone 12.

I have tried over these last couple of days to research this, and I'm not seeing any indication online, SO or otherwise, for a fix here. 

My hunch is that this has *something* to do with the SceneDelegae and its windows properties. I have tried to search through this, but keep coming up blank. Or that is has something to do with the split from AppDelegate to SceneDelegate. 

Can someone please advise what's happened here so I can fix?

I'm reading through this (very insightful) blog post about some of the pitfalls of Protocols: [https://dmtopolog.com/pitfalls-of-protocol-extensions/](https://dmtopolog.com/pitfalls-of-protocol-extensions/)  


And in the **Changes to Function Signature** section, he gives a code example:  


    protocol NewsProvider {    
        func fetchNews() -&gt; [News]
        func applyFilter(filter: Filter)
    }
    
    extension NewsProvider {    
        func applyFilter(filter: Filter) {
            // default implementation
        }
    }
    
    struct RussiaTodayNewsProvider: NewsProvider {
        func applyFilter(filter: Filter) {
            // specific implementation
        }
    }

and then he goes on to make the following change:  


    extension NewsProvider {    
        func applyFilter(filter: Filter, removeFakeNews: Bool = false) {
            // default implementation
        }
    }

where he then claims that if you make a change to the required method signature in either the Protocol implementation or the Extension, that the compiler should catch that and make sure that both the Protocol and Extension's **Required Method** signature are aligned, and any type that you have conforming to this Protocol and have your own specific implementation for would **NOT** receive an error.   


When I try this out in a playground, if I change the method signature of the Protocol method, I find that the compiler is not requiring my required method signature and default implementation signature to be the same, but rather that my protocol and conforming type's function signature are aligned as one would expect. And in turn, the method declared in the extension is then treated as ""additional functionality"" as the author of the above article puts it.   


Similarly, any changes I make to the method in the protocol extension do not raise any issues  for the method signature in my Protocol and conforming type, and again treats whatever change I made to the protocol extension's method as its own additional functionality, rather than a default implementation for my protocol's method.

# FAQ:

**Should I use SwiftUI or UIKit?**

The answer to this question depends a lot on personal preference. Generally speaking, both UIKit and SwiftUI are valid choices and will be for the foreseeable future. 

SwiftUI is the newer technology and compared to UIKit it is not as mature yet. Some more advanced features are missing and you might experience some hiccups here and there. 

You can mix and match UIKit and SwiftUI code. It is possible to integrate SwiftUI code into a UIKit app and vice versa.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is X the right computer for developing Swift?**

Basically any Mac is sufficient for Swift development. Make sure to get enough disk space, as Xcode quickly consumes around 50GB. 256GB and up should be sufficient. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Can I develop apps on Linux/Windows?**

You can compile and run Swift on Linux and Windows. However, developing apps for Apple platforms requires Xcode, which is only available for macOS.

&amp;#x200B;

**Is Swift only useful for Apple devices?**

No. There are many projects that make Swift useful on other platforms as well. You can use Swift on the Server with frameworks such as [Vapor](https://vapor.codes). Furthermore, [TensorFlow supports Swift](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift), so you can write deep learning models in it. Lastly, there are efforts to [make Swift available on embedded systems](https://github.com/swift-embedded/swift-embedded).

2732,3453,2021-01-19 23:38:33,1,1,"Hi Everyone, 

I've been working through [this](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/71/how-to-use-the-coordinator-pattern-in-ios-apps) Paul Hudson tutorial to acquaint myself with the coordinator pattern. I've completed the tutorial and got it to work. 

Now I'm trying to apply that type of design pattern to my own project.  In this project I have several storyboards that all contain different view controllers in each.  

When I try to replicate the Paul Hudson tutorial in my own project, I'm greeted with *""Storyboard (&lt;UIStoryboard: 0x6000030a1e00&gt;) doesn't contain a view controller with identifier 'OptionsViewController'""*. In my project I believe that I've got everything setup properly, but it keeps giving me this error.

I'm in no way asking for someone to fix what's wrong, but I'd love it if I could know whether I'm on the right track here. 

So... I *think* it's not working because the VC that the coordinator is trying to access is in a *different* storyboard. Otherwise I've been using the Paul Hudson tutorial pretty closely to my own project, so I don't know what else it could be.  [This](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/ios-coordinators-a-storyboard-approach) article seems to do an ok job of outlining how to use the coordinator pattern with multiple storyboards.   

Am I close here?

So I need to create a func that returns an object from two textfields. This is what I came up with and it works:

            return nil
        }
        guard let calories = caloriesTextField.text else {
            return nil
        }
        let caloriesInt = Int(calories)
        guard let finalInt = caloriesInt else {
            return nil
        }
        return Food(name: name, calories: finalInt)
    }

This works just fine, but I don't quite understand why I need to unwrap the calories value twice. I originally attempted to do it this way: 

    func logFood() -&gt; Food? {
        
        guard let name = foodTextField.text else {
            return nil
        }
        guard let calories = caloriesTextField.text else {
            return nil
        }
        return Food(name: name, calories: Int(calories))
    }

This returns an error. Xcode tells me that I need to unwrap calories again after converting it to an Int. I'm a little unsure about why that is necessary since I just unwrapped the calories String. Shouldn't I simply be able to convert the unwrapped calories to an Int? Why do I need convert it to an Int and then unwrap it before using it?

I have written a generic grid component for drag sorting and filtering. One of the feature is it shows a specified view when the result set from the FetchRequest is empty. It all work well except for on use case. If the grid has an item in it, then I delete this item to put the grid into its empty state, it freezes the app both in the simulator and on device. This is consistently reproducible. I  have isolated the issue to a line of code that is a conditional check is ""result.isEmpty"" (also tried results.count == 0 to the same effect). When I remove this line (which iterates over an empty result set) it works fine. However the code executes with no issue and there is no crash. Just a freeze. 

Instrumentation does not offer up too much insight either and there is no indications that my code is looping or locking. (Well as far as I can tell)

2753,3154,2021-01-28 17:30:46,3,1,"Naming things is hard. And naming tests is no exception. But XCTest adds another layer of complexity: test names have to be functions.

The framework creates a test for every function that starts with “test” in your `XCTestCase` subclass. Examples from [Apple’s docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/defining_test_cases_and_test_methods) include:

```swift
class NetworkReachabilityTests: XCTestCase {
    func testUnreachableURLAccessThrowsAnError()
    func testUserJSONFeedParsing()
}
```

I find these a bit hard to understand. Humans weren’t meant to read camel case, that’s why we have spaces! I would much rather write tests like Kotlin, as a string.

```kotlin
class MyTestCase {
     @Test fun `number of cells with no data is zero`()
}
```

Turns out, we can get something very close to this Swift, but there are a few tradeoffs. Add the following extension to your test suite.

```swift
extension XCTestCase {
    func test&lt;T&gt;(_ description: String, block: () throws -&gt; T) rethrows -&gt; T {
        try XCTContext.runActivity(named: description, block: { _ in try block() })
    }
}
```

We are taking advantage of [`XCTActivity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctcontext) to wrap everything in “test” with some syntactic sugar. Now we can write tests like this!

```swift
class TestCase: XCTestCase {
    func test_numberOfCells() throws {
        test(""is zero when there is no data"") {
            /* ... */
        }

        test(""is equal to the number of items"") {
            /* ... */
        }
    }
}
```

I really like how this reads. It’s obvious what’s going on and each assertion gets its own space to breath. However, there are a few downsides to this approach.

### How do you test?

Looking ahead, I’d love to create a micro-library that can generate tests on the fly. Think Quick, but without any of the nesting or BDD stuff.

What do you use to test your Swift code? Do you use any third-party libraries? I’d love to know! [Mention or DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti) to get in touch.

2758,2317,2021-01-31 12:13:44,33,75,"I'm sure you're all as excited as I am for the myriad of changes which are going to make Swift into a great language for concurrency and asynchronous programming – from async/await, to structured concurrency, to actors and actor isolation, it's all very exciting. But many of us have already gone through a paradigm shift in asynchronous programming, which came in the form of Combine (yes, I know RxSwift came before, but it wasn't as widely-used). I've been wondering, how will Combine evolve with these new concurrency features?

One possibility is that nothing changes in the public Combine API, only under the hood – so instead of making threads in C++, Combine would make them using Swift's upcoming `async let` syntax, and possibly use actors instead of locking the thread. But nothing would change for us, the users.

Another possibility is that Combine actually deprecates, or at least changes, certain things. Take `Future`, for example. Isn't that just there because we don't have `async/await`? Once we do have `async/await`, will Future's disappear, and will we instead to use `withUnsafeContinuation` and `withUnsafeThrowingContinuation` to interface with completion closures and such? But then how would we interact with all the operators – would it return a `Just`?

It's difficult to guess how Combine will change, especially since it specialises in streams of values, while the current proposals are more centred on concurrent tasks which return once (we'll have to keep a close eye on [async sequences](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0298-asyncsequence.md) though).

```c++
struct dataStruct {

} dataRCV;

2766,2309,2021-02-02 15:10:17,0,6,"#### 1. Use `XCTUnwrap` instead of force wrapping optionals

Force unwrapping a nil will cause the test suite to completely crash, meaning no output or reporting. `XCTUnwrap` provides a nice failure message and fails the test.

#### 2. Set `continueAfterFailure` to `false`

If you have multiple assertions in a test they might increase in specificity. The first asserts the size of the array and the second assets the first element. You don't want to run the second if the first fails, it's just noise.

#### 3. Use KVO observing asynchronous expectations
Use XCTKVOExpectation to assert KVO-compliant properties on your subject under test.

```swift
let expectation = keyValueObservingExpectation(for: subject, keyPath: ""property"", expectedValue: value)
wait(for: [expectation], timeout: 1)
```

#### 4. Assert types with `XCTAssert` and `is`

This technique is helpful when you only care about the type and not a particular instance.

```swift
XCTAssert(controller.presentedViewController is CustomViewController)
```

#### 5. Keep `XCTAssertEqual` parameter order consistent

The documentation doesn't indicate if the expected or actual value should be first. Pick one and stick with it to make it obvious which is which for any test. (Personally, I put the actual value first.)

#### 6. Extract helpers judiciously

If I need 3 or more lines of code to ""do something"" I extract it to a helper. This includes test setup, the action, and the assertion(s). Define the function with `#filepath` and `#line` to pass along test failures to the caller.

Bear in mind I am not a developer, but a product developer seeking advice on what best solution to take.

I'm looking to create a PHP based SaaS which will have an app for iOS+android ad responsive website for mob, tab and desktop. 

Early on, I'll create the MVP (minimum viable product) for web using responsive so all devices are supported, likely using laravel+MySQL or similar for backend. Then something like vuejs/react/ for front end. **This will be a working service at that point.**

I will then use a low cost wrapper to get it into the two app stores using (react, ionic, capacitor etc)..., creating all necessary API's. It won't be a high-performing app but it will support push notifications and have app-presence.

Then, if the project is successful after 12-24 months, I would like to hire a swift, objective programmer who can create the iOS app - **and the key here is - ideally using the same API's** as created before, so that:

\- They don't have to ask for any new API's to be created as they all exist (e.g. pulling product info..)  
\- No backend programming is required on the app itself, it is just communicating with API's  
\- I partly have saved time/done some of the work by creating these API's

I may be totally out of the loop here as I'm not familiar with much of this area, so I'd appreciate any developer who has a good understanding of creating apps for both web and native, especially in regards to using API's for pulling in data.

i´m pretty new to swift and have a Problem for which i seem not to find a solution by myself. 

Scenario: 

I want a Data Structure that should be ""open"" for Userside editing and appending.   
As Example: 

I have a list of Devices each Device has a few properties assigned to it structure looks like this... : 

   \- Computer  
\- Year  
\- OS   
\- Technical Data  
\- CPU  
\- RAM   
\- Room  
\- Office  
   \- Smart Speaker  
\- Manufacturer   
\- Room  
\- Bedroom  
\- Kitchen 

and so on - hope this visualizes my needs. 

By fully extendable and Editable I mean that the User can freely add or remove Devices - can also append for example Rooms and so on. 

Now I´m not sure how to build the Data Structure that could handle this. 

I was thinking on creating a class / struct and create objects for each device with the named propertys but then a user would not be able to add a new device on his own since the Objects are pre defined. 

After googling i thought about a Dictionary which contains all the needed Key Value Pairs but still I´m not sure if this is the right thing to go? 

Also I´m not sure if Dictionary would be ok in how to implement this in a useful way. 

Another need would be to iritate through all Devices and for example show every Device that is assigned to Bedroom for example.  

I really can´t think on a way on how to achieve this so input would be really appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

I am finding Swift really hard to learn. I want to build IOS apps (just as a hobby, I need something creative to do) and I am in the middle of HWSUI day 40 and I feel like I have just missed a bunch of information. like i can sort of grasp how something works, but i dont understand WHY a protocol needs to be included, it just seems very much ""we are going to add in this variable or protocol or whatever"" but I don't really understand WHY its included, why it works the way it does or why does it need to be included. I am finding each ""day"" takes 50% to 3x longer just because i need to go through and google how something works, and 9/10 I can't find the reason why. this is my second attempt at this and its just disheartening. I can maybe get through 30-50% of the challenges before having to google the answers!

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to take a step back and go through swift programming language on apples website in the hopes that it will help me understand, and it does, but i dont know if after reading through it will actually increase my understanding of how code works. i am kinda down to four options here:

1. go through swift programming language and jump back into day 40 of HWSUI
2. go through swift programming language and then start OVER on HWSUI and hope the connection start to be made a bit more
3. scrap Swift, go to automate the boring stuff for python to try to learn a different language and then start all over with swift.
4. realize i am just not cut out for this and scrap this pipe dream.

&amp;#x200B;

any advice you can pass along for a total noob? Honestly the times when I DO make the connection, or i am able to work through a problem or create something by myself without just googling how to do it is so satisfying, like beyond anything I experience in my day to day life.","I am finding Swift really hard to learn, and I dont know what to do"

So in theory this should be a really easy, elementary task.  There are no permission errors, but console simply produce null as the snapshot print. That is so weird.

If I test a simple snapshot to see what prints with `.child(switch).child(self.postID).child(switch)`\- it prints either 1 for true and 0 for false. So that works.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a component that's very central to the functions of the app, and doing it in 3d will significantly improve the polish of the app, so at this point I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get to a point where I can redesign it myself, if that's what needs to happen.  


A 'comprehensive' course I've been taking on swift and xcode doesn't even mention UIKit, SceneKit, or anything to do with layer transforms or 3d transforms, and it's been a long time since I've even seen a matrix, so some of this is a little over my head right now. I'm not even sure which framework will be the best for this solution either, because I know so little about the limits of each one. I've looked at the docs for an explanation of the methods and properties, but they're so vague or universal it doesn't help me at all.

So that the point which all images rotate around is actually behind the viewport(Sorry for using the wrong term I don't know where the actual origin is based on, if it's the view, or the viewcontainer, etc) in space.

TL:DR: Can you recommend resources for learning about making a 3d image carousel from scratch, one especially for beginners?

I designed this first in Godot(GDScript) and I figured it all out, but now I'm doing it in xcode and I'm running into some bumps trying to understand how swift manages OOP. I'm very new at programming in general, so bear with me as I try to explain, and if you can help, please explain as much as you can.  


In Godot, I created a class of object, instanced that object as a child under the parent 'card table' (aka view container in swift), gave it a pseudo ID (as simple as calling it '1,' or '2') and then built the scene around which card is currently in focus. Changing which card is currently in focus gives me control over a specific child of that parent 'card table,' so I can rename that cards position, move it around on the card table, and reorder the cards on the table. This was all done based on knowing that when a card is instanced, I can keep track of it dynamically without needing the actual instance ID assigned internally.  


In swift, I don't see how this can be done. I see that UIViews can have subviews added, but I haven't been able to find methods that mention children, parents, child order, referencing a child by it's sibling order, any of that. The only thing I see so far is the .subviews method for UIViews, and it looks like it treats subviews of a UIView as a collection. Is this the only way I have access to children of a UIView? How would I also change a childs position/order in relation to it's siblings?  


As a side question, is this a poor way of designing this section in swift? Is there a better way? It seems apple is pushing POP over OOP, but I don't know how I would do the same thing using protocols and delegates. Any help is appreciated!  


TLDR:  


How do I access the child of a UIView dynamically just by referencing it's position in relation to its siblings? What other methods are available that are just for dynamically accessing the children of an object by reference(either by ID, by assigning it an ID, or identifying it by some property(like metadata)?

I understand that the order you save your context then remove data is important to deleting core data and updating your view. I think the error is when the context.delete line is called, then removed with the remove(at:vocabNumber) line, saved, and then calls the loadUI function, it creates an index out of range error because the item no longer exists at that vocabNumber... How could I call my function after a word is deleted which then will load the next item in my vocabArray?

## What's GameMath?
GameMath is a cross platform cornerstone package for making 2D / 3D games and includes types like vectors, matrices, and quaternions written completely in **Swift**.

## Using GameMath
GameMath attempts to make math easier by using deliberate types and verbose naming for common tasks.

Distance is a simple function that only applies to positions.
```swift
let distance = p1.distance(from: p2) 
```
Not sure if you should subtract p1 from p2, or p2 from p1 to get a direction vector?  
Direction3 has an initializer for that.
```swift
let dirTowardP2 = Direction3&lt;Float&gt;(from: p1, to: p2) 
```
Quaternions can be created with an Euler angle style constraint, which makes creating a ""look at"" angle easier. You can just use, `.justPitch`, `.justYaw`, or `.pitchAndYaw`.
```swift
let quat = Quaternion(lookingAt: p2, from: p1, constraint: .justYaw) 
```
Degrees and Radians have their own types which eliminates confusion of which is returned or is accepted as an argument.
```swift
let quat1 = Quaternion(Degrees(90), axis: .right) 
let quat2 = Quaternion(Radians(1.5708), axis: .right) 
let quat3 = Quaternion(Radians(Degrees(90)), axis: .right) 
```
And much more...

## Check it out
https://github.com/STREGAsGate/GameMath

## Why?
This package exists because I wanted to see if I could do it. It's part of a much bigger and far more ambitious goal I have, a dream if you will. It was just a hobby and was never meant to become open source. However it turns out I can do it, and I think it's turning out pretty great. So here it is for you to enjoy too! Yay math! 😒

### More To Come
GameMath is used in my own in-development games. Check them out [here!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBXFkK2B4w9856wBJfCGufg)

Apple's own books are not up to date, hell they don't really even seem to use SwiftUI.  So I wasted my time going through their first book, until I got extremely confused on the projects being generated.

Then I went to 100 days of swift. I started doing that only to realize that was also out of date.  Fortunately, I found the website had a supposedly up to date 100 Days of SwiftUI.  So i went through all the beginning parts on the language which were actually the same as the 100 days of Swift.  I just started the SwiftUI parts, only to find it's not up to date again (at least it's using SwiftUI...)

// This is required so that when you press run my code it knows what to display.

Prior to posting this, I tried finding some answers via searching this subreddit and looking through the wiki, in which I found some, but I'm hoping I can find better answers via this post. 

Anyways, I want to get further into coding and eventually linux development. After viewing this subreddit, and other sources and places related to swift, it seems it's mainly used for app development with niche software or compatibility for other things. Because of this, I'm not sure if Swift would be write for me. I'm not sure if designing apps is my thing. I think I rather work on optimizing things and I suppose maybe apps too, or U.I, but I would like to contribute to optimizing repositories online and fixing bugs, which is a task that isn't really possible for one who's just starting to code. 

I'm thinking about just trying swift and learning a bit and seeing if I enjoy it, but I also want to pursue my skills in python or something for versatility. However, I heard it's best to stick with one language when you're just starting out to code. I guess my question or need of advice is, how should I approach this?

I have a function which returns a list of running apps. I would like to take this and put it into. So for each value returned = new item. This is a macOS app.

&amp;#x200B;

I was recently given a 2009 MacBook Air with the goal of starting to learn app development and testing. I am hoping to learn swift and flutter.

&amp;#x200B;

The operating system seems stuck at macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.6

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't seem to be able to go further than this which has led to a lot of failed initiatives like installing the minimum required versions of xcode, homebrew, appium, etc.  Everything wants 10.14 or greater it seems.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way to update past 10.13.6 or is this where the bus stops for this mac?

2958,1721,2021-05-15 14:40:19,0,1,"I am trying to create a navigation screen that will give two buttons - one that goes to a fun little game and one that goes to a part that shows me random images. I've built the random images part, but I left that out for now until I know I can make the NavigationLink stuff work. So, I'm testing it on a game I found online - link below. The code below works without errors, but when the app starts it simply jumps straight into the game. It does not give a screen with the two menu options, it does not give any option to go to the second NavigationLink, it just jumps straight into the game with no ability to navigate at all. It's almost like the code is just for the game and the NavigationLink parts don't even exist. No errors anywhere. There are other .swift files that go with the game, but none are giving any errors.

All I want is for this to start on a view with the Clouds background with 2 menu buttons. Clicking one menu button goes to the game. Clicking the other menu button goes to the random images (which will go in the ResultView2 part)

I have this idea for an app, and I have some experience with swift in the past, but I have never used certain features that I would need to in this app. I wanted to ask you guys about those features and see if they would be possible to implement. 

The app will have a few simple features. When it detects that a person pulls over while driving, it will start a recording. I will be using google speech to text API to transcribe the recording, just to detect if a conversation is occurring. The app will save the recording on the user's phone, and later the user will have the option to delete the recording if they please. 

I imagine that the first challenging part of the app would be the identification of someone pulling over. The thing is, I do not want to start a recording if they park, only if they pull over. Would this be implementable with swift? I have never used a location-based API in swift, so I don't have experience with that. 

The second challenge will probably be the recording itself. From what I have read online, recording as a background application is possible. I was mostly wondering, are there any legal implications that would stop the app from being submitted to the app store? Would the recording have to be saved in a specific location, like natively on their phone, or are there any restrictions I should know of when doing this? Also, would the phone automatically turning off stop the app from being able to detect the pulling over and recording?

If the questions are still too vague, please let me know in the comments and I will answer them in more depth.

I can't seem to find the easy question thread mentioned in the rules , sorry.

I am new to swift. But I am working on Package at the moment.

I have two questions. Does Swift support IP Addresses with cider notation. ""203.x.x.x/24"" for example.

&amp;#x200B;

1. &amp;#x200B;

Any my testing in the Playground it appears that both IPv4Address and IPv6Address do not support cidr notation.

Does anyone know of a public library that does?

2)

I was working on a simple address validation process. Very simple. I was hoping to use the IP4vAddress and IPv6Address as a simple tester.

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`

**import** Network

**extension** String {

**func** validIp4() -&gt; Bool {

**let** ip\_cidr = **self**.split(separator: ""/"", maxSplits: 1, omittingEmptySubsequences: **true**)

**if** IPv4Address(String(ip\_cidr\[0\])) != **nil** {

**return** **true**

}

print(ip\_cidr)

**return** **false**

}

**func** validIp6() -&gt; Bool {

**let** ip\_cidr = **self**.split(separator: ""/"", maxSplits: 1, omittingEmptySubsequences: **true**)

**if** IPv6Address(String(ip\_cidr\[0\])) != **nil** {

**return** **true**

}

print(ip\_cidr)

**return** **false**

}

}

**let** test = ""192.168.11.0/24""

print(test.validIp4())

**let** test2 = ""192.168.11.0""

print(test2.validIp4())

**let** test3 = ""192.1.1.301""

print(test3.validIp4())

**let** ip61 = ""2001:4860:4000::/36""

print(ip61.validIp6())

**let** ip62 = ""2001:4860:4000::""

print(ip62.validIp6())

**let** ip63 = ""2001:4860:::""

print(ip63.validIp6())

\`\`\`

This seemed to work well in the playground. But when I moved it int Xcode I got an error. Saying that IP4vAddress and IP6Address were only available in OSX 10.14. I am on 10.15 (Catalina)

So my code got changed to the following

\`\`\`

**func** validIp4() -&gt; Bool {

**let** ip\_cidr = **self**.split(separator: ""/"", maxSplits: 1, omittingEmptySubsequences: **true**)

**if** **#available**(**OSX** 10.14, \*) {

**if** IPv4Address(String(ip\_cidr\[0\])) != **nil** {

**return** **true**

}

} **else** {

// Fallback on earlier versions

}

**return** **false**

}

**func** validIp6() -&gt; Bool {

**let** ip\_cidr = **self**.split(separator: ""/"", maxSplits: 1, omittingEmptySubsequences: **true**)

**if** **#available**(**OSX** 10.14, \*) {

**if** IPv6Address(String(ip\_cidr\[0\])) != **nil** {

**return** **true**

}

} **else** {

}

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to create 1-1 video calls in my app using the Agora SDK in SwiftUI. The Agora SDK is built for UIKit, so I'm trying to wrap the ViewController it into SwiftUI using a ViewControllerRepresentable.

I've implemented the ViewController using the [website tutorial](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/start_call_ios?platform=iOS) (see the code copied below under AgoraViewController.swift).

Then I created a wrapper under AgoraViewControllerRepresentable.swift so I can use it in SwiftUI. From what I've read, this wrapper should create a coordinator to act as a delegate for the ViewController so I can send callbacks to the SwiftUI.

However, the ViewController already uses a delegate to handle a method that sets up the remote view (the video of the person you're calling).

The rtcEngine function implemented in the AgoraViewController delegate relies on fields from the ViewController class, so I don't know how I can migrate that over to the ViewControllerDelegate without somehow getting access to the ViewController class there.

3005,102,2021-06-03 02:49:07,0,1,"I need to update every document within one of my Firestore collections. Each document needs additional data from its corresponding user document.

For example, The document that needs to be updated contains ""John"" and ""Amanda"" 's uids. I need to add additional fields to their shared document that is each of their ""FullName"": ""John Adams"" and ""Amanda Smith""

Before Update:

     {
      ""Document""
        ""userA"": ""John"",
        ""userB"": ""Amanda""
    }

After Update:

        ""userAFull"": ""John Adams"",
        ""userB"": ""Amanda"",

**Approach**

Since I have to update every document within the collection (Approx 20k documents) I decided to write a Cloud Function using chained batched writes to solve this problem so that all the requests do not have to go through the Firestore API, like the client reads and writes.

Here is the material I have referenced when creating my function:

Porting an app that's using Core Data to Realm is very simple. If you have an app that already uses Core Data, and have been considering the move to Realm, this [step-by-step guide](https://developer.mongodb.com/how-to/realm-migrate-from-core-data-swiftui/) is for you! The way that your code interacts with Core Data and Realm is very different depending on whether your app is based on SwiftUI or UIKit—this guide assumes SwiftUI (a UIKit version will come soon.)

You're far from the first developer to port your app from Core Data to Realm, and we've been told many times that it can be done in a matter of hours. Both databases handle your data as objects, so migration is usually very straightforward: Simply take your existing Core Data code and refactor it to use the Realm SDK.

After migrating, you should be thrilled with the ease of use, speed, and stability that Realm can bring to your apps. Add in MongoDB Realm Sync and you can share the same data between iOS, Android, desktop, and web apps.",Migrating a SwiftUI iOS App from Core Data to Realm

The only downside that I am facing at the moment is the naming conventions of the services that I have created: I am using gRPC packages, something live app.service.v1, what this implies is that protobuf classes of these services are going to be called by the name of that package, snake cased which is ""odd"". 

Also, is it common to create other classes which are very similar to the one defined in the proto file and use those internally in the application along with some kind of mappings between grpc classes and internal structs?

    }

However, I notice that, if my UICollectionViewCell is created with XIB, it will randomly exhibit flickering behaviour, during drag and drop.

The CustomCollectionViewCell is a pretty straightforward code.

# CustomCollectionViewCell.swift

&amp;#x200B;

    import UIKit
    
    extension UIView {
        static func instanceFromNib() -&gt; Self {
            return getUINib().instantiate(withOwner: self, options: nil)[0] as! Self
        }
        
        static func getUINib() -&gt; UINib {
            return UINib(nibName: String(describing: self), bundle: nil)
        }
    }
    
    
    class CustomCollectionViewCell: UICollectionViewCell {
    
        override func awakeFromNib() {
            super.awakeFromNib()
            // Initialization code
        }
    
    }

&amp;#x200B;

# Flickering

By using the following code

    let customCollectionViewCellNib = CustomCollectionViewCell.getUINib() collectionView?.register(customCollectionViewCellNib, forCellWithReuseIdentifier: ""cell"") 

It will have the following random flickering behaviour - [https://youtu.be/CbcUAHlRJKI](https://youtu.be/CbcUAHlRJKI)

&amp;#x200B;

# No flickering

However, if the following code is used instead

    collectionView?.register(UICollectionViewCell.self, forCellWithReuseIdentifier: ""cell"") 

Things work fine. There are no flickering behaviour - [https://youtu.be/QkV2HlIrXK8](https://youtu.be/QkV2HlIrXK8)

&amp;#x200B;

May I know why it is so? How can I avoid the flickering behaviour, when my custom UICollectionView is created from XIB?

Please note that, the flickering behaviour doesn't happen all the time. It happens randomly. It is easier to reproduce the problem using real iPhone device, than simulator.

Here's the complete sample code - [https://github.com/yccheok/xib-view-cell-cause-flickering](https://github.com/yccheok/xib-view-cell-cause-flickering)

[Books UITableView with Book Source Dynamic Section Headers](https://preview.redd.it/4vie773q6y471.png?width=370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=885ae4ef7b117355104373abb89e442445cef2fd)

# The Table View utilises dynamic (data driven) section headers to group Core Data records by user selected criteria.

# Scenario

Our Core Data database contains a collection of books, with attributes like Title, Author, and Source (Kindle, Kobo, etc.). We wish to present a table view with source (Kindle, Kobo, etc.) as section headers and books of each source shown in their relevant section.

# Audience

The article is for Swift developers who seek complete, integrated, code-centric solutions to speed up their development projects.

# UI

The queries menu shows lists of books by user-selected criteria (author, genre, source, etc.). The query result table view utilizes dynamic section headers (name of the author, type of genre, etc.) to group related records in a mini section within the overall list.

The file **BooksBySourceTableViewController.swift** controls the layout, order, and navigation of the UITableViewController to show books by source. The used model has 2 book sources: Kindle and Kobo, but you can add your own further sources. The class adds the appropriate section header dynamically, after sorting the books by the book source.

The **Queries.storyboard** contains the storyboard for the query.

&amp;#x200B;

[Books by Source Query Storyboard](https://preview.redd.it/114gwxtx6y471.png?width=585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3c9ff30aaabe01078be18f192e591d1e5219b52)

# Logic

* Declare the variable arrays that will contain the queryBooks to allow section headers:

*queryBooks: \[Book\] = \[\]*

*sectionHeaderTitles = \[String\]()*

*sectionBooks = \[Book\]()*

*sectionBooksArrays = \[\[Book\]\]() // each array is one section books*

* Retieve all the books from Core Data and populate queryBooks\[\]
* Filter and sort quearyBooks\[\]
* Loop through the queryBooks\[\] array and compare each book source with the prior book source (include special logic to the 1st time through the loop)
* Add the book to the sectionBooks\[\] array, the source to the sectionHeaderTitles\[\] and the similar source books to the sectionBooksArrays.
* Show the table view, using the special section header functions: heightForHeaderInSection(..) and viewForHeaderInSection(..)

## Navigation

BooksBySourceTableViewController.swift **didSelectRow()** will navigate to the selected row Book Details view **BookDetailsViewController.swift**

We establish the connection between the BySource query and the Book Details by assigning a reference to the Book Details navigation controller, in Custom Class attribute **Identity: Storyboard ID**, and linking to the reference from the query Storyboard Reference ID.

to

&amp;#x200B;

I have started learning swift as my first language, and have never done anything with computer besides gaming up until a few months ago. So it was just a lot of learning a bunch of new things I was not familiar with. I spent the last 3 months just working through courses and books, and not doing a whole lot of building on my own. I recently got to a point to where I feel good enough to start doing my own things to expand off of. 

Very quickly realized I forgot a lot of fundamentals. so I restarted going over the basics a refresher before doing my own builds. I then realized I don't fully grasp functions all that well when building. I think it all makes sense when using example code, but when looking at a blank screen I realize that I don't truly ""get it"".  As far as using them I can only write very basic ones in playground but when it comes to using it in an app I get lost and I just can't make things click for it to make sense for a little more complicated ones.

I have read apples books, Ray wenderlich course, code with Chris, and Hacking with swift.

When every they cover topics about functions it is always simple things like 

func addTwoNumbers(number: Int, anotherNumber: Int) -&gt; Int{

return number + anotherNumber

}

addTwoNumbers(7,3) --- 10

""Awesome now you can write a function!""

Its all very basic, but for some I am just having trouble seeing how to manipulate the parameters based on user input. I know about State and bindings. I just need a simple break down on how to externally change the parameters(preferably a video link/format), because all the programs are just built in playgrounds, and when ever they change a parameter, they just go in and manually change it, which obviously won't work in a real app. I am a visual learner I just need to see it done. I know I could just go in and follow along with tutorial projects to see how its done but, but I don't need a whole project, just the simple concept I need, and I am just trying to get this down because, like I said I want to do a refresher before I build my own things, I feel I have reached a point to where I don't get much out of a whole tutorial anymore. 

Please do not say ""Just read the book"" or ""just code more"" it does not help and I have read the books and I am asking because I am trying to ""just code more"". I just need to see how its done and I am having difficulty finding exactly what I need, be it phrasing or otherwise.",Trouble understanding basics to expand on. can someone point me in the right direction?

[GIF Books UITableView Animated, Floating Sort By Menu](https://i.redd.it/y2e4rormhq571.gif)

# Scenario

Our app will allow users to sort the Books table view by utilising an animated, floating menu. The menu is triggered by tapping a ‘hamburger’ menu button, and offers 4 sort in-place criteria: By Title, Author, Series, and (User) Rating.

# Technique

We design the menu in its own separate view, **AnimatedMenuViewController.swift**, then overlay it with a transparent background on top of the table view. The animation is provided by Meng To’s Spring package from GitHub. As the table sort happens ‘in place’, we refresh the table view in **viewWillAppear()**.

The **BooksTableViewController.swift** acts as a **delegate** to AnimatedMenuViewController, so that any user actions on the menu can be detected by BooksTableViewController and the sort logic is executed.

# Audience

The article is for Swift developers who seek complete, proven, code-centric solutions to speed up their development projects.

[GIF Books App Walkthrough at First Launch](https://i.redd.it/4y74ce3j94671.gif)

# Scenario

Our app will guide first time users through a carousel-like walkthrough, presenting pages (images with text overlays), swipe gestures and Next/Done buttons page controls.

The walkthrough will support the following:

&gt;***Swipe Gestures***\*, to move to the next page  
&gt;  
&gt;\****Next Button***\*, to move to the next page  
&gt;  
&gt;\****Done Button***\*, at the last page to end the walkthrough\*

This article will show a walkthrough of 3 pages (with minimal text), but in your app you can show as many pages as desired, and add relevant text and annotations. You may also explore animations!

# Technique

We shall utilise Swift’s 2 main Walktrhough controllers: WalkthroughPageViewController and WalkthroughContentViewController.

**WalkthroughContentViewController** controls the display and behaviour of the page elements: labels, images and buttons.

**WalkthroughPageViewController** controls the behaviour of the pages group, the actual text of page headings and image file names, the page index, and the forward movement.

# User Interfaces

The **WalkthroughPageViewController** Storyboard contains only 1 Library object: a Page View Controller.

[Xcode Library Page View Controller](https://preview.redd.it/887gkrcq94671.png?width=687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c22d0594410122b589ae0c54849e7c1d8fa6dda0)

**WalkthroughContentViewController** Storyboard contains all the page elements and the Library object Page Control (dots at bottom of page showing index).

We add the Walkthrough page images to Assets.xcassets.

&amp;#x200B;

# Logic

**WalkthroughContentViewController.swift** will declare and control the variables, buttons and pageControl elements, sets the index of the displayed page, and increments the page index when the Next button is tapped.

**WalkthroughPageViewController.swift** will define the pageHeadings and pageImages, control the forward/backward movement of the pages, and display the contents of the page defined in WalkthroughContentViewController.swift.

The first view in the app is the **BooksTableViewController.swif**t. So, in the **viewWillAppear()** we shall check a boolean flag that indicates if the user has not already seen the Walkthrough (false, from the **UserDefaults**). If the flag is false start the walkthrough on first app launch and set the UserDefaults to true, so next launch will ignore the walkthrough.

# Code

The scenario could be enhanced by adding a Prior button (to go back to a previous page) and a Close button (to end the walkthrough before the end), which would make the navigation friendlier.

I am a beginner to Swift and Xcode so please forgive my ignorance.

I presume this is because the code is not compiled within the playground environment.

Hello, there [r/apple](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/)!

I am a 20-year-old developer who is currently studying at university(CS of course) and would like to share my invention that I strongly encourage students and people who want to make the best out of their time to use.

The idea started when my workload began to pile up in and outside of high school, and I could not really procrastinate, because I would not be able to do everything in one day like I used to. Therefore, since I was currently reading some biographies of people such as Benjamin Franklin and Elon Musk, which were very keen on the idea of how planning their time increased their overall productivity, I gave it a shot.

Planning my time on paper was fine, but the action itself took away from what it was supposed to make faster. I had to write down repetitive activities(such as lessons) every day and I would often be late to switching tasks, as I was not reminded when something was starting/ending and I did not keep track of time. Therefore I decided to give some Calendar apps a try. My experience was pretty bad, their design was suboptimal and it took me way too long to plan my day compared to planning it on paper. Additionally, I thought there will be a lot of advantages, such as detailed statistics of how I spend my time or some recommendations to what I should spend my time on(regarding my previous planned days).

Therefore as a consumer, I tried to solve all of the issues and create the ideal time planner for pretty much anyone, so I created [Calendar Buddy](https://apps.apple.com/sk/app/calendar-buddy-day-planner/id1548197606). It has an intuitive and nice design(although now only in dark mode as the dark mode is correlated with productivity - light will be coming soon), a fast way to plan your time(probably as fast as on paper), and also very detailed statistics(compared to other calendar apps). What else would you want?

I think this app can be useful for anyone whether it is that you do not want to forget about your meetings or make the best out of your time, planning with [Calendar Buddy](https://apps.apple.com/sk/app/calendar-buddy-day-planner/id1548197606) is a good way to not be **BUSY** but **PRODUCTIVE -** As often people confuse the two.

I hope it can help you in some way to become a better you,

Have a great day, and do not hesitate to ask anything!

3078,1848,2021-06-25 21:27:17,13,1,"TL;DR: Have you written software that directly calls BNNS inside of Accelerate? Are you working on a project (open or closed source) outside of Apple that does heavy number crunching with Swift? Let's chat! 

I'm a grad student who has taken an interest in Swift, with some background in high performance computing. 

I kind of just stumbled into Swift, and my first impression is that the language looks really cool! But I'm *really* confused about the state of Swift as a platform.

- [Swift for Tensorflow has come and gone.](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/guide/overview) It provided an enormous momentum for Swift into this domain, though. But this worries me that there isn't a community here.

- [Apple released a numerics library under Apache 2!](https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics) This is great news.

- [There is tons of functionality in Accelerate.framework which looks like it'd be great for making math-heavy code.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/bnns#topics) Looks like a super cool foundation for an intermediate/advanced deep learning project.

- [There is also tons of stuff that straight up breaks all the time in Accelerate.framework](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/7500). Am I even linking against the same code as Apple engineers in these lower level libraries?

- [There was a really cool talk this year on Metal Compute for ML.](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10152) This kinda gives me the impression they want people to buy into this ecosystem.

I'll go ahead and state the obvious that Swift was never originally optimized around this sort of work. Apple definitely cares more about optimizing the developer UX of CoreML / Vision than the sort of stuff I'm talking about, because a good iOS development UX is priority #1. That's not bad, and I accept that what I'm asking about is already going off the beaten path on a platform where the main source of documentation is the code samples at developer keynote talks. 

[Jeremy Howard from fast.ai was really excited about this new direction in Swift in 2019](https://www.fast.ai/2019/01/10/swift-numerics/), and I'm curious if he still thinks that ""Swift for high performance compute"" has a future outside of Apple's internal codebase. Hell, even Apple still links against C/C++ kernels because there isn't much of a point in rewriting code that you can link against from Swift (although the boilerplate of calling BLAS routines from Swift is a bit nauseating). 

The reason I'm typing all of this to see if I can get an idea for what's out there already that doesn't require me to be employed at Apple to use either as a dependency or for inspiration. It doesn't seem like there are any accessible tutorials / projects out there for:

- Rolling your own statistical ML (e.g., stochastic variational inference, probabilistic programming) libraries and using them in Swift Projects

- Using BNNS to make and train your own neural network (I guess CoreML really does cover most useful deep learning tasks, but still!). 

- Rolling your own TF-IDF search or other data mining / information retrieval algorithms which would typically rely on Accelerate, but maybe you could use Metal Compute?

I'm really just trying to figure out if it's even worth bothering with this sort of stuff if I don't work at Apple. I don't mind the fact that this stuff gets pretty difficult sometimes. I don't mind that Linux support for Swift leaves a lot to be desired. I'm just trying to see through the mixed messages that Apple keeps sending to people like me. Do they want us working on this stuff or no?",Are people using Swift for machine learning / differentiable programming outside of Apple?
3079,1847,2021-06-25 22:50:11,4,1,"I'm building a macOS swiftUI app with a sidebar navigationView that determines what displays on the right of the screen. The user is able to move around the items in the sidebar. However when an item is dragged to a new location, the selection in the navigationView is removed. I was wondering how I could keep the same item selected after one is moved, even if the one being moved in the one selected.

This is my code for the NavigationView:

    NavigationView {     List() {         ForEach(instances) { instance in NavigationLink(destination: InstanceView(instance: instance), tag: instance, selection: $selectedInstance) {                 InstanceRow(instance: instance).id(UUID())             }         }          .onMove(perform: move)     }     .listStyle(SidebarListStyle())     .navigationTitle(""Instances"")     .frame(minWidth: 150)     .toolbar {         ToolbarItem {             Button(action: toggleSidebar, label: {                 Image(systemName: ""sidebar.left"")             })         }     }     .onAppear {         selectedInstance = instances[0]     } } 

And here's my move() function:

    private func move(from source: IndexSet, to destination: Int) {     var revisedItems: [Instance] = instances.map{$0}      revisedItems.move(fromOffsets: source, toOffset: destination)              for reverseIndex in stride(from: revisedItems.count - 1, through: 0, by: -1) {         revisedItems[reverseIndex].userOrder = Int16(reverseIndex)     }              do {         try viewContext.save()     } catch {         let nsError = error as NSError fatalError(""Unresolved error \(nsError), \(nsError.userInfo)"")     } } 

I'm not sure why this causes the selectedInstance to turn to nil, and I've tried saving the index of the selectedInstance and calculating what it should be after moving the item, but I haven't had any luck with this. So what would be the say to preserve the selected sidebar item?

It mentioned

*If we wanted to write a more correct singleton object, we could make the initializer for* *DataProvider*  
*private. This would mean that we can no longer create new instances of* *DataProvider*  
*:*

    struct DataProvider {
      static let shared = DataProvider()
    
      // useful properties and methods
    
      private init() {
        // now we can only create new instances within DataProvider
      }
    }

*Of course, there's still a possibility that you add an extra static property to* *DataProvider*  
 *and that you create more than one instance that way.*

*Personally, I would consider the above implementation good enough though, and I think you understand the point.*

But, I thought using struct to implement singleton is inaccurate? As it will create another copy of instance during assignment operation.

I write the following code snippet, to show 2 different instances are created, even if we are using private init for struct.

    struct DataProvider {
        static let shared = DataProvider()
    
        var x = 100

        }
    }
    
    do {
        var dataProvider0 = DataProvider.shared
    
        var dataProvider1 = dataProvider0

Now I have a personal hobby project that I'd like to make into an iOS app (or just a prototype such that I can test it on my device)

The prototype is very simple and should only allow me to: 

\- Record a video

\- Trim the video to a specific fragment (this fragment will then be sent off to the server for classification). Also, it could be that there are multiple fragments in the same video that need to be sent off (so users should be able to do that). 

\- Show the label that the video(s) got classified with, on top of the original video. 

\- Save the video with the labels drawn over the respective frames, which were sent off for classification.

I have been reading tutorials and documentation, and it seems like AVKit are providing AVFoundation most of the functionality that I need.

1. Implement the video trimming (also for multiple trims in the same video)
2. Capture the frame numbers of which chunks of video got trimmed and sent to the server

3112,84,2021-07-10 14:37:34,44,1,"Has anyone ever proposed allowing ""auto const"" to be used to declare a variable that has deferred initialization. For example

    else {
        is_answer = false;

Initialization would have to occur in the same if/else block. I know that swift allows you to do this, so it can be done (in theory, not sure if the C++ parser would have some C++ specific issues here). I know this might be an anti-pattern as you should just initialize the variable with a separate function (and there are some weird lambda tricks that you can play to do this as well), but all of those solutions are really verbose. 

I don't think it would break any type rules either. The other really cool thing about this is that you might have code that decides the variable is not actually needed, in which case initialization never takes place, which could also provide a performance optimization in some cases. Obviously you would not be able to use the variable until it has been initialized as well. And in this case, it might make sense to only allow ""auto"" as you could state that the variable has not been assigned a type yet, which could be useful for ensuring that initialization occurs before use. 

Just curious. I cannot be the only person who has thought about this.","Use of ""auto const"" with deferred initialization?"

This is my PersistenceController, from a hacking with swift article:

    struct PersistenceController {
        static let shared = PersistenceController()
    
        let container: NSPersistentContainer
    
        init(inMemory: Bool = false) {
            container = NSPersistentContainer(name: ""Main"")
    
            if inMemory {
                container.persistentStoreDescriptions.first?.url = URL(fileURLWithPath: ""/dev/null"")
            }
    
            container.loadPersistentStores { description, error in
                if let error = error {
                    fatalError(""Error: \(error.localizedDescription)"")
                }

            let context = container.viewContext
    
            if context.hasChanges {
                do {
                    try context.save()
                } catch {
                    let nsError = error as NSError
                    fatalError(""Unresolved error \(nsError), \(nsError.userInfo)"")
                }
            }
        }
    }

I use these functions in both classes for my Core data objects to change stuff in Core data:

    static func add(name: String, puzzle: String, notes: String? = nil, order: Int, context: NSManagedObjectContext) {
        let newInstance = Instance(context: context)
        
        newInstance.name = name
        newInstance.puzzle = puzzle
        newInstance.notes = notes
        newInstance.order = Int16(order)
        
        PersistenceController.shared.save()
    }
    
    static func delete(_ instance: Instance, context: NSManagedObjectContext) {
        context.delete(instance)
        
        PersistenceController.shared.save()
    }
    
    static func edit(_ instance: Instance, name: String? = nil, puzzle: String? = nil, notes: String? = nil, order: Int? = nil, context: NSManagedObjectContext) {
        if name != nil {
            instance.name = name!
        }
        if puzzle != nil {
            instance.puzzle = puzzle!
        }
        if notes != nil {
            instance.notes = notes!
        }
        if order != nil {
            instance.order = Int16(order!)
        }
        
        PersistenceController.shared.save()
    }

(I have 2 entities, with a 1-to-many relationship. Both have these functions, just a bit different in the other)

I just use a simple FetchRequest to access the Core data objects:

    @FetchRequest(
        entity: Instance.entity(),
        sortDescriptors:
            [
                NSSortDescriptor(
                    keyPath: \Instance.order,
                    ascending: true)
            ]
    ) private var instances: FetchedResults&lt;Instance&gt;

An example of where core data slows down my UI is here:

    withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.2)) {
        stopwatch.stop()
    }
    addSolve(time: stopwatch.secondsElapsed)

Stopping the stopwatch normally has a smooth animation, but creating the new object and saving it to Core data causes some lag and sometimes makes the animation not smooth.

So what do I need to change to make core data work in the background and not interfere with my UI? Is there any edit I can make just to the PersistenceController so that I don't have to explicitly tell it to run in the background every time I do anything with core data? Or would I just be able to include any code for running in the background inside my add, edit, and delete functions?

\*\*\*\*\*

Hey everyone, I just released an update to an iOS app I made almost a year ago that lets you listen to Animal Crossing music based on the time of day, just like how the music plays in-game!

\#What’s new

This update aimed to make the app more accessible. I won’t bore you with the details, but before, you would have to manually add songs from the Animal Crossing Soundtracks to your phone, using a computer, in a lengthy process. Now, you can add music to the app directly, and even use a structured file to import a full 24-hour soundtrack in only a few clicks!

The app is called AC Tape Deck, it got good reception around the time it came out, so I hope you’ll give it a try!

\#Importing Songs/Making playlists

If you want to import the New Horizons soundtrack, you can import \[this url\](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MPG13/randomfilesjustignore/main/acnh.json) in the app, and it will download all the music needed, and make the full playlist, with no other work needed on your part. If you want to make a similar auto-add playlist, you can use that JSON file as a template, or if people want, I can make them myself for the other games!

If you don’t have the ability to make and host a json file for the auto-add playlists, you can also just add individual songs into the app, and select them in the file selection menu. Alternatively, if you have a zip file containing songs, you can import that, and it will unzip them and add any mp3s inside it to the app.

The original method of importing music is still available, you can use the Apple Music app if you can Animal Crossing soundtrack synced to your device, you can import it through there. It’s good for saving on storage because it can stream music, but that takes an Apple Music subscription, as well as setup on a computer. The new ways of importing music listed above don’t have those requirements.","Update to AC Tape Deck, a completely free iOS app that plays the Animal Crossing soundtracks based on the current hour, written entirely in swift!"

However, when the text becomes too big, it just goes off the screen instead of shrinking, even though I have minimumScaleFactor and lineLimit set.

Concurrency allows multiple tasks to run at the same time. Understanding concurrency is an important part of iOS app development. When used correctly, it can create a pleasant user experience and can even avoid crashing your app. In this course, you will learn about the new concurrency features available in Swift using Async/Await and Actors. 

Async/Await and Actors are the future direction of concurrency in Swift and this course will teach you the concepts and practical uses of these modern features. After completing this course, you will be comfortable to add these new features in your applications.

This post was inspired by a post I saw in r/androiddev so I'll do it for the iOS. I will keep mentioning MoPub as it's the one I've heard good things about and I have had experience with.

***So what is mediation?***

Mediation allows you to add/incorporate multiple ad networks/ads into your app. 

***What is the benefit of this?***

Well a couple. As opposed to only having one ad network, you may find a higher fill rate with mediation, as you can never get a 100% fill-rate with any network, let alone just one. So by having multiple, you can really increase your fill rate. Meaning more revenue, but the beauty of mediation is that the ad networks you incorporate are pitted against one another and the network/ad which bids the highest, get's the spot. (CHA CHINGGGGGGG!)

Furthermore, in the event of a network server being down, or getting wrongly flagged (looking at you Google), you can still guarantee you will earn some revenue. 

***This sounds awesome, how do I do it?***

Well first of all you must visit my blog, pay to read and give me your left lung. - Sarcasm.

There are a number of networks that allow for mediation, even some ad networks themselves allow for mediation but they will prioritise their own. 

From my personal experience, I have used MoPub, which is developed by Twitter.

Step 1:

Sign up to your chosen mediation network.

Step 2: 

If you're using MoPub go to Marketplace and select ""Publish an app"". From there you find your app, and select the corresponding options/details.

Step 3: 

This is probably the most boring/ball-ache part. Sign up to the networks you want. With MoPub they support a large number of Ad networks from AdMob, FAN (Facebook Audience Network), AdColony, Chartboost et al. Sign up to all the networks you like.

Step 4 -

For each network you want to integrate, create an ad-unit of your choice, banner, rewarded, interstitial et al. Within the network dashboard.

Step 5 - 

Go back to MoPub &gt; Network &gt; New Network and add the corresponding details, I allow for MoPub to gain access to the network.

Step 6 - 

Create your ad unit for your app. Go to Apps &gt; Click on your app &gt; New ad unit. After filling out the information, a QR code will be presented to you along with an ad unit. The ad unit shown is the one you want to use within your app. An the QR code is for testing, you can download the MoPub app from the App Store.

Step 7 -

Configure the ads for each network. Go to Network &gt; Click the corresponding network and hit edit and copy across the ad-unit id from the network you've set up. i.e. Admob would be ca-app-pub, FAN would be 345.... etc. You match up the ad-unit ID to the corresponding network and ad type. 

Step 8 -

Integrate the MoPub SDK via CocoaPods

Step 9 -

Set up MoPub. This example and article has everything you need. You can practically copy and paste everything across.

 [Article showing how to integrate MoPub](https://adampaxton.com/how-to-use-mopub-banner-ads-in-swiftui/)

[GitHub link for MoPub demo](https://github.com/adampax/MoPubSwiftUIDemo)

Step 10 -

Be sure to change the IDs to match your very own. To find your ad-unit ID go to Apps &gt; Select your app &gt; Select the ad-unit &gt; Hit the down arrow near the Edit Ad Unit button &gt; View code integration. And just copy your **Ad unit ID.**

Once you have been accepted by MoPub Marketplace, given you've added an app, completed your tax form, and created an ad-unit, your ads should be live. In the meantime, you can test your integration with test ads. If you're from the UK like I am, I believe you fill out the second W8 form. (You'll see what I mean when you get there).

I am not endorsing MoPub or any networks which I have mentioned by name, I'm only going off what I have experience with. 

Side note - 

You can change and modify the floor rate i.e. the lowest you wish to get paid. By default MoPub set it to $0.05.

I know it seems like a lot, and I felt the same when I first learned about all this, but in reality, it's a piece of cake. If anyone needs any help/assistance, please feel free to contact me.",Increase your ad revenue with mediation

3179,1477,2021-08-16 14:08:03,0,1,"Hi y’all,

i’m learning macos programming for use with a vapor app i wrote. I’m still learning so I don’t really know much about macos programming. That being said, i’m going through hacking with swift’s macos programming book that uses AppKit and Storyboards and it’s teaching me a lot.

I have like two questions about things I haven’t been able to find online:

1) What is the best practice for storyboards when logging into a user account? I have a login page that, upon successful authentication, marks my authentication singleton as authenticated, which loads the next storyboard. The token is refreshed every 30 seconds by a timer in the singleton - the server is local network only so I rely on this to determine server connectivity. When it deauthorizes, the login page is shown again but it’s shown abruptly. Is there a better way than making the whole app rely on a if user.shared.authenticated statement?

2) Because this is a database app, i have a bunch of different things I’d like to have lists of and the ability to open and edit them. I see NSDocument being used as the way to do local file manipulation while having a similar user interface. I haven’t reached this section of hacking with swift’s guide, yet. I think I’m one chapter away. But this is my second question: for a database app, how do I open multiple documents through a storyboard using similar UI functionality? Is NSDocument the right route? I have a lock feature added for when a user does a post request that times out after 5 minutes and will rely on another timer to submit a refresh token for the document, to ensure no one else can edit the document until it’s saved and closed or timed out.

I only started studying swift in the beginning of this year and about two months ago I got hired as a trainee developer to work on a giant UIKit project for a public bank here in Brazil earning R$1500(~USD283.98) a month.

I started learning UIKit one day before getting to work and I really hated it at first. Everything seems to require so much more work and adjusting constraints is not fun at all. Despite all that, I ended up learning to tolerate the framework and the ridiculously giant modular bank app.

Recently I got a job offer to work exclusively with SwiftUI as a Junior developer earning R$2500(~USD473.48) a month on a smaller app targeted towards farmers in the US. 
The thing is that my current scrum master said that he would promote me to junior developer and I would earn R$3000(~USD568.17) as soon as I'd show him my college conclusion certificate, which I'm already getting it.

Currently I have a giant student loan of 5 thousand dollars, I've been saving every penny to pay it and so far I was able to save 2 thousand dollars, so I need more money. But my actual goal is to become a senior developer in order to immigrate anywhere in the first world, where I will be able to enjoy life by not having to save every penny.

**
Considering that I'd probably need a lot of knowledge in both UIKit and SwiftUI to become a Senior, should I stay on this large UIKit project that is kind of a pain in the ass to work with, getting experience with UIKit and a large app project or should I accept the smaller and less paying SwiftUI job that perhaps I would enjoy more?

3212,2979,2021-09-01 13:32:04,11,1,"I'm working on advanced content editor for blog posts as part of my project, where I need attach custom views to the atrributed string of UITextView. I've partly used idea from [RTViewAttachment](https://github.com/rickytan/RTViewAttachment) using swift 5. The problem is I can't get rid of ""icon"" produced (at least I think it's the reason) by placeholder character used in TextStorage as a placeholder where subview will show. Because of fact that I rebuild classes and extension from scratch I think the relevant answer is not hiding in his solution.

**How it works:**

Custom NSTextAttachment (with variable for view) will be inserted to a textStorage as attachment attribute. This custom attachment will replace a character at point of placement for ""object replace character '\\uFFFC' "" and view of attachment will be added as subview of extended UITextView. In TextView is used custom NSLayoutManager with modified drawGlyphs function which will draw glyphs as same as change frame of subviewed view for boundingRect of ""\\uFFFC"" (in order to change position when typing). Bounds of attachment are changed by overriding attachmentBounds in NSTextAttachment.

**Key methods:**

    override func drawGlyphs(forGlyphRange glyphsToShow: NSRange, at origin: CGPoint) {
        super.drawGlyphs(forGlyphRange: glyphsToShow, at: origin)
        self.textStorage?.enumerateAttribute(NSAttributedString.Key.attachment, in: glyphsToShow, options: .longestEffectiveRangeNotRequired, using: { val, range, ptr in
            if let val = val as? GCIViewAttachment, let container = self.textContainer(forGlyphAt: range.location, effectiveRange: nil) {
                var frame = self.boundingRect(forGlyphRange: range, in: container)
                frame.origin.x += origin.x
                frame.origin.y += origin.y + (frame.size.height - val.attachedView.bounds.size.height)
                frame.size = val.attachedView.bounds.size
                val.attachedView.frame = frame
            }
        })
    }
    
    override func attachmentBounds(for textContainer: NSTextContainer?, proposedLineFragment lineFrag: CGRect, glyphPosition position: CGPoint, characterIndex charIndex: Int) -&gt; CGRect {
        var rect = super.attachmentBounds(for: textContainer, proposedLineFragment: lineFrag, glyphPosition: position, characterIndex: charIndex)
        if forceInheritWidth {
            attachedView.frame.size.width =  lineFrag.width - textContainer!.lineFragmentPadding * 2
            rect.size.width = lineFrag.width
        } else if let textContainer = textContainer {
            rect.size.width = (self.attachedView.frame.width &gt; textContainer.size.width) ? textContainer.size.width : self.attachedView.frame.width
        }
        rect.size.height = attachedView.frame.height
        backgroundView.frame = attachedView.frame
        return rect
    }
    
    func insertViewAttachment(attachment: GCIViewAttachment){
        textView.addSubview(attachment.backgroundView)
        textView.addSubview(attachment.attachedView)
        self.textStorage.beginEditing()
        self.textStorage.replaceCharacters(in: self.textView.selectedRange, with: ""\u{fffd}"")
        self.textStorage.addAttributes([.attachment:attachment], range: self.textStorage.editedRange)
        let range = NSRange(location: min(self.textStorage.editedRange.location+self.textStorage.editedRange.length, self.textStorage.length), length: 0)
        self.textStorage.endEditing()
        self.textView.selectedRange = range

```swift
extension Array where Element == Double {
  func sum() -&gt; Double {
    reduce(0.0) { $0 + $1 }
  }
}

I was curious if there was any way in swift to make this extension work on any ""numeric"" type.  I had two ideas on how to make it work but I'm not sure if they're possible in Swift (google searching hasn't yielded much).

In Haskell, there's the `Num`, a typeclass that works for any type that is a number (double, float, int, unsigned int, ect).  Making the extension operate on arrays that contain any numeric type would generalize the extension.

Or in theory, this could work on any type that's ""left reducible"" (has some sort of ""zero"", is traversible, and has + defined).  If there is some sort of ""reducible"" protocol, or even a ""plus"" and ""has zero"" protocols, you could implement the extension for all arrays that contain reducible objects.

Anyone have any thoughts on how I might go about generalizing the extension?  Of if it's even worth trying?",Extension on arrays that hold any swift number type?

In my app I have a view controller called ‘MainView’ and another called ‘TimerView’ the timer view controller is where the user is able to create a timer which pauses audio when it reaches zero. I have a label which displays the current time left which updates every second (called ‘seconds’) on the TimerView however when you go to the MainView and then back to the TimerView, the label has cleared. I need a way to bring back the time left to the label when the TimerView is re-opened. I have tried using notifications but I could not get this working, as the timer also needs to continue counting down.

Note: I have also used ViewDidAppear however there is a delay between open ending the view and the label displaying the time

New to swift but I have a good amount of experience in Java &amp; Python. I'm trying to build a very simple Press a button which in turn adds point to a counter. After doing this pretty easily I've added a second view in which you can purchase multipliers and more. 

On the pressing of the button addpoints() is called while a label displays the number of points with getPoints()

All of my methods are stored as follows 

    struct Game2 {
        public var score: Int = 0
        public var multiplier: Int = 1
        public var PointsPerPress: Int = 1
        
        func getPoints() -&gt; Int{
            return score
        }
        
        mutating func addpoints()  {
            score = score + (PointsPerPress * multiplier)
        }
        
        mutating func PurchaseMultiplier() -&gt; Bool{
            multiplier = 2
            return true
        }
        
        mutating func PurchasePointsPerPress() -&gt; Bool {
            PointsPerPress = 2
            return true
            
        }
        
        mutating func resetscore() {
            self.score = 0
        }
    }

Notes:

*  the Purchase functions return a bool to then trigger a 'Purchase Successful' alert to appear
* In each other Struct (Content view, And The Shop View) I access the struct via 
   * ""@State **private** **var** game: Game2 = Game2()""
      * **I'm guessing this is the problem as I'm creating a new instance within each view, Meaning I don't see the results after returning to the main view from the Shop**
* The 'Mutating' lines are added as a result of a suggested Xcode Fix 
* I'm using navigation view to move into the shop view

This is my first serious project, so predictably, the code was, for lack of a better word, shit at first. After a complete rewrite and numerous edits and updates, I like to think it's at least decent.

The project, written in Python, uses the ML API to search. For the inputs and outputs of information, I used gspread, the API for Google Spreadsheets, aka Google's excel.

How does it work? It's fairly simple. The items spreadsheet allows you to write whatever search you want to keep track of, one per row, with a few possible parameters to narrow down the results. If a publication is found matching the parameters, the data of the publication appears on another spreadsheet, including, its title, the link to the publication, its price, and the date. You can also set up email notifications when something is found. You will likely need some basic knowledge of programming to set it up, but the setup is fairly simple.

The script is meant to be executed periodically. You can do that through a lot of different ways, but I find a free account of [pythonanywhere](https://pythonanywhere.com/), that allows you to have one task that runs daily, to be the simplest way.

The project also includes a couple of supporting files to make the tasks of updating the prices and deleting inactive publications swifter. I particularly use the updating one a lot given the *wonderful* 50% annual inflation of my country.

Level: Junior

Interview prep workflow:

* Review data structure concept in [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html)
* Using VSCode and Python, solve problems in leetcode relating to concept
   * Create file called ""XYZ\_leetcode\_problem\_title.py"" and copy function declaration from leetcode over to VSCode
   * If I get stuck on problem for 20 minutes, I will start looking at solutions
   * Solve problem, copy solution over to Leetcode and submit
   * Start next problem relating to concept
* Rinse and repeat for each concept, usually do this for 2-3 hours a day before interviews are lined up, then bump it up to 3-4 hrs when interviews are lined up
* If I feel fresh on my data structure concepts, I usually just pull up the [blind curated list of 75 questions](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU) and work from those
* Ensure I understand concepts in the swift programming language and iOS development such as:
   * protocols and delegates
   * classes vs structs
   * enums
   * var vs let
   * lazy declarations
   * optionals
   * weak vs unowned

Not only that, how in the entire universe is a good practice coming up with ""magic numbers"" that works *for some reason.* Why in the entire universe does he handwrites the position of the centre of the screen? For the love of God, why does the `UIScreen` class exist then? 

I don't understand the lack of organisation of the code and the bad habit of having all of it in just one class. The use of extensions, protocols, lazy initialisation and structs is inexistent, which is something that underwhelms me because they're a basic pillar of Swift and are used a great deal. He barely used enums twice, iirc, which was something that completely shocked me.

Another point that I cannot believe is that, in 86 days, ALL projects are done with a single `ViewController`. Yeah, some of them use a `DetailViewController` , but he didn't teach how to create multiple `ViewController` and how to connect them. I cannot put into words how usefulness I felt when I wanted to created a project by myself and I didn't even know how to establish their connection in the Storyboard.

The same goes for the games, they can be as good as you want, but how can you create them only in iPad, with a fixed width and height and only in landscape? I mean, I can understand that you can make some of them in landscape because the game requires it, but out of 8 games (more or less), besides the Guess The Flag project, all of them were in landscape and none of them were made for iPhone. He didn't even addressed the reason for this and, to this day, I still don't know what's the deal with the game development on iPhone. The word variety that I employed at the beginning pales a little regarding this point.

For some reason, I think that Paul is perfectly aware of these issues, but I don't know if they're done on purpose for the sake of selling courses or what. And again, I want to reinforce the fact that the Swift content is not bad and gives you a broad scope of what you can do with the language, but I guess I'll be doing the SwiftUI course elsewhere.",An observation of the 100 days of UIKit course of Hacking With Swift
3271,1934,2021-09-24 15:05:37,16,1,"Hey fellow redactors,

I am a hardware engineer with quite much programming experience (especially C :D ). I developed a device which now needs an app for first macOS, lateron maybe iPadOS. The device is communicating via USB and Ethernet UDP broadcasts (which may be used in the iPadOS case). I started now getting into the general swift syntax, which isn't that much of a problem, but generally I am a newbie in GUI programming (except some 15 year old VisualStudio experience). 

I was now searching for the best approach to start.

Generell it seems like SiftUI is best for creating a MultiPlatform APP. But at the moment I am a little bit overwhelmed by all the Info and bits and parts out there. Most Tutorials are for IpadOS and not mainly macOS.

WHAT I WANT TO DO:

1. I want the ability for the user to create (on the fly) sliders and other elements, which he then can move around, lock and then use.

2. I need something like a timeline. (Maybe utilizing scrollview) where the user can add points (in a video editing software you might call it keyframes) which are connected by lines to each other. This ""timeline"" should be zoom and punchable, and as soon the user scrolls all the way to the right, it should extend automatically.

There is no need to support older iPadOS or macOS Versions other than BigSur but it would be a plus.

Is there a good tutorial for creating a multiplatform app? should I maybe start with a single platform app first? Should I go back to Storyboards instead of SwiftUI?

Tanks for your help and experience!","macOS / iPadOS multiplatform app, where to start."

My question is, should I take more time stopping to create my own code/projects? Its difficult to stay on track for the 100 days if im doing each days task plus extra stuff on top of that. Im already putting 2-4 hours in a day (work full time). Is that on par, or am I just bad at this stuff?

I'm all-in on using SwiftUI to build iOS apps. I find it so much simpler than wrangling with storyboards and UIKit. Unfortunately, there are still occasions when SwiftUI doesn't let you do what you need—forcing you to break out into UIKit.

That's why I always focus on Apple's SwiftUI enhancements at each year's WWDC. And, each year I'm rewarded with a few more enhancements that make SwiftUI more powerful and easy to work with. For example, iOS14 made it much easier to work with Apple Maps.

WWDC 2021 was no exception, introducing a raft of SwiftUI enhancements that were coming in iOS 15/ SwiftUI 3 / Xcode 13. As iOS 15 has now been released, it felt like a good time to cover the features that I've found the most useful.

The same way that the photos app and iMovie slider looks like for video playback. I am trying to get the slider to move 25 points over for every second of the player. I have this code that works, but it is slightly off because of Apple's animation:

    let offset = CGPoint(x: CGFloat(currentTime.seconds * 25) -(UIScreen.main.bounds.width / 2), y: 0)             
    uiView.setContentOffset(offset, animated: true) 

If I set animation to false, it is perfectly in sync, however the animation adds a bit of a delay. How can I fix this? No animation doesn't look smooth.

I also tried:

               uiView.scrollRectToVisible(CGRect(x: CGFloat(currentTime * 25), y: 0, width: 0.01, height: 50), animated: true)

2. Open the side panel using Command + 1

This is the first fail, it does nothing. I found half a dozen pages on Google all saying the above. I finally figured out the keys must have changed. In the menu it's now Command +Alt + S. Fine.

Schedule.program = prog\[0\]   throws   ""Value of type 'Schedule' has no member 'program'""

So I changed it back. No good. Still throwing the error. Two hours later I'm still banging my head into the brick wall, can't get the relationship to work no matter what I do, unless I change codegen to manual/none.

Canvas previews are an in-your-face feature of SwiftUI. When you create a new view, half of the boilerplate code is for the preview. A third of your Xcode real estate is taken up by the preview.

With Xcode 13, previews are finally featured and reliable enough to make them a must-use feature. They speed up development while avoiding embarrassing UI glitches making it into production.

3373,2893,2021-11-05 12:55:17,5,1,"Hi guys,

I started developing macOS and Swift about a Month ago. I tried to develop a small ""timeline view"" which allows to add objects to the timeline, shows position in time of the cursor, allows to zoom in time and so on. (Similar to any video editing software). I got it working quite well for what I think, but I am used to Programming C, so I get it working, but might miss some better performing tricks or easier implementations. you can add this element in an empty window that way:

`self.view.addSubview(scrollView.initialize())`

May anybody tell me how to improve this code? What did I do wrong? What is quirky?

One Problem I got, I have a column on the left, which is fixed and following the scroll movement. Sometimes it is stuck for some milliseconds before its position gets updated. How can I solve this?

Also: I found a `NSEvent.EventTypeMask` for magnify. Is there something like this for scrolling (so both touchpad and mouswheel scroll)? `.ScrollWheel` Seems not to work for touchpad.

Thanks :) Any help is appreciated

I could make the android version of this app in a day or so but I have no experience with ios or swift so I figured I would try a cross platform project so it is easier to maintain and get approval for.

3418,990,2021-11-26 12:49:54,3,1,"XML Localization Interchange File Format (XLIFF) is a native format supported by Xcode and most computer-aided translation (CAT) tools. It helps manage projects systematically and efficiently for fast and high-quality translation.

Using this file format can help you manage localization projects efficiently by standardizing content processing and interactions with translation management systems. It also allows you to leverage translation memory and glossaries to improve your translations.

XLIFF offers many benefits over alternative file formats such as Excel, CSV, or .strings files. It’s an open specification based on ISO-3098 released by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). It’s free to use and widely supported.

As a native file format, XLIFF is particularly suitable for supporting the localization of Xcode apps. Here are the basic steps:

* Prepare all the strings that require translation.
* Create a translation unit for each file in your Xcode project.
* For each translation unit, create filename and source text keys for the files you want to translate. Include additional information about the original text if needed.
* Add context information specific to a target language to help translators create high-quality and accurate translations.
* Export the text in XLIFF into your localization platform or send it to your translation services provider.
* Import the translated XLIFF file back into Xcode to generate localized content in the target language.

Incorrect XLIFF translation methodologies can create technical issues when you import content into the original document or application. Don’t forget that XLIFF isn’t a magic bullet against poorly translated content! You still need to follow localization best practices to ensure high-quality translation.

Read more about the key considerations when implementing XLIFF in your localization project in our [dedicated article](https://www.oneskyapp.com/blog/xliff-xcode/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=swift).

var postiveCount = 0.0   
 var  zeroCount = 0.0   
 var negativeCount = 0.0

guard  if postiveCount % 2 == 0 {  
print(postiveCount)

3442,2021,2021-12-08 20:58:44,10,6,"Hi everyone, been a while. You might remember me from posts about [PiBar](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/gonndo/my_newest_foss_swift_project_pibar_v10_for_macos/), [Life Saver](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/btnrao/i_built_a_foss_screensaver_using_spritekit_an/), [Last Statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/g8nf0w/im_back_with_another_foss_macos_screensaver/), and others. Last week I started streaming on Twitch, and on Monday I decided for fun I would create a small menu bar app for [Swatch Internet Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time). It started as a joke with a friend, but I figured why not do it for real. I did a little research and saw some existing apps, including two on the App Store, and felt like I could make something better. So... I did!

So in three hours on Monday I [built a lot of the app on stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1226359682), and then wrapped it up yesterday off stream, set up the public repo, and submitted it to the App Store. And today it got approved!

What is this app? Well, back in 1998 Swatch (the watch company) tried to create ""internet time"", a method of telling time without timezones that could be used online. Every day is broken up into 1000 "".beats"", from \\@0 to \\@999, starting at Midnight ""BMT"" (GMT+1). For example, \\@42 is is 4 PM in California, but it's 5:45 AM in Nepal. But if we both arrive to the meeting \\@42, we don't have to worry about that.

This app shows the current internet time in your menu bar, and has a window for 'simulating' internet time, so you can see what your local time is for every .beat of internet time. It also includes a massive grid of most major timezones on the planet so you can see what the time is for other places at the same time.

[dotBeat screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/044qeqvrsd481.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=501c80c0e9deebdcf2a283855f37d0df11ed175d)

The code might be a bit of a mess, I haven't done a good solid refactor pass on it since it's so simple anyway. Here's the repo: [https://github.com/amiantos/dotbeat](https://github.com/amiantos/dotbeat) 

This was the first project where I built part of the user interface dynamically in code, which made it really easy for me to generate the grid of timezones. It was also the first time I dealt too much with \`Date\` and \`TimeZone\`, both of which are really cool. It's great that so much localization is handled for me, and the app responds properly if you've set your system to 24-hour time and so on.

As with PiBar, the app is free and open source, you can download it here: [https://amiantos.s3.amazonaws.com/dotBeat-v1.0.zip](https://amiantos.s3.amazonaws.com/dotBeat-v1.0.zip)

Similarly to PiBar, if you really want to, you can buy it on the App Store for $1.99 [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dotbeat-internet-time/id1599168929](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dotbeat-internet-time/id1599168929)

Exactly 3.5 years ago I had absolutely Zero programming skill and never even considered programming as something to consider. During that time, I was deeply interested in the stock market and spent waaay too much time on Excel over-analyzing company earnings. My journey in the programming world actually started off with R-Programming after watching a speed comparison video between R vs Excel, and decided to give programming a shot. Nine months later after finally starting to get the hang of R programming, WWDC2019 came along and Apple released SwiftUI. To say the least: I. Was. Mind. Blown.

I decided to give it a shot. SwiftUI was extremely beginner friendly and pleasingly enjoyable experience, but Swift itself was personally brutal for me. This was because of the unique state I was in, of attempting to learn Swift by jumping into it exclusively through the lens of SwiftUI (Declarative Paradigm) while UIKit/AppKit (Imperative programming) was still the main lens of Swift, while also coming from a completely different language, R Programming, all while still being new to the coding world. After about a year of on-and-off learning, in the summer of 2020 I decided it was time to start working on a macOS app. But the app eventually got too complicated and difficult for me to debug, I decided to take a section out and turn it into it's own app, thus, [QFindify](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/qfindify/id1598790473) was born. A few months later, here we are, an app in the appStore, with another on the way, and I'm more confident in my choice to pursue this path than ever before.

I know the above was overly long, but I love reading other's posts on their swift journey in this sub as it gives me motivation to keep going, and I hope this give others who are having tough times to keep going as well. 

My confort zone is SwiftUI so the app is nearly all SwiftUI, with only the AppDelegate still needing Appkit/Cocoa for access to statusbar and NSPopover. The app lets you search your images for words with an IAP that allows you to copy the texts, advanced filtering, and saving to folder/PDF.  Shoot me any questions you may have and if you decide to give the app a shot, let me know if you encounter any issues or feedbacks you want to send my way.",QFindify: A macOS Menubar App made with SwiftUI

3464,2053,2021-12-25 13:49:13,0,1,"Before I ask my questions here is a little bit of my background. I mostly do mobile app development. Currently working with React native and flutter. Previously worked with Native Android with kotlin.

I am trying to learn web development but still considering myself a noob.

Consider a scenario. You have four methods. Method A, Method B, Method C and Method B. Method B has a network call to an api. You are calling Method B from Method A and waiting for result from Method A. Method D has some kind of huge mathematical calculation and you're calling Method D from Method C. Consider Method and function as same in this scenario and I will be using them interchangeable.

In Javascript land (Web development)

1. If I am calling Method A. I will use async await to get result from Method B and as Method B is doing an api call. Suppose I am using fetch or axios to do the api call. As Javascript being single threaded language does fetch or axios do network call on the main thread itself. I think it does and if it does why does he don't cause janky UI in web development while we are waiting for the result. Why does the app still runs 60fps if network call is done on main thread. Or may be it does cause to yank a little but the network call happens so fast it is not noticeable to human eyes given how mobile data and wifi has improved a lot in recent years. Forget about web workers. I have not seen people using web workers for network call. You may use it but don't consider for this scenario.
2. If I am calling Method D which in calls Method C. I will again use async await to get result from Method C. Again the mathematical calculation is done on main thread and in this case it does causes janky UI if the mathematical calculation is huge. I know web workers would be useful to do such kind of large calculations but why it does not cause same kind of Junk in first case.

In React Native land

3. In Android there is a rule that if you do network call on main thread, the OS will crash your app. But if I am calling Method B which does api call using fetch or axios isn't that done on main thread itself. Why does it does Android OS does not cause the app to crash or Application not responding error.

4. Also there is no UI jank when I call method B if network call is done on main thread which is I still don't understand?

In Flutter land

5. Same as that of React Native, Dart is single threaded. I know there is something called isolates which allows to do operations on different thread I guess. But most flutters developers do http call on main thread itself. Why does Android OS not throw an error if network call is done on main thread in flutter.

6. Again no UI janky when I call method B if network call is done on main thread.

In Native Android with kotlin land

7. If you're calling Method B you will be using Retrofit or Volley which internally does api call on different thread and send the result on main thread so there is no jank which I understand. But suppose if I call method C. I can use Default Dispatcher of Coroutine and then get the result on Main thread. So in this case the async await is truly Multithreaded but I don't understand how async await in web development , React native or Flutter is multithreaded. And if async await is not multithreaded in web development , React native or Flutter why doesn't it cause janky UI if network call but causes janky UI huge mathematical calculation.

In Native iOS with swift

8. I am not a iOS developer so I could be little wrong on my understanding so do correct me in this case. Recently Apple introduced async await in swift. All developers kept saying how this will make multi threading easy which I don't understand. It will definitely make our code clean but suppose you'r calling Method B you will use NSURlSession or Alamofire which does network call in background thread as far as I know as we as developers don't have to worry much about it. But suppose you're calling method D which does mathematical calculation and you want to use async await, you will still have to use Grand Central Dispatch so that your main thread does not rank the UI and cause the frame to drop in case of large mathematical calculation. So how does async await solves multithreading in this case. I think it only makes our code clean and nothing else and we still have to do large running operations on separate thread.

Game Development land

If anyone else has used the Godot game engine or Unity and how it works on different platforms like Web , Mobile and PS, I would be interested to know.

I know there are different concepts like concurrency and parallelism and languages like golang with goroutines make uses of multi core CPUS to make multithreading fast. My knowledge on this is extremely weak and I have watched few of Rob Pike's video on this and couldn't understand anything .If concurrency and parallelism is somehow related to the above questions I asked do highlight them as well.",Why do people confuses async await with multithreading and how does it work in different language?

I wget downloaded a tar file for Swift from the homepage and unpacked it with tar.

Then I read I’m supposed to export the path to that directory.

export PATH=/path/to/Swift/usr/bin:""${PATH}""

To be clear, the path should actually say “/path/to/Swift/use/bin”? Is that abuse of path conventions, like Swift looks for a path with that name or something?

I’m confused because I unpacked the tar file but there was no instruction to run any build scripts or anything.

The resulting file shouldn’t yet be executable. It’s just a file, no?

So regardless of exporting the path, even if I just navigate to that directory, how could Ubuntu possibly recognise if I type in “swift” as a command?

Currently, I'm learning swift via the Udemy course I bought. It's a bit outdated, released in 2019.  
Now, I started a module dedicated to everything AR-related, like ARKit.   
So in the 2019 course, the teacher states that AR is the future. It's cheaper than lots of gear related to VR and it's really fantastic.   


But now is 2022 already and I don't really see too many technologies, apps, or games that focus on ARKit. Seems like people found out it's uncomfortable or so.

That's why I'm wondering whether the teacher was right about it or the AR-related things in iOS development really suck?",Is ARKit worth it?
3497,454,2022-01-10 16:08:34,0,1,"I created a tool called SwiftDependencyChecker that analyses third party dependencies declared in Carthage, CocoaPods and Swift Package Manager to determine if the project is using any  libraries with publicly known vulnerabilities.

The tool is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/kristiinara/SwiftDependencyChecker) and is open source. It can also be installed with Homebrew by running:

`brew tap kristiinara/SwiftDependencyChecker`  
`brew install SwiftDependencyChecker`

I wrote a [blog post](https://medium.com/@kristiina_28701/swiftdependencychecker-check-cocoapods-carthage-and-swift-pm-dependencies-for-known-def2fba890c) describing how the tool is built.

In short the following analysis steps are taken:

1. Analysing Podfile.lock, Cartfile.resolved and Package.resolved to find used library names and versions
2. Finding cpe-s (Common Platform Enumerators) for libraries used
3. Using cpe-s to query the NVD (National Vulnerability Database) and retrieve known public vulnerabilities
4. Matching vulnerable versions with versions used in the project.
5. Analysing Swift files, Podfile.lock, Cartfile.resolved and Package.resolved files to find references to the vulnerable dependencies used and output them.

If the tool is included in the Xcode build phases as a build script then the warnings are displayed within Xcode.

`SwiftDependencyChecker analyse --action sourceanalysis`

Running the tool for the first time takes a long time (especially if there are a lot of libraries in the project), but subsequent runs are significantly faster and do not impact the build time noticeably.

I would appreciate it if anyone would like to try it out and give me feedback. I would be especially happy if anyone tried it out and would find find vulnerable dependencies. Let me know what you think! Would the tool be helpful to you?

NB: SwiftDependencyChecker is open source and does not gather any user data. I worked on it as part of my PhD research on code quality in iOS applications, I hope it would be useful to someone!","I built a tool that detects vulnerable third party libraries used in Swift projects, would appreciate any feedback"

One of the puzzles spawns up to 7 gems, and you have to generate blocks to avoid the portals.

 I was about to start coding a more traditional solution, and then had the dumbest idea. I got the ability to spawn character at will, so why not just spawn characters in all the gem areas and have them each check the spot until all the gems spawn.

It worked! Not my most elegant solution, but a fun one for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

*Ps: It got me thinking though about automating that procedure. I figured out how to automate blocks spawning (by using a for loop and a column/row variable that changed with every loop), but that was becauase I didn't actually have to create an instance of each block. I wonder if there is a way to auto-generate instances by auto-generating names.

I am doing a learner project (FYI [Bookworm](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/bookworm-introduction)).  When I try to make an EditBookView to the project as a personal challenge, I run into some type related problem.  The rating attribute/property is acting up.

`import CoreData`

`import SwiftUI`

`struct EditBookView: View {`

`let book: Book`

`'@Environment(\.managedObjectContext) var moc`

`'@Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss`

`'@State private var rating: Int`

`//the rest of the other attributes`

`init(book: Book) {`

`_rating = State(initialValue: Int(book.rating) ?? """") //error: Cannot convert value of type 'String' to expected argument type 'Int'`

`//the rest of the other attributes`

`}`

I Int it, got that “Can’t convert” error; If I don’t Int it, another error: Binary operator '??' cannot be applied to operands of type 'Int16' and 'String' . I don’t understand why the system says it’s a string. It specifically make it an Int in the '@State private var .

Many many thanks.

I have a view that I want the user to be able to adjust the width of via a 'grab bar' on the right of the view. How can I go about doing this? In the example, \`content\` is my view that i'm trying to adjust. I have tried the following:

&amp;#x200B;

`@State var newWidth: CGFloat?`

&amp;#x200B;

`Rectangle()`

`.fill(Color.gray)`

`.frame(width: 8, height: 100)`

`.cornerRadius(10)`

`.gesture(`

`DragGesture()`

`.onChanged { value in`

`newWidth = max(80, newWidth ?? 0 + value.translation.width)`

`}`

`)`    

&amp;#x200B;

And then for the actual \`content\`, I have added the following:

&amp;#x200B;

`content()`

`.frame(width: newWidth != 0 ? newWidth : width)`

`.frame(minWidth: 80)`

&amp;#x200B;

This just makes my content \`80\` irrespective of what width that I drag the rectangle. What am I doing wrong here? Additionally, there isn't a \*gradual animation/transition\* of the frame being increased/decreased and it just seems to jump to \`80\`. How can I achieve this?

I recently saw that in in Xcode there is also options for UIKIT and Objective C. I also heard about hacking with swift Paul Hudson.

What is the difference between Xcode, playgrounds, SwiftUI, UIKit, Swift language, objective C language.? 

Should I start over with Paul Hudson's classes, if so SwiftUI or UIKit? Or should I continue with the apple's proprietary educational ebook series? Or should I use them in tandem? Something else completely?

3517,178,2022-01-17 10:21:11,0,1,"Hi everyone,

Full disclosure: total iOS development amateur here. My background is embedded firmware development.

TLDR: I'm trying to include a shared library, written in C, into a swift project, but getting ""undefined symbols"" errors

For a project, I'm trying to include a shared library written in C, that I manually cross compiled for ios-arm64 architecture (using ""xcrun -sdk iphoneos clang -arch arm64"" on a macbook ), and I'm trying to include this into a swift based iOS application: as the most simple example let's take the default swift application you get when starting a new iOS application in xcode.

If I understand correctly, the way I should approach this, is adding a target framework to the project (Editor &gt; Add Target &gt; Framework ) and then dragging my shared library (let's name it libcustom.dylib) and my header (custom.h) into the target framework. And then adding this custom header into the framework header file. I also set the framework settings to embed &amp; sign the shared library.

Next, I try to call a function in this shared library in the ViewController.swift file. So what I do is import the framework header and then call the function, let's call it ""perform\_custom\_action()"", but when trying to build I get the following error:

    Undefined symbol: _perform_custom_action

So there is a linking issue, probably it's not linking the library, but I dont know how I can link it in this xcode environment. I see in the compile output that it includes the framework, but I dont know if this framework is correctly including the library...

Does anyone know how I can fix this?  


PS: some sanity checks:

* libcustom.dylib is cross-compiled for arm64, output of ""file libcustom.dylib"" is:

&amp;#8203;

    libcustom.dylib: Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library arm64

* \_perform\_custom\_action is part of the symbols inside libcustom.dylib, when executing ""nm libcustom.dylib"" I get

I started learning a couple months ago, and have enjoyed it so far. I’ve been able to get simple (really simple) stuff running, but I feel like my whole “learning” process is probably holding me back.

What I’ve essentially done since the beginning is basically to try and get a basic understanding of something, implement it, then rinse and repeat. And so far it’s been working out as far as I can tell. 

I went with this route because a friend of mine is a developer and they mentioned that they learnt programming this way, wherein essentially you only learn what you need at the moment.

But a week ago I started to try and implement CoreData into an app and I’m so confused as to how it actually works. I got it working in the end, but I realized later on that I didn’t actually *understand* how it works. Maybe it’s because I associate a database with your typical excel sheet, and from what I understand CoreData isn’t like that.

Naturally, I go online and try to find resources but it’s all tutorials. And so my question is, does Apple’s official docs actually explain stuff like CoreData? Because I’m beginning to feel like my reliance on short snippets of tutorials or explanations aren’t cutting anymore.",Is it worth it to read through all of the official documentation?
