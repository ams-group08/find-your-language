I'm trying to understand what the *-source* parameter of the [java compiler](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html) does exactly. At least I thought I knew what it does until the following happened. 

In our code base we compile with *-source* and *-target* set to *1.6* using a Java 8 JDK. Someone from our team introduced a piece of code that uses Java 7 NIO features, e.g., *java.nio.Paths*. This compiles without issues. I, personally, have ~~not~~ confirmed (EDIT: throws *java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java.nio*) whether the code works or not, but my assumption is that the *-source* parameter only warns about language/syntax incompatibilities, but not about API incompatibilities. I would expect to see *ClassNotFound* or similar runtime exceptions when the code is deployed within a Java 6 VM.

Can someone shed some light on this?

18,2017-01-05 18:12:28,6,13,"Hey @all,

We have a web app which gets very fitted JSON responses. This way the app does not have to calculate or order something. Instead the JSON can be put directly into our chart engine. 

Thing is, this JSON has no similarities with our database entities. 
Our current solution is: 
 1. Frontend Team designs a JSON
 2. We build a object out of that JSON (paste special)
 3. Get all needed entities from Database
 4. fill the frontend object 
 5. make a controller method to deploy this object

I believe there has to be a better solution. 
Step 1 is required, because sorting a 250kb - 500kb JSON file is a pretty big overhead for a web app.
But building(2.) and filling a object(4.) just to make a JSON string(5.) out of it sound a bit unnecessary. 

Instead I would like to have something like a custom JSON converter which, depends on the controller method, gets our loaded entities from database and returns the JSON string. 

Our preferred way would be like:
1. Frontend team designs a JSON
2. We build a serializer
3. Get data from  database
4. return the database data via custom serializer

I've searched for DataContract, custom JSON converter for newtonsoft/web api as well as the java equivalent TypeAdapter for C#.

In Java I could get a big list of Cars from a database. 
With the same list I am able to generate different controller endpoints. Each method gets the same list but I could have an endpoint for a chart engine, table view or picture view. Without mapping into some special object before returning the values. 

I really appreciate your help!! Thank you very much and I hope I can explain myself good enough for others to understand.

50,2017-01-15 15:09:33,23,5,"From http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/jep-286/lvti-faq.html:
Brian Goetz responded on survey answers against LVTI and argues that this is more readable because variable names are supposedly more important:

    var userDB = broker.findUserDB();
    var users = db.getUsers();
    var addressesByUser = db.getAddresses();

than this:

    UserModelHandle userDB = broker.findUserDB();
    List&lt;User&gt; users = db.getUsers();
    Map&lt;User, Address&gt; addressesByUser = db.getAddresses();

But we undoubtly loose a lot of information that we previously could see at first glance and even in the first example the variable names lie or its unclear about what they really are (**userDB**, user**s**, address**es**). To not loose information the programmer should have written something like:

    var foundUserModelHandle = broker.findUserDB();
    var listOfUsers = db.getUsers();
    var userToAddressMap = db.getAddresses();

But it's silly, certainly noisy and we e.g. still do not see what type _adress_ is. The pro argument voiced about variable alignment is an issue of types preceeding the variable instead of suceeding like in Scala. But that ship has sailed 20 years ago. I think that loosing visiblity about type information is more severe than gaining alignment of mostlikely unclear variable names. Additionally even the C# documentation does not recommend using LVTI with method calls. I'm not saying the entire LVTI should be trashed just because of this. Just the readibility argument does not apply in this context and should only be used when the returned type is nested and long. In all other cases (with method calls) its use should be discouraged.

What I have there works and compiles, but I'd like it if the compiler could enforce the type of the value parameter so you cannot pass 'incorrect' types to the call, so that:

    spec.withCriteria(Employee::name, ""Andy"") // Should compile
    spec.withCriteria(Employee::job, JobRole.CEO) // Should compile

    spec.withCriteria(Employee::name, 123) // Shouldn't compile
    spec.withCriteria(Employee::job, ""CEO"") // Shouldn't compile

Interested in trying kotlin for a small web service I was building, I started working on a web framework:

## kog: https://github.com/danneu/kog

Inspired by clojure, I wrapped jetty with a simple `Request -&gt; Response` abstraction and have been stubbing out machinery on top of it ever since, informed by the web service I've been building alongside it.

Two months later it has a decent feature surface area from json encode/decode combinators to a type-safe router to accept-header negotiation, though riddled with `// TODO:`'s and stopping points that came too soon.

132,2017-02-12 14:08:30,13,15,"The Iterator interface in java.util package makes it easy to use the for each loop for a custom implementation of java.util.Collection. It has the basic methods for iteration: hasNext() and next() in addition to remove(). By default the remove() method throws an UnsupportedOperationException.

All the classes of the Collection Framework (I think) implement their iterators in such a way that allows for removal of elements at any arbitrary moment of iteration (given suitable conditions). I have seen the source code of classes like ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap and so on. I have seen that the iterators maintain modCount and expectedModCount variables, for recording and verifying the integrity of the data. They are basically aware of Concurrent Modifications and throw a ConcurrentModificationException when mismatch occurs.

But the point is... Why this redundancy? We already have separate remove() and related methods defined (abstractly) in the Collection interface. Also, I believe people rarely use iterators to remove elements nowadays. We use the designated remove(), retain() and other methods. I believe the code becomes redundant and complicated when this functionality is implemented in Iterators. I say this because I'm writing a few of my own, toy implementations (for educational purposes). I believe that Iterators should not be allowed to change the Collection and hence I have my iterators throw an UnsupportedOperationException when remove() is called. It's basically a trade-off... Simplicity and speed against redundancy. So to summarise...

TL;DR: I believe custom iterators should not allow removal of elements. This leads to cleaner code and removes redundancy.

I am absolutely new to Reddit. So please guide me and point out any areas of concern. :-) Feel free to express your opinions for and against my viewpoint. I am looking forward to a civil discussion. I am looking for opinions and reasons to substantiate them.

I have run across a problem while using jQuery. I am trying to have 3 clickable thumbnails, that when clicked, will move right (and then enlarge, although I have yet to include that statement). I'm not quite sure what is wrong.

I have made sure all of the images are `position:absolute`. My intuition is that perhaps I cannot shift an image to the right using the class selector in the way that I have, but I am not sure what the ""correct"" way is. I understand I could create an `id` for each image but I feel that would be unnecessarily longer, right?

153,2017-02-19 02:29:16,28,15,"I'm developing as part of my PhD a big system in Java that works with data that is contained huge text files.

As a first solution to the problem, I implemented a simple singleton class that loads all the data from the text file (we are talking about a pair of GB) and places it inside a series of `HashMap`s. I decided to go with this solution because I have at hand a huge amount of RAM (~ 64GB) and I need to have a very fast access to this data, since my algorithm uses it a lot.

At this moment, I rely on the following structures:

- 2 x `HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;`
- 2 x `HashMap&lt;String, Set&lt;String&gt;&gt;`
- `HashMap&lt;String, ArrayList&lt;MyObject&gt;&gt;`

`MyObject` is just a wrapper for an `Integer` and a `String`.

Now, in a previous version of the system I only had to read the data from the textual file, the computation took a couple of minutes, and it was ok for me. Since I added some new features (basically access to other -very slow- libraries in order to gather extra data that is not contained inside the original textual file) the loading time peaked to 40 minutes. 

This load time was unacceptable to me, and so I started to explore different solutions in order to get back to a ""fast"" start. 

My first option was, of course, serialization. I discovered that this solution was suitable for all the `HashMap`s but the one that contained the `ArrayList`: all the structures were fast deserialized (~1 minute each), while the one with the `ArrayList` still took ~ 7 minutes. 
Luckly, that particular map didn't require the data from the slow library, so at this moment I'm running on a kind-of dirty solution that I don't really like: most of the `HashMap` are loaded from serialization, and the other is still loaded from the textual file.

Another solution that I would like to try out is using NoSQL database, such as MongoDB, in order to store and recover my HashMaps (hopefully all of them). My only doubt is on the fastness of the JSON deserialization.

Which solution do you think would be best for my problem?

Thank you very much for you attention.

I work at a research lab. We have some custom software that we use for processing and analyzing data, written in C by a graduate student who is no longer working in the lab.

I have an idea for a modification to it that would be relatively simple to implement, and shouldn't be invasive or effect any other part of the code. (There's currently a button that allows you to 'dump data' to an excel spreadsheet, but it doesn't export any useful data. But I think it would be easy to modify that already existing button that already uses an established method for exporting anything to excel in order to export useful data that is most likely specified under established variables in the underlying code).

What is the best way to go about doing this? These might be stupid questions, but I'm wondering about:

- Is there some kind of IDE that common for writing software with C that I could use to practice modifying something, and then seeing how it effects the program?

- Am I likely to experience any kind of roadblocks or obstacles in trying to edit the source code of a program like this? Anything that I should look out for, that I wouldn't be able to anticipate with a background in python/java/C?

- What is the best way for me to make a copy of the code, try to modify it, and then only integrate it with the original program once I am absolutely certain that I haven't fucked anything up (our lab is extremely dependent on this program, so it would be really bad if I messed up the original copy).  I don't know how to use git, but this seems like the type of thing one uses that for.

- Currently the code only runs on a windows OS. Again, this may be stupid, but does that mean that it is unlikely to work on my mac?

- Is there a good method for documenting someone else's code?  The PI at the lab complains that its not well documented, which is pretty sketchy considering our lab is heavily reliant on it and the grad student who wrote it isn't there anymore.

Sorry if these questions are sort of stupid. I guess I just want to have a decent understanding of this before I propose this to the PI of the lab; he might be nervous about letting me do this, and I want to make sure that I sort of know what I'm doing (at least enough to not mess anything up in the original program). 



**EDIT:** It turns out that its written in C#, which is apparently fundamentally different from C. It also looks like its set up to interface with matlab in such a way that I probably won't have to actually edit any source code at all.  Thank you everyone for your help still!

My little knowledge with JWT says that I should generate a new token. 

But the problem with this approach is that the client has to keep track that the server is changing the token and thus always submit the new token. 

This makes writing client hard.

2.  How do I invalidate a token? suppose a user signed in and they got a token for 4 hours. but they signed out after 1 hour. I want to invalidate the token.

174,2017-02-26 12:50:10,0,2,"Recently I noticed that on all programming related subreddits I am subscribed to the topic of error handling is coming up more frequently and I want to add my 2 cents.

I posit that there are three different ways to handle error situations that I call Either, Exceptions and Errors.

Either is a situation where the return type of a function falls into two categories.  Results with which the computation can continue and others with which it cannot.  In typed languages this is represented as an Either type where one side of the either is a union or sum over all the types of results with which we can continue and the other side would be a union or sum over all possible reasons why we can't.

The thing about the Either is that it has to be handled immediately when it occurs.  There is usually nothing that you can do with both sides of the Either.  And so right after the function call that returns an Either type there must be a branch.

Exceptions would be what in Java are called checked Exceptions.  Python, of course, doesn't have these but below, I am trying to make a point why they might be a good thing and how they could be done in python.

Exceptions don't have to be handled right away and can be passed up in the call stack, however, they must be handled somewhere on the call stack and if they are not handled on one level they must be declared in the call signature as possibly being passed on.

The third kind is Errors, or unchecked Exceptions in java, which don't have to be declared if unhandled and in fact don't have to be handled at all in which case the program just stops.

So, when would one use these three different ways to handle failures?  I posit that the decision is based on the expectation one has when calling the function that can fail.

An Either type should be used if you don't have a clear expectation either way.  That is, the function call would succeed about as often as fail. In this case you have to have a strategy how to deal with both cases as part of your main requirements.

A (checked) Exception should be used if there is a clear expectation of the function call succeeding, but this expectation is not overwhelming.  In this case you still need to have a strategy how to deal with this situation, but it does not need to be part of the main description of the implemented functionality (i.e. what you would put in a docstring).

And finally Errors would be used in a situation where there is an overwhelming expectation of the function call succeeding, but of course in the real world nothing is ever 100% certain.  In this case you would not normally deal with this as part of the requirements.

The canonical example is that of opening a file.  Let's say we are trying to open a user specific configuration file.  This file may or may not be there and our software runs just as well without it.  In fact most users won't need one.  In this case we have no expectation of the function call succeeding and so we would want to use an Either type to handle this situation.

On the other hand, let's say we are trying to open a file we use to store the previous session to continue it.  This file would exist unless it's the first invocation or the file was deleted manually, so we do have a clear expectation of the file existing, but not an overwhelming one.  This would be solved with a checked exception because we do need to handle it at some point by creating a default session.

And third, if we try to open a file that a user just selected in a file selector, we do have an overwhelming expectation of this file existing, and we don't need to think about what should happen if it doesn't, so we would use an Error, or unchecked exception.

The important difference between Exception and Error is, that for an Exception we do know what to do for a *specific* Exception and we don't want to handle Exceptions in a generic way, while with Errors we don't usually even care what specific Error occurred and only have a generic error handler, that would usually try to bring the system back into the last known consistent state or a default one, regardless of what happened.

One problem with dynamically typed languages is that you need to know internals of a function you are calling to know if you can call the function in the way you want.  For example if you have a function that operates on numbers, but you know it only uses +, you can also call it with strings as arguments.  Nothing in the function signature or even the docstring will tell you if that is the case, you need to read the functions source code.  And even if it turns out that you can,
the author of the function might only have tested it on integers not even floats let alone strings.  This is why testing can only ever show the presence of errors, but never the absence of errors.  Static type checking on the other hand can prove the absence of certain kinds of errors.

If an author has only declared a function argument as int, but you need to call it with a string, a static type checker will immediately tell you that the requirements for the function were incomplete (or incompletely implemented) and you can tell the author to implement and test the function for strings also.  And if the function happens to use an operation that is incompatible with strings, the static type checker will immediately tell the author that there needs to be a
special handling for strings at this point.  Without static type checking these oversights might have never been found until an important client lost all their data.

Checked exceptions are another means that could be used to find these kinds of oversights.  You could in python add a list of Exceptions to a function signature and tell a static type checker to verify the handling of these exceptions in calling functions.  E.g. by annotating a function with a tuple where the first element is the return type and all other elements are checked exceptions.

The advantage of that is not in checking the code, but in checking the requirements the code is based on.  If in one function a situation would be declared as a checked exception, but in a calling function this exception would neither be handled nor declared, this shows that the requirements for the calling function missed a situation that is likely to occur at some point but not so likely that it wouldn't slip through testing, as otherwise it would be handled with an Either.","Handling failure with Either, Exception or Error"

We have (many) java apps. We have been moving to Groovy/Spock for most of our tests and I've been mulling over the topic of boilerplate code generation. I have no particular interest in moving our main application code (Spring MVC + Spring Data + typical service layer junk) to Groovy, but am considering using it for our domain objects.

The goal here is for *something* to autogenerate the boilerplate getters/setters/equals/hash/tostring. If the tedious/trivial stuff can be autogenerated, there should be no reason the remaining ""real"" code can't be completely covered by real, meaningful tests.

The domain objects in question are largely simple objects that get mapped to json on the way out the door (or in), though some of them may be ""smart"" with some specific behavior.

Groovy benefits:

* No IDE tweaking needed (you seem to have to tweak your compiler settings or add a Lombok plugin for Lombok to work)
* For nested classes you can just define them all as top level classes in one groovy file, which may be cleaner. 

Lombok Benefits:

* Still in Java, any methods you do want to add retain the stricter compile time checking that comes with that.
* Still in Java, in that your domain classes are located near your other classes in the same source set, not deserted in /src/main/groovy

Any issues with code coverage with the above methods? Would like these autogenerated methods to not be part of the code coverage calculation - and I don't want to exclude them from our SonarQube config.",For a Java project: Lombok vs Groovy for domain object management?

By random data I mean, financial data, dates, strings, text, emails, usernames, etc, usually things that can fill up my SQL tables with something that can resemble a ""real"" user data.

I am fully aware this is not necessarily something spectacular, but it might prove some usefulness to somebody else... or not.

Basically the library allows you to:

- random values for the basic java types; 

- random time related information;

- random user information: ids, usernames, emails, names, passwords, etc.;

- random text based on [Markov Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_model).

- random data related to networking: ip addresses, mac addresses, urls, etc.

- random data for financial apps: currencies, money amounts, credit card numbers, etc.

- random geographical data: country names, cities, etc.

- construct complex collections structures and fill them with random values;

- instantiate java objects with random values (based on a set of conditions);

190,2017-03-03 12:00:35,1,0,"Hi everyone,

I am looking to expand my portfolio in order to improve my chances at getting a better job. I really want to work in an enterprise environment where I build complex backend systems using Java.

I have good knowledge of Java and I recently learnt the new JavaFX 8 GUI framework and built a desktop application that communicated with a RESTful web service. However, I have not seen any job postings that require skills in Java desktop GUI development. I believe Java isn't used in the industry for client-side GUI development?

I would like to build my own REST backend service and I want to learn skills in Java since working on enterprise backend systems in Java is the area I would like to move towards. For my portfolio needs, this includes CRUD operations on a RDBMS. I want to create a log in for users, set up their profile, and build a small community. (I Haven't decided on what this will be exactly - it won't be the next Facebook, just something small to showcase my skills in working on a decent backend system).

The problem is, I do not know where to start. I have never used Java EE and have never built a server-side application in Java (actually, I have never done any server-side development besides PHP and MySQL).

Should I learn Java EE without any of the frameworks like Spring? I know I can build web services without them:

[Java EE - Jax-RS](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gijti.html)

But is that an outdated way to build backend systems? Would learning a framework like Spring be a better choice since I see job postings mentioning Spring. What would be more impressive to a recruiter?

I have identified 3 courses on Udemy, and I would like some suggestion on which one to take to learn backend skills so I can develop my own system:

[1) Spring Framework 4.0 with Angular JS](https://www.udemy.com/java-spring-mvc-framework-with-angularjs-by-google-and-html5/)

[2) The Java EE Course - build a Java EE app from scratch](https://www.udemy.com/the-java-ee-course/)

[3) Java EE with Vaddin, Spring Boot and Maven](https://www.udemy.com/java-ee-with-vaadin-spring-boot-and-maven/)

I am having trouble deciding between these 3. The last one looks interesting since it also teaches a bit of Vaddin.

I already know iOS app development and once I build my own backend system, I will build front end systems on iOS, a C++ desktop application in Qt, and a website in HTML 5 / JS. (Although, one of the courses teaches Angular JS - this is used for front-end web development correct?).

I really want to invest time in one course at the moment, especially one which will boost my chances of getting a job as a software engineer working on a Java backend.",Help me decide on a Udemy course

I have an application where I need to watch a directory for files being created, deleted, or modified.  There may be a very large number of files in the directory, so polling isn't a good option.

[BarbaryWatchService](https://github.com/gjoseph/BarbaryWatchService) has an apparently efficient implementation native to Macs, but that requires checking the OS and picking the appropriate implementation.

There is also the fact that the WatchService API is very poorly designed, although that concern is secondary.

I'm hoping that someone has created a replacement for WatchService that is truly cross-platform, efficient, and ideally with a better-designed API.

Anyone have any pointers?

*edit:* Just found [JNotify](http://jnotify.sourceforge.net/), however it looks pretty old, and from what I've read it can still delay update notifications by several seconds.  Still, probably the best option I've found so-far (and the API's not bad).

It all started as a set of utility classes I've used to generate test data for some applications. 

**[Project Link](https://github.com/nomemory/mockneat)**

**[Bintray Link](https://bintray.com/nomemory/maven/mockneat/0.0.4)**

----

After receiving a good deal of feedback from the community (thanks!) I've decided go further with the development:

- Added a good deal of unit tests, found quite a few bugs in this process. Now the projects sits at 87% code coverage for classes and 80% for the lines of code;

- Written a [wiki](https://github.com/nomemory/mockneat/wiki), added some additional examples.

- Uploaded the project to `jcenter()`. Now `MockNeat` can be included as dependency into maven or gradle build files. 

- Added lots of new features;

---

What can you do with the library:

### Generate CSV files:

        m.fmt(""#{id},#{first},#{last},#{email},#{salary}"")
         .param(""id"", m.longSeq())
         .param(""first"", m.names().first())
         .param(""last"", m.names().last())
         .param(""email"", m.emails())
         .param(""salary"", m.money().locale(GERMANY).range(2000, 5000))
         .list(1000)
         .consume(list -&gt; {
             try { Files.write(path, list, CREATE, WRITE); }
             catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
         });


### Generate random data from regular expressions (see [regex()](https://github.com/nomemory/mockneat/wiki/MockNeat#regex)):
    
    String lolRegex = ""LOo{3}L{10,15}!"";
    String lol = mock.regex(lolRegex).val();
    // Possible Output: Possible Output: LOoooLLLLLLLLLLLLL!

### Mock complex objects using their [fields](https://github.com/nomemory/mockneat/wiki/MockNeat#reflect), [constructors](https://github.com/nomemory/mockneat/wiki/MockNeat#constructor) or [factory methods](https://github.com/nomemory/mockneat/wiki/MockNeat#factory):

Create a `T` object where, the `T` class has 3 fields: `x: String`, `y: int`, `z: boolean`:

    Test t = mock.reflect(Test.class)
                 .field(""x"", mock.strings().size(10))
                 .field(""y"", mock.ints().range(100, 200))
                 .field(""z"", mock.bools())
                 .val();
    // Possible Output: Test{x='QeBhNPZNhK', y=2, z=false}

### Generate complex structures with arbitrary data.

For example let's say we want to create a `Map&lt;String, List&lt;Map&lt;Set&lt;Integer&gt;, List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;` . I know it might never happen in real life, but only as a proof of concept:

     Map&lt;String, List&lt;Map&lt;Set&lt;Integer&gt;, List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; result
                    = m.ints()
                        // List&lt;Integer&gt;
                        .list(2)
                        // Map&lt;Set&lt;Integer&gt;, List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;
                        .mapKeys(2, m.ints().set(3)::val)
                        // List&lt;Map&lt;Set&lt;Integer&gt;, List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;&gt;
                        .list(LinkedList.class, 2)
                        // Map&lt;String, List&lt;Map&lt;Set&lt;Integer&gt;, List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
                        .mapKeys(4, m.strings()::val)
                        .val();

For allowing this ""flexibility"" i've introduced the concept of [MockUnit](https://github.com/nomemory/mockneat/wiki/MockUnits).

Hi,

I am trying to learn Python and for that I am currently tryining to rewrite some of my projects from java -&gt; python 3, just to learn how to deal with some common problems, like memory management. 

following situation:
my current problem includes creating a memory effienct data structure, similar to a java HashMap&lt;Integer, ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;.  The function, I wrote, reads a SQLite table, containing key/value pairs and writes them into the hashmap. A key can have multiple values, thats why i used an ArrayList for the hashmap values.

In java, all I did was basically this: 
https://pastebin.com/X0vUAMKv

There may be some most efficient way (frameworks) of doing this, but it performed good enough, for my purpose.  Took about 20min and ~12GB of memory to write the whole db into the memory / hashmap. 
~ 6 mil Keys with avg. 70 values per key. 
Total: 508 mil. key-value pairs.


Python lists are equivalent to Java linkedlist(as far as I understood), therefore is a dict of lists not an option. --&gt; uses way to much memory, because of pointers. 

python and numpy arrays aren't made to be filled gradually, if I am correct. 

the basic procedure, I am trying to do, is this:

loop: 
-get row from sqlite select (key-value pair)
-in the data-structure: append value to key -&gt; if key absent, add key, then append value

I need a dict-like strucutre, because of constant-time complexity for getting values for a key. 

What am I missing ?

Ok, so you are open to new ideas? Great.

For some reason I have been very passionate about reproducible, incremental and otherwise high-quality builds all my career as a java programmer. I have tried several tools (make, ant, maven, ...), written several of them and learned by making several mistakes. And since 2009 I have finally distilled my learnings as http://iwant.sourceforge.net

An extra short version: iwant is an expressive and high-performing java DSL for defining builds using fluent java.

I have used iwant from day one myself, and gradually in several projects of my employers and colleagues. But now I've finally realized there may be people out there who have suffered (as I did before I wrote iwant) from unnecessarily suboptimal build systems and who might actually appreciate it if I get my ass up and let them know about iwant :)

So, please go visit the project page to read more about why you would want to build your stuff with iwant. Try it out. Ask me for help. Tell your friends and colleagues about it.

And/or argue with me about iwant and build tool philosophy. Or educate me how I should promote the project.

I don't understand what the use case for this is over just the standard Java formatting and printing. You have to learn a fairly large API, the code is very verbose, and it isn't very clear what the code you are generating does. Plus you have yet another build dependency that can have its own bugs and issues. So the code comes out a little nicer with proper indentation, but you can also use your editor or code formater. 

What am I missing on this? I would post a link to the repo, but I don't want people thinking I'm picking on his code. The code is very clean, but I just don't do whole enterprisey thing very well.",What is the purpose of JavaPoet?

289,2017-04-11 17:13:44,2,3,"Hey reddit, 
 I'm designing a string algorithm and the problem lies in the size of the input. By definition Java's maximum string length is 2147483647, to avoid confusion ~2.15x10^9. 

 Manacher's algorithm requires, by definition an array of characters: 

 char[n*2 +3] where n is the length of the input (string of size n)

By definition the maximum integer is the mentioned above ~2.15kkk, so an array of characters can be of max size 

char [ ~2.15kkk ];

 This computation of manachers algorithm in java, lowers the limit of the inputed string to n = (~2.15kkk - 3) / 2 . To be accurate thats exactly 1073741822. ~1.1kkk.

 A char array of maximum length has (n*2) + 32 bytes =
( ~2.1kkk * 2 ) + 32 bytes = ~4.2kkk bytes (4.2GBs)

 Theres additional arrays of various sizes, sets and other collections. I believe this will make the program take an entire space of ~~30GBs. for maximal input of RAM memory for the computation of the algorithm which we identified to be at most ~1.1kkk characters long.

 Could you advice me on some technique to keep things even between ""Longest possible string input"" and ""Memory management"" ? Thank you

291,2017-04-12 03:50:09,31,73,"A while back I posted an update on my Java-based space 4X game where I had managed to create galaxies of up to 50,000 stars -- almost two orders of magnitudes more than what you see in commercial games, generally created with Unity.

Some of you were impressed and many of you were not, which is ok! I nevertheless continued on with the performance tuning and eventually wrapped up the latest alpha which can now generate galaxies over 1 million stars in the same amount of heap as before. In addition, whereas 50K stars used to take 30 seconds to generate, it now takes only 2-3. And when I specify the full 16G of RAM from the command line, I can generate and play in a galaxy of 4M stars. Seems insane!

Link here: https://remnantsoftheprecursors.com/2017/04/09/alpha-3-is-now-available/

Anyway, what I would like to do is share some of my lessons learned from this effort in case anyone else is trying to make their Java applications more performant.

My approach was to gradually step up the max galaxy size and tackle problems as they appeared.

**Lesson 1: You think you know where the problem is, but profile anyway.** 
Obviously the nature of my application made profiling difficult, and I resorted to sprinkling logs with before/after times over increasingly granular blocks of code. It turns out at the actual performance problems were rarely where I expected. My wife laughed more than once when I would ask myself out loud, something like ""why is *this* taking 75 milliseconds?""

**Lesson 2: Meticulously avoid excessive object creation.**
There is a tremendous amount of memory overhead with Java object creation and, despite what people want to believe, allocating and reclaiming memory is expensive! If you don't need an object right away, create it lazily. If two objects share a 1:1 relationship and you need a million of them, combine them into a single object. If you're up for it, draw your GUIs with paintComponent() rather than building them. Honestly, I think the OO rules I broke in this step did more to improve the performance than anything else. My game is now efficient enough with memory that I can create a 70K galaxy on a Raspberry Pi.

**Lesson 3: Use primitives as much as possible.** 
Perhaps this is a corollary to the 2nd lesson, but once I assigned index ids to certain voluminous objects, I could just pass those integers around. list.contains(obj) became a thing of the past as I just random-accessed objects out of arrays. This is a big deal when those lists have over a million items.

I understand that a lot of this sounds like heresy on r/java and for that I apologize, but throwing out a lot of OO theory when writing my code is what really sped shit up. I can't lie about that. 

Maybe in a couple of years, I'll be posting about this project r/c_programming, lol. OK, not really, but still this whole process has shaken a lot of my confidence in the OO paradigm.","Lessons learned from my latest game iteration, from 50K stars to over 1M"

389,2017-04-29 12:21:12,8,5,"Two years ago, I created a java html builder, which I named [j2html](https://j2html.com/). I didn't pay a lot of attention to it after the initial two releases, but earlier this year I logged into sonatype and checked the download stats. I was surprised to learn that tens of thousands of people use the project, and it seems to be gaining traction (2k+ downloads in march). If thousands of people want to use j2html (for whatever reason), I want to improve the project, so I've picked up development a bit lately.


### Question 1

Today I made a change that I'm not sure about. I overloaded every tag-method to take a number of tags. On the surface it looks pretty nice:

    // old
    html().with(
        body().with(
            main().with(
                h1(""Heading!"")
            )
        )
    )
    
    // new
    html(
        body(
           main(
               h1(""Heading!"")
           )
        )
    )
    
But there are some problem with how you should handle cases where tags have attributes: 

    // old
    html().withClass(""html"").with(
        ...
    )
    
    // new
    html(
        ...
    ).withClass(""html"")
    
You could use a mix of **with()** and not **with()**. It would be up to users to decide, I'm not removing the old **with()** method. Any thoughts?

### Question 2
People have been requestion java7 and java6 support. I won't change the project for this, but I could release it as, for example **1.0.0-java6**. Are there any downsides to this?

### Question 3
I don't use j2html myself, if anyone here does I would love to get some comments on why, and what you use it for. Are there any changes I could do to make it easier to work with?

### Question 4
General feedback welcome!",j2html - feedback wanted
390,2017-04-29 14:22:37,0,1,,Best java libraries of 2017
391,2017-04-29 14:22:41,5,2,"I'm a relatively experienced java developer but I'm unfamiliar with writing web applications. I'm currently facing the task to expose the functionality of one of our libraries through a RESTfull interface so it can be used in a website. I've started an educational journey which started at servlets and ended up at spring boot and dropwizard.

My head is spinning from the amount of information that is available up to the point that I need a little help with deciding which route to take. (Seriously, I've downloaded the documentation of these things and most of them are over 1k pages. I've spent three entire days reading documentation...) What needs to be done is the following: we have an existing java library which does some computation. It can be executed from the command line and actually has only one function. Some parameters go in and a large stream of data comes out. Now, we want to have a website which consists of a graphical editor to set the parameters and a visual component to render the resulting data stream. 

As I understand, I have many options on how to get this done, but I'm stuck between a few options. Given that the our lib to be exposed is in java and that the machine on which we aim to host this website already runs wildfly, I was considering a java web application approach. 

I could stick to the absolute basics and write a servlet which basically calls our lib and parses the output to json. The view can then be done in any other way, e.g. using angular, writing HTML by hand,... and using jquery to call the servlet. This approach seems very basic yet flexible and shifts the emphasis to web development (HTML, css...). 

I could also use a more complete package and write the view in JSF as a facelet. This allows me to use primefaces or any other library to develop a rich UI which is very tightly coupled to java code. This seems less flexible and with slightly less emphasis on web development and more on java code. 

I could also choose to use an entire framework like spring boot to expose our lib. Though this is very easy, I personally fear this is an overkill for our specific case as really we only want to expose one service. Basically, i think that we would end up using spring boot just to run a single servlet anyway, so why not just write the servlet directly and package it as a minimal war?

Then there is the option of using a different framework like dropwizard. It's still unclear to me why to choose for dropwizard over spring boot. In fact, I'm not sure if for our simple case we should even go for a full fledged framework. 

Anyone with experience in java web application development care to enlighten me? :)",Exposing functionality through a web service

403,2017-04-29 23:04:01,6,9,"I'm a big fan of both the Kotlin Language and the Vim Editor, but it seems to me that they don't quite play nice together at this current point. There is the [kotlin-vim](https://github.com/udalov/kotlin-vim) plugin, which provides nice syntax highlighting, but for some reason I have found its Syntastic syntax check support to be very slow (~3second to save/load usually). 

With java, I find myself rarely needing to leave vim to use Eclipse or another IDE, because of the excellent [javacomplete2](https://github.com/artur-shaik/vim-javacomplete2) plugin which provides eclipse-style completion and code generation features.

Unfortunately, no such plugin exists for Kotlin, which seems much more 'tied' to IntelliJ IDEA as an IDE (which it works wonderfully for).

Anyways, I was just wondering if you guys had similar problems or knew of some kotlin/vim tips i am missing. Thanks!","People writing Kotlin in Vim, share your workflow."

Does anyone have any experience with anaconda for python? It seems to be unrelated to the anaconda package manager, which is quite confusing. I've been reading threads about all the different IDEs (pydev, pycharm, jupyter, etc) but haven't been able to figure out what'd be best for an intermediate user on a Mac. Right now I'm mostly writing flask or django code.

I think I want a lightweight program (not unlike sublime), but also some features like pep linting and what not. I used to use eclipse for java, but it sounds like it'd be a pretty bloated program to use for python.

#Original Post:

Hello! I'm trying to find a method to make the following dated Java application available in a straightforward, non-browser-dependent manner to a group of students in a computer lab:

https://wright.nasa.gov/airplane/tunnlint.html

It's a really neat little simulation, but due to security restrictions it's become a nightmare to run in modern browsers, online or offline. The source code to it is available in the zip archive as `Foil.java`, using some of the `.gif` format images in the program itself (beyond the forms and tables, which are merely displayed on an HTML page). My end goal is to have this program available in some form that doesn't necessitate browser workarounds or security exceptions. 

The workstations can all run a recent JRE locally; however I haven't been able to get the code to run on my system even with the JDK and IntelliJ installed (though I'm not very proficient with Java at all).  What would be the best way to go about this project?

Thank you in advance!

*Edit:* It looks like I can just call the HTML file locally via `appletviewer`! I can distribute the offline files and `appletviewer.exe` to the workstations, then place a batch file on their desktop that calls the viewer with the desired content. This seems like a reliable long-term solution and has everything working nicely.

----

#Working Solution (edited 06/05)

In case anyone else would like to use this for a Windows classroom or lab, I've bundled it together as a batch script that can be pushed out to workstations via PDQDeploy or SCCM. The `Windtunnel_install.bat` script creates a `C:\Java` folder with the project files, the `appletviewer.exe` from the JDK and the prerequisite `jli.dll`. This allows it to run standalone without installing the whole JDK and path settings on each system. 

**Update**: I've added a small pyinstaller-compiled launcher that can run all of the applets on the site. You can easily customize it for your own use, the source code is here:

https://gist.github.com/Kibbles/3016367843a166faaa44443abd9ac354

The `windtunnel_install.bat` now simply creates a desktop shortcut to the launcher, which includes all the applets.

i cannot edit the title, it should be actually java/rest GUI

i have a great program which i am used to use via console. 
But because I implement more and more features I switched to JavaFX.

But this is now also not enough. I want to have all the GUI running in a browser, so I can access my program via PC, Android and iOS.

Since I never had any contact with these frameworks I hope someone can help me here and recommend something.

580,2017-05-08 14:46:54,9,42,"The topic of game programming in Java comes up often enough that, as a small group of developers who enjoy the Java language and its available toolsets, we like to show what's possible for a small team of people (almost entirely 1 person in this case).  


We develop everything in [JMonkey Engine](jmonkeyengine.org), which is an open-source 2D and 3D game engine written in Java (but with support for some other languages as well).  It uses OpenGL for the rendering pipeline, supports native Bullet and the JBullet java port, and has quite a few other capabilities out of the box as well( [full list of features here](https://jmonkeyengine.github.io/wiki/jme3/features.html) )


Our lead developer stumbled across the engine when working on his high school capstone project, and over time a few more members joined in.  Due to the accessibility of Java and its prominence as a starter language in schools, it has the benefit of a large userbase.  On top of that, the graphical capabilities of OpenGL and GLSL are pretty stellar

[Example 2: Animated turrets. Animated model created in blender, particle effects in GLSL and collision testing with JBullet](https://i.imgur.com/zUYwC8M.gif)


[Example 3: Tracking system with UI overlay in open-source ""Lemur"" framework, lasters with bloom post-processing filter and animated with GLSL](http://www.lightspeedfrontier.com/uploads/5/4/7/1/5471202/brahalala_orig.gif)


There aren't many games on Steam that are written primarily in Java, let alone 3D games, so we're kind of an island there but so far I don't think many people even realize we're using Java unless they check out the source folders.  There is even a Java port of all of the Steamworks APIs that we have been using, [which can be found here](https://github.com/code-disaster/steamworks4j)

So I just wanted to drop this here for any other Java developers who are looking for play around with 3D game development, or who are just interested in picking through some of the engines source code.  Java is especially useful when it comes to ambitious small teams who want to just make something cool looking or fun!",Pushing the limits of 3D Game programming with Java

763,2017-05-15 09:35:34,0,3,,Running java on Docker images on your Mac – A getting started guide
764,2017-05-15 12:09:27,6,24,"A couple of days ago I helped a coworker fight some strange issue reading a Json string into a List&lt;SomeDTO&gt;. We knew we need to pass a `TypeReference` to tell Jackson the generic information lost because of type erasure. We had problems getting the code to compile until we realize we were using a class named TypeReference from an internally developed library instead of Jackson `TypeReference`. Automatic imports are annoying sometimes.

Reflecting on that later, I realize there are several different implementations of the same trick:

 * Google Guava has `com.google.common.reflect.TypeToken`
 * Google guice has `com.google.inject.TypeLiteral`
 * Google Gson has `com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken`
 * Jackson has `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.type.TypeReference`
 * Apache Commons Lang has `org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.TypeLiteral`
 * JEE has `javax.enterprise.util.TypeLiteral`
 * And of course, some internal library in my company has 
`com.mycompany.whatever.utils.TypeReference`

I'm sure there must be more implementations around.
Google Guava seems to have the most powerful implementation with TypeToken that allows several methods I'm not sure I understand.
On the other hand, they have 3 different classes.

Everyone is rolling his own version, because nobody wants to force you to download an extra dependency just for a simple abstract class.

I think this is kind of ridiculous, and can be simply avoided just by having a nice class `java.lang.reflect.TypeLiteral`

I understand if we have reified generics we shouldn't need `TypeLiteral` at all, and we could write something like `List&lt;SomeDTO&gt;.class`, but I don't know if there is a roadmap to reified generics in Java 10 or we are only going to keep type erasure around forever, so I think it will be useful to have `java.lang.reflect.TypeLiteral`

What do you think?",Do you think we should have a TypeLiteral class in the Java library?

885,2017-05-19 21:58:45,4,9,"I have taken a class on Machine Architectures, in that class we were learning and writing our assignments in a “language” called JAS(or as the prof said Java Assembly). While looking at the [Java compilation process](http://i.imgur.com/KhUw309.png) [online](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17511931/what-exactly-is-bytecode) the high-level of the compilation process is the following:


.java =&gt; COMPILER =&gt; .class (bytecode) =&gt; JVM(INTERPRETER) = &gt; Machine Native Code


This is where I got confused, since no articles/image mention JAS or IJVM.

In class, we would write [JAS](http://www.ontko.com/mic1/jas.html) code, then use a [Mic-1](http://cs.mvnu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/Lab2Arch2014) software, which is supposed to be some sort of Java simulator (whatever that means, if you could explain what it should be that would also be great), Mic-1 would convert our .jas file into a .ijvm file, which would be equivalent to the machine instructions of the [virtual CPU](https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~prabakar/cda4101/Common/notes/figs/ijvm-data-path.gif) in Mic-1 and then Mic-1 would execute the code in .ijvm file.

The problem is, I did my assignment, memorized a bunch of stuff, but have no clue what in the world I was doing.

Looking at the bycode on Google images, it seems to be somewhat similar to the code found in .ijvm files, I need help getting my head around all this information and how it all fits together, is bytecode same as .ijvm code? Is JAS even a thing? Is IJVM and JAS code something found in JVM?. 

If something is not clear, please let me know and I will try to provide more details.

Thank you.",How does the Java compilation process work? What is JAS?

What do you think, is it the correct language? I've spent some time over the years trying to learn random languages and just getting a basic understanding of what code is. Now that I have some ideas of exactly what kind of program I want to create I hope I can turn it into something. 

Some of the things I want to have are basic commands like when you highlight your mouse over a certain part of the screen it lights up makes a sound and is clickable to another section of your game and things like dialogue are super important for this project. I want to be able to type things up live and other somewhat ambitious ideas. Anyways shoot some thoughts reddit...",I'm thinking of jumping into Java as my first code for a specific purpose

The project is becoming more and more stable, having 93% classes and 85% lines of code covered by more than 541 Unit Tests.

Recently I've tested how feasible is to use MockNeat in order to generate data for a ""real-world"" SQL Schema that has ""complex"" relationships between tables (like a few foreign keys). This data is generated as SQL Inserts.

Often I see experienced Java developers asking us to develop the system using Interfaces rather than starting with classes. Yes, I do create interfaces, I know whats its usecases are etc. However the term ""design your system using interfaces"" is somewhat confusing to me.

I am writing a spring boot based REST API - with a Separate Rest API which will sit behind a firewall, for the purpose of managing the payments side of the product.

Now, what I really want to know, is how this whole idea behind containerization works? I've tried to read up on it, but I really could use some information.

What I would like to do, is build out these containers, and have it so that I can scale the environment by deploying more and more containers as needs be. Then - I would assume I can use something like KAFKA to manage all of the incoming requests to these instances? Right?

Now, that said, I have found it very hard to get a concise write up on how I might achieve this, what running it looks like, and what kind of infrastructure would be needed.

I would really appreciate some advice - and I realize this is not a java specific question, but my application is written in java, and uses a framework which is considered a standard in the java world - so I figured y'all will have worked with this problem in the past.

The code works with 8u131 on two separate Windows 10 machines, one running educational, the other was a laptop pre-install. So I've ruled out the code being the source of the error. 

I also tried sfc /scannow.

 I really don't want to reinstall Windows on this machine. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

1137,2017-05-29 18:54:23,11,5,"Hi all,

I'm looking for some intermediate/advanced books on JS. So far I've read:

* Eloquent Javascript
* You Don't Know JS (apart from the ES6 book)
* Javascript: The Good Parts
* Javascript with Promises
* Programming Javascript Applications
* Effective Javascript: 68 ways...
* Javascript Application Design: A Build-first Approach
* Learning Javascript Design Patterns
* (Most of) Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming
* (Currently half-way through) Javascript Allonge (ES6 Ed)

And probably a few more I've forgotten to list.

These seem to be the only ones commonly recommended, so I'm looking for recommendations for anything a bit more obscure that you found a useful? Or anything that focuses on something a bit different, such as design patterns, systems-level stuff, etc?

I also wonder if the general ""programming books"" that are commonly recommended, such as Clean Code, GoF Design Patterns, Code Complete, etc have been useful to any JS devs that have read them? I read the Pragmatic Programmer recently, and while I totally recommend it, not knowing any java made some bits difficult to get through.

Also, any solid books on Node? 

Cheers!

1138,2017-05-29 21:31:09,3,5,"I just started using Kotlin a few days ago and I'm trying to achieve something relatively simple. 

    abstract class BaseActivity&lt;T : BaseViewModel&gt; : LifecycleActivity(){
        protected val vm : T by lazy {
            ViewModelProviders.of(this).get(T::class.java)
        }
    }

I am presented with the error
&gt; Cannot use 'T' as a reified type parameter. Use a class instead

The current solution I am using is to make an abstract val Class&lt;T&gt; that I just specify in its children:

    abstract class BaseActivity&lt;T : BaseViewModel&gt; : LifecycleActivity() {
        protected abstract val classToken: Class&lt;T&gt;
        protected val vm : T by lazy {
            ViewModelProviders.of(this).get(classToken)
        }

Is there a more straight-forward way to achieve this?",Retrieving generic class?

In [Processing](https://processing.org) (a java-based programming language oriented to visual arts), it's incredibly easy to create standalone applications. It's just [a two-click task](https://reddit-uploaded-media.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/images%2Ft2_xsd4s%2Fj1np80cip71z). It couldn't be easier.

I wonder why this isn't possible in Python. My knowledge of Python is very limited, but I understand that a Python program could be much more complex, especially when complex libraries (like numpy) are involved. But, anyway, I would be very, very happy if this option existed, even if you could use only a limited subset of Python. Am I the only one that thinks that this limits the use of Python in the desktop?

I would like to give my students small Python programs to do some calculations, but it's asking too much to ask them (and me) to install Python. A mixture of old laptops, crapware, different versions of Windows make that task too difficult and too time-consuming, just to run a few small programs. They aren't learning how to program. I have to say that, in this moment, I don't have the motivation to mount a server and use the web. 

Thanks for reading.",Why is it so hard to make a standalone application using Python?

1341,2017-06-10 11:28:29,8,11,"Two weeks ago I released a library called [Javalin](https://javalin.io/), which has seen two major changes since I posted here. Last week I rewrote the core to Kotlin, this week I changed the main api from being based on **request/response**, to just being based on **context**. This is what I would like feedback on:

    app.get(""/"", (req, res) -&gt; res.body(""Hello World""));

    // has been changed to

    app.get(""/"", ctx -&gt; ctx.body(""Hello World""));


At first I was skeptical of the change, but ktor, phoenix, koa, etc, use this approach, and it's starting to mentally make sense to me.

I've currently structured it so that all getters **body()**, **header(name)**, **cookie(name)** operate on the underlying request, while all setters **body(content)**, **header(name, value)**, **cookie(name, value)** operate on the underlying response.

Internally the architecture makes more sense, as I had some methods that seemed out of place on req/res, such as **req.next()** and **res.json()**.

Any thoughts?

This is a subjective question. How was your experience in moving to python from java background? I am  one of those peoples. One of the python's motto is 'explicit is better than implicit.' I find this motto more utilized in java rather than python where you have many different ways of doing a single task. Also since it's an interpreted language and dynamically typed. So, I often don't get how memory representation is done internally, so on and so forth.

I find python to  be more idiomatic however. Examples like list slicing and indexing, boolean indexing and so on. I often find myself not utilizing these python features and reverting back to java style a lot of times.

1457,2017-07-25 15:44:35,131,55,"I primarily work with Android but even after working with kotlin for pure JVM projects, I'm so impressed with the few ""tweaks"" that are available that I don't know if I'll go back to Java unless I have to. 


The main things coming to mind that got me hooked are 


  1. Reified generics.  It's possible in kotlin to declare an inline function with type parameters and upon calling it - you can keep the type information (on the return value)

  2.  Collections QOL improvements.  With Java 8 and default/static  interface methods, I'm wondering why 8 or at least 9 didn't go as far as kotlin did when changing collections &amp; streams


Inb4 ""shill"" comments, I'm still a big supporter of all JVM technologies and Java.  Kotlin just showed me how far you can go with full interoperability.  I'd be really happy if the List interface supported a direct map function without creating a stream, for example.  

Is there any OpenJDK projects which are working on anything like these smaller ""QOL"" changes? Java 9 and Valhalla seem (understandably) to suggest the focus is elsewhere for the future.  Also, if you work with Java, what is your employers outlook on it? (i.e. has anyone ever been given a green light to switch between the two)",What are your thoughts as a java developer on kotlin?

1460,2017-07-26 20:37:29,13,5,"I am working on a project where we have some core code that ""executes"" code generated by a separate product.

In order to isolate instances which we are executing and to allow for the code to be cached, then dumped if necessary (to avoid reloading jars, classes, etc. and to prevent memory from growing unbounded), we currently use custom class loaders which only load the codes in the specific classes provided to the system and load our code, java libs, etc. with the system loader.

Additionally, we have different versions of our core code that we must support, so we also create class loaders to load these different versions in an isolated manner (on top of which, we use custom loaders as described above).

This, more or less, works as expected, but I am starting to wonder if we would be better off using something like OSGi. Conceptually, I think it is ideal, but we load/unload a *very* large number of jars in this manner (hundreds or thousands of different jars at any given time might be cached) so it's important that we can *quickly* load and unload.

So, is the overhead from using OSGi likely to cause significant overhead which would make it difficult to support several loads/unloads per second, for instance? 

If it's not ideal, then are there any other lightweight frameworks that might work well in this context?

Or are custom classloaders really going to always beat out any such frameworks?",Performance of OSGi vs Custom ClassLoaders

1477,2017-08-04 18:43:05,6,7,"Ok, so a few questions rolled into one here. It all started with an effort to do this Java expression in Kotlin:

    ZipEntry entry = null;
    while((entry = zipStream.getNextEntry()) != null){
        System.out.println(entry.getName());
    }

There are several issues I've run into trying to make this work in Kotlin. I'll go through them in order.

**1) Assignment is not an Expression**

The declaration in that while loop doesn't work in Kotlin. The compiler won't allow it. I've searched the web and found a few possible worarounds, so I would call this the least significant of my issues.

However, if anyone knows the commonly accepted Kotlin-style idiom for working on this kind of while() loop, that would be appreciated.

**2) java.lang.IllegalStateException: this.nextEntry must not be null**

This one scares me more. With ZipInputStreams in Java, you keep calling getNextEntry() until an entry is null to signify you're at the end of the stream. However, a call to .nextEntry in Kotlin that returns null causes this IllegalArgumentException.

That seems to indicate one of two things: either I'm missing something Kotlin has changed about the ZipInputStream class, or this is a SERIOUS defect in the language. If unable to check for null, or worse to have to use that exception as an indicator that I've reached the end, Kotlin is significantly hampering my ability to handle items like the ZipInputStream.

**Conclusion**

Any advice on these issues would be great. Thank you so much.

**Edit**

Ok, so I'm going to answer question 2 for myself. I realized the issue in my Kotlin code was my variable assignment. I was doing:

    var entry: ZipEntry = zipStream.nextEntry
    ...
    while({ entry = zipStream.nextEntry; entry }() != null){
        ...
    }

The problem was that my ""entry"" variable could not accept a null value, not that zipStream.nextEntry was the problem. When I made it nullable:

    var entry: ZipEntry? = ...

Everything worked.

Interesting, I will remember this for next time.","ZipInputStream - Iteration, idioms, and Java methods that return null"

Attempt #1 - Closer to Java Way

            if (this === other) return true
            if (other?.javaClass != javaClass) return false
    
            other as Client
    
            if (id != other.id) return false
            if (name != other.name) return false
    
            return true
        }
    
        override fun hashCode(): Int {
            var result = id?.hashCode() ?: 0
            result = 31 * result + name.hashCode()
            return result
        }
    }

Attempt #2 Using Data classes and immutability

    @Entity
    @Table(name = ""client"", schema = ""timesheet"")
    data class DataClient(
    
        @Id
        @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
        val id: Long? = null,
    
        @Column(name = ""name"")
        val name: String,
    
        @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy = ""client"", cascade = arrayOf(CascadeType.ALL))
        val projects: List<Project> = emptyList()) {
        
        fun addProject(project: Project): DataClient {
            projects.toMutableList().add(project)
            return this.copy(projects = projects)
        }
    }

Although this approach looks cleaner I don't like that now the caller can set and ID, which they shouldn't be able to, and they can set the projects, which they really shouldn't be able to do either.

`new URL(String)` only works if the URL class is able to resolve the correct `URLStreamHandler` for the protocol. It may not be able to do that. Even then, it assumes that all instances of the `URLStreamHandler` for a certain protocol are created equal.

URLs like `file:`, `http:` and `jar:` might work, but what about `myfunkycheme://instanceid/path`?

If you have a working `URL`, it already has the correct instance of the correct `URLStreamHandler`. `.toString()` loses this information.

The correct way to create a `URL` from a `String` is to pass a context `URL` to the `URL(URL context, String spec)` constructor. This way, it uses the same `URLStreamHandler` from the context `URL`.

one of the things i liked about unit tests in node was that you can describe your test blocks 

    describe('Hello world', function () {
      it('says hello', function () {
        expect(helloWorld()).toEqual('Hello world!');
      });
      it('says hello in spanish', function() {

      });
      it('says hello in spanish', function() {
         expect(byeSpanish()).toEqual('Adios')
      }
    });


and with that, you can have individual functionality for beforeEach and afterEach tests (i.e you run some logic block before each test, and after each ""it"" test..say instantiating a class). In addition, you can nest describes for even better functionality.


Now couple that with spys you got a pretty robust functionality for testing.

I have been building some AWS lambda functions that i want to unit test, but have yet to find anything remotely close to what i want (or atleast close to the functionality of node)

the most I was able to gather from online was using nosetests (again documentation was a bit lacking)

and my current unit tests look a bit like this:
    
     def test_return_snstopic(self):
            CFT['Mappings']['Environments']['dev']['SNSTopic'] = 'XYZ'
            cftClass = cftTemplateParser(CFT, 'path/to/VISA_FILE')
            self.assertEqual(cftClass.getSNSTopic(), 'XYZ')
    

to the best of my ability, i havent found a way to mock a package (i want to mock aws boto3 calls)
or better yet to spy on those mocked calls to ensure they are called with params i am expecting. nor have i found ways to do ""before each test...do X"" and ""after each test...do y"".

For example, Ruby's rubygems has ""gem install X"" and NodeJS' npm has ""npm install X"". These commands do a number of things:

1. They download and install X from the relevant package repository
2. They download and install all dependencies of X
3. They add any scripts from X to your path

So whilst there are many command line tools for Java, I feel that there are some missing pieces compared to other ecosystems.

I think it should be quite easy for a Java tool to be able to:

1. Download an artifact from Maven central (or whatever repositories have been configured in the user's settings.xml)
2. Via the artifacts pom.xml, recursively download all dependencies
3. Construct the runtime classpath from the artifact and it's dependencies
4. Retrieve the main method from the jar's MANIFEST.MF or use logic similar to Spring Boot's Maven Plugin to automatically locate the main method
5. Add wrapper batch and shell scripts to a location on your PATH that execute the artifact, using the determined classpath and main method. Any command line arguments are just passed straight on to the underlying artifact.

As a tool author, this would mean that you wouldn't really need to do much to distribute your tool. You wouldn't need to mess around with fat jars. You wouldn't need to include any installation instructions on how to add the tool to the user's path. You wouldn't need to write your own batch and shell scripts if you want users to avoid having to type ""java -jar ...""

As a tool user, you would have a single command to run that gets you your command line tool, just like in Ruby and NodeJS.

I've mostly written this tool already and am wondering if it is worth open sourcing and releasing? What do you think? Is there already something like this in Java that I've missed?",Would you find a command line wrapper helpful?

I'm feeling really stupid asking this, mainly because I'm just not sure if this is just me screwing up or if there is indeed something wrong and I should post an issue over at zzprojects.

here is the thing, I just want to use this example here, picked up from their actual tutorial site:  
http://html-agility-pack.net/from-browser

I'm basically just using the first example displayed there. Yet upon build it keeps saying it cant find a reference to System.Windows.Forms to use the LoadFromBrowser - method.

I've clearly added this library to my project, its even set to copy into the targetfolder upon build, so I have no real idea why it keeps saying this.

I'm just learning C# so I might oversee something, but the details on the exception-window is showing this:

http://i.imgur.com/it9q0JD.jpg

1) is the exact exception  
2) bothers me a bit, do I read that correct, that the HAP-library tries to access this path? This is not on my computer, seems like a falsely set path in their code, more like a path on the dev's workstation.

Also, the using System.Windows.Forms; statement is greyed out and marked as not necessary -&gt; ???  
Very confusing.

What I'm trying to do: Downloading websites that have some dynamic content, so standard methods will return only incomplete DOMS. Ive written the app a year ago with some very cumbersome, convoluted method I picked up at stack overflow. It worked but doesnt really anymore so I started to rewrite the code and revisited HAP while doing so.  
The LoadFromBrowser method seemed to be a perfect fit given what it promises...I just cant get it to work.

If you cant help on that specific part, whats the current meta on scraping websites that need time to process some serverside java or whatever they are doing over there.  
Is there any other elegant way nowadays?

    RSA keySize &lt; 1024, DSA keySize &lt; 1024, EC keySize &lt; 224

From what I'm seeing, the difference between this and the previous version of this line is the addition of ""SHA1 jdkCA &amp; usage TLSServer"". Following that update one of our enterprise applications stopped working, and we would get this error ""java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: oracle.forms.engine.Main""  

Eventually I found out that removing the added portion of that line restored the functionality of our application.  
I'm on the desktop group, and don't know much about what's happening server-side regarding this application (this group in particular is very closed/protective of what they're doing; someone else in desktop had to fight hard for a long time to get very limited access to this application for about a week so he could work on compatibility and processes desktop-side for our other staff), but I created and signed a deploymentruleset.jar  file that we're using to make first time access to the application as seamless as possible; people like to freak out when they get a popup by java asking if they should allow the applet to run 

To get our application working without editing that file, would I need to change something on/re-create the keystore I created to sign the .jar file, or would something on the server need to be updated or resigned?  
Here's the settings I used when I made the keystore:

IntelliJ's built-in Kotlin code formatting gets part of the way there with judicious use of the ""reformat"" command, but I don't see a way to make it as aggressive as the Google plugin. For example, if I have Java code like

    callSomeMethod(

the Google formatter will turn that into

But it's worth waiting for. This proverb taken as a benchmark, the new version of the Java EE specification should not just be good but very good. More than four years have passed since the release of the predecessor and thus the still current version 7. If you now believe that Java EE 8 is riddled with countless innovations and enhancements, you may be disappointed. The coming version is rather an evolution than a revolution. Some even speak of a maintenance release on the way to Java EE 9. Nevertheless, this version is an important milestone for the future of Java EE. But always in order ...

**Politics wherever you look**

Actually, everything started so nicely. After some disagreements had occurred with the specification of Java EE 7 and Oracle had to be accused of losing a little bit of the focus, one seemed to want to do better with Java EE 8. Already shortly after the final release of Java EE 7, a panel with the notable title ""Java EE - Meet the Spec Leads"" was held at the JavaOne Conference 2013, which discussed extensively the future orientation of Java EE.

All agreed that the community should play a greater role in determining the future direction in order to prevent late directional changes, as happened with Java EE 7. To ensure this, a second public survey was launched, involving around 5,000 interested parties. Part 1 of the survey, conducted in December 2013, looked at meaningful new APIs and a general assessment of hype issues such as NoSQL or HTML5. In January 2014, Cloud, Microservices, Security, Logging and Deployment were also discussed. The result at that time was clear. The community focused on ""lightweight"" and ""easy to use"". Cloud and co. New UI technologies seemed to be of lesser interest. API candidates such as JSON Binding, Java EE Configuration or JCache received a response of 60% to 80%. The same was true for focusing on an alignment of the use of CDI within the many existing Java EE APIs. Proposals for cloud-related topics, on the other hand, rarely exceeded 50%. The future roadmap of Java EE thus seemed clear.

# Introduction

For the past months we've been busy on the next release of Zircon. There were much feedback to process and also several
feature requests so we are now proud to present you version `2017.2.0`.

## Why Zircon?

Zircon started out as a simplified version of Lanterna (which is doing a lot of stuff to achieve terminal emulation which is
not the focus of Zircon). After a little bit of research it turned out that there are no text GUI libraries for Java which
support what we wanted like extensibility, support for multiple GUI platforms (Swing, libGDX, etc), custom font support and such.

### The main pain points in other libraries we wanted to work around

- No dirty checking, everything is redrawn after a refresh
- Deep integration into Java2D, no simple way to write a libGDX version
- Not extensible, classes have no clear separation of concerns
- Not themeable
- No built-in fonts and no easy-to use way to add one
- No CP437 tilesets (like the ones used for Dwarf Fortress)
- No clean API
- No support for loading `.ttf` files
- Clunky components
- No scrolling
- No javadoc and no documentation
- Does not work on Mac
- No animations

&gt; (I have to commend Lanterna here. Its codebase is excellent and supports all kinds of fancy stuff but there was no way to
&gt; easily add libGDX support for it and it was also stuffed with terminal emulator stuff (which we don't want)).

With this new version we can now say that Zircon suffers from none of the problems mentioned above.

Here is what we have achieved compared to the previous release:

## Release notes

&gt; You can consult the [README](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/README.md) or the
&gt; [Wiki](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/wiki) for details about each change.
&gt; This document is intended to be a brief summary of the highlights of this release.

## API refactor
The project was refactored to an `api` and an `internal` package. From now on everything which is intended to
be user-facing can be found in the `api` package and everything else is considered to be private to Zircon.
This means that you can use anything from `api` and can only use stuff from `internal` at your own risk.

**Note** that from now on you can rely on classes in the `api` package so your code won't break. This means that
no method signatures will change (if the need arises new methods will be added) and the way they work will also not change.

## Introducing `Behavior`s
The core components of Zircon have been refactored into `Behavior`s separating their concerns into meaningful parts:

- The `Boundable` interface denotes something which has bounds in 2D space (all kinds of stuff from `Component`s to `TextImage`s)
- `Clearable` is for stuff which can be reset to a default state (like a `Terminal`)
- `CursorHandler` is for handling the cursor. `Screen` and `Terminal` are cursor handlers, but a `TextBox` is also one.
- `Drawable` and `DrawSurface` are pairs. You can `draw` any `Drawable` (like a `TextImage`) onto a `DrawSurface` (like a `Terminal`)
- `InputEmitter` is responsible for re-emitting GUI events transformed into an internal `Input` format from the underlying GUI layer (like Swing).
- `Layerable` objects support adding `Layer`s to them. Imagine this as adding a plus dimension (depth), or Z-index to an otherwise 2D surface (`Terminal`)
- `Positionable` objects can be positioned in 2D space. For example a `Layer` can be positioned over a `Terminal`
- `Movable` is an extension of `Positionable`. It lets you move its implementors over surfaces like a `Terminal`

## Animations
Zircon now supports `Animation`s. An `Animation` is basically a series of `AnimationFrame`s. Each frame consists of
a bunch of `Layer`s which are applied to a `Terminal` / `Screen`. You can use the `AnimationHandler` to run animations.
There is also a custom format for animations (`.zap`: Zircon Animation Package) which consists of a bunch of `.xp`
(REXPaint) files and some metadata (`animation.yml`) which details things like the order of the frames, repetition
and timing.

## Builders
Now every object which you can use in Zircon has either a `Builder` or a `Factory`.
This greatly enhances ease of use and also hides the internals of the library.

## The component system
A component system was introduced. Now you can put `Component`s on `Screen`s. These are the ones which are currently supported:

- `Button`
- `CheckBox`
- `Header`
- `Label`
- `Panel`
- `RadioButton` and `RadioButtonGroup`
- `TextBox`

`Component`s come in two forms: leaf objects (like a `Label`) and `Container`s (like a `Panel`). You can put `Component`s
and `Container`s in `Container`s but you can't add children to `Component`s.
There is also a simple message passing solution which is used internally to communicate between components. You can expect
all components mentioned above to work in a way which you might expect from them including focus handling. You can use
the `[Tab]` key to move the focus forward and the `[Shift]+[Tab]` key stroke to move backwards. Currently the traversal
order is defined by the order which the `Component`s are added.
All `Component`s come with the corresponding `Builder` for your convenience.

## ColorThemes
Now you can use `ColorTheme`s to pimp up your `Component`s look and feel. Zircon comes with a bunch of built-in themes
but you can build your own. `ColorTheme`s are applied recursively to all child `Component`s starting from the one you
applied the theme to.

## Fonts
Fonts have been refactored to be able to support multiple GUI frameworks. Currently there is a Swing implementation but
there is also a libGDX prototype which works (it is not published yet, because it is being fleshed out).
Fonts also have multiple variants:

- CP437 fonts are backed by a single `16x16` sprite sheet and support the CP437 characters
- Physical fonts are backed by `.ttf` files
- Graphical tilesets are backed by graphical tiles and they have their own format (currently just a `.zip` file with `.png` files and metadata)

## Graphics
The graphics package was refactored. Now it consists of:

- `Box`: represents a `TextImage` composed of box drawing characters
- `Layer`: a specialized `TextImage` which can be used with `Layerable`s
- `Shape`: an abstract representation of a shape (triangle, rectangle, etc) which consists of `Position`s only. Can be converted to a `TextImage`
- `StyleSet`: value object which holds style information (background, foreground, modifiers).
- `TextImage`: an in-memory representation of `TextCharacter`s. Can be `draw`n on `DrawSurface`s.

All of these come with the corresponding `Builder` to create them.

Shapes all have their own `*Factory` to create them: `FilledTriangleFactory`, `FilledRectangleFactory`, `LineFactory`, `RectangleFactory` and `TriangleFactory`.

## Resources
All external resource handling (fonts, animations, etc) are now handled by the corresponding `*Resource` in the `resource` package:

- `ColorThemeResource`: holds the built-in color themes. Technically not an external resource yet but will support loading themes from files later
- `CP437TilesetResource`: contains built-in tilesets (mostly from the Dwarf Fortress tileset repository). Also supports loading your own CP437 tilesets
- `GraphicTilesetResource`: can be used to load `.zip` files which contain graphic tilesets. There is an example tileset (extracted from Nethack) included. More will come later.
- `PhysicalFontResource`: contains physical fonts (OSS fonts extracted from Google Fonts) in `.ttf` file format
- `REXPaintResource`: can be used to load REXPaint files (`.xp`). Can be converted to Zircon `Layer`s.

## Miscellaneous changes

- All Swing-dependent operations were refactored in a way that now there are only 3 classes which can't be unit tested in headless mode.
  This also means that the test coverage can be greatly improved (`83%` currently)
- `Modifier`s were refactored. Now there is a `Modifier` interface and some built-in implementations of it. This means that you can create your own `Modifier`s
- `TextGraphics` was completely removed. Now you can use individual factories to create `Shape`s
- Implementation details were greatly simplified leading to the deletion of a lot of classes (like `ScreenBuffer`)
- There were also re-namings in order to achieve more meaningful names (`TerminalSize` became `Size` for example)
- The README was reworked and a Wiki was added
- An `EventBus` was introduced internally for handling component changes
- Fonts are now cached","Zircon, a text GUI library | Version 2017.2.0 released!"

I hope a lot of people are testing it with their applications and helping report bugs and such. I've been testing it with a website I've been building with playframework, and so far I've noticed:

* current versions have near openjdk performance with the default settings, while having a lot more flexibility in configuring JIT to fit the performance needs of your app
* the default gc settings result in a significantly reduced memory footprint. My website's footprint upon being fully loaded is around 1.4GB with openjdk. It's 700MB on average with openj9.
* OpenJ9 relinquishes heapspace to the OS much quicker than openjdk. I've seen it peak at 800MB used, then suddenly reduce in memory usage to 700, sometimes dipping to 650MB. It doesn't seem to hang on to heapspace as much as openjdk does...

All of these tests were done using httpress to send a ton of connections to the index of my website, so not the most scientific thing around, but i've seen these results mirrored in a lot of other benchmarks i've done comparing the two. Eventually I'd like to have some comprehensive, hard numbers comparing the two.

In any case, openJ9 is rough around the edges still, and doesn't work with every application (intellij, or sbt's interactive mode are two i'm aware of right now), and they need people to report bugs and get these issues smoothed out, so i hope interested people in r/java can and we can have the competition between openj9 and openjdk improve java's performance more and more!

edit: I'd like to mention that the openj9 team is very responsive and has been fixing bugs extremely quickly. I've reported a few bugs so far, and the performance and gc bugs discovered from those have been fixed already.","Are any of you experimenting with OpenJ9? If not, I'd suggest it!"

&gt; EE4J is not the brand
&gt; 
&gt; I think that many people are assuming that EE4J will become the brand that replaces Java EE. Wrong. Java EE is a certification mark. To label something as ""Java EE"", you need to get a license from Oracle and pass the TCKs. There are many implementations of Java EE such as WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss, and Glassfish. EE4J is the name of the top-level project at the Eclipse Foundation. As such it is the umbrella under which the source code and TCKs for Glassfish, EclipseLink, and (hopefully) Eclipse MicroProfile will exist.
&gt; 
&gt; We are months away from even starting to define the specification process that will be used in the future. However, when we do I expect that this new process will create a new certification mark which can be properly considered the new ""Java EE"" name. We will be engaging with the community in the selection of that name.
&gt; 
&gt; **The existing project names will continue to be used** 

They've also mentioned that the existing ""javax"" packages will continue to be used. New ones will have to be discussed.

1628,2017-10-11 15:46:13,8,4,"So, let's look at this code:

    public enum MyEnum {
      A(MyEnum.TEXT);
      private static final String TEXT = new String(""Hello, world!"");

      MyEnum(String type) {
        System.out.println(type);
      }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
        // just an excuse to load the class
      }
    }

No need to chastise me for it, I know this is horrible practice and a real-world situation shouldn't care what is done with this as it shouldn't exist.
My point is dicussing whether an error is legitimate and if so, when and which one.

Everything is discussed using JDK 1.8, I have not looked at 1.9 at all so far.

If I put this code in Eclipse or IntelliJ, it compiles. Running it outputs null. The variable TEXT is used before it is properly initialized, thus actually has class post-loading value null.

If I try to compile it with Oracle's official JDK (I tried several versions including most recent 1.8.0_144), it refuses to compile, with:

    MyEnum.java:4: error: illegal forward reference
        A(MyEnum.TEXT);
                ^
    1 error

So, inconsistent behaviors between compilers. Oracle's one is usually considered ""more official"" but I imagine the others pass a batshit amount of comformance tests.

Now you probably noticed that I made new String(""Hello, world!"") and you wonder why or whether I'm such a noob. I do it because otherwise the problem doesn't appear. All tested compilers give out the same results
at compile and run time: compilation success, and Hello, world! as output.

Of course the new String() stuff ensured that TEXT is not a constant, and removing it makes it a constant. Which means that at compile time MyEnum.TEXT has a known value and the access to this constant is
replaced by its known value. So no question of accessing a variable that isn't initialized yet, and results according to first glance expectations.

Now let's replace MyEnum.TEXT with just TEXT:

    public enum MyEnum {
      A(TEXT);
      private static final String TEXT = ""Hello, world!"";

      MyEnum(String type) {
        System.out.println(type);
      }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
        // just an excuse to load the class
      }
    }

This time everyone refuses to compile, constant or not.

This seems correct according to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.3.3 , ""8.3.3. Forward References During Field Initialization"", where it says that you can't use the simple name
of a variable textually before this variable is declared.

Observation 1: TEXT is a simple name sure, but MyEnum.TEXT is not. It doesn't seem to apply to the 8.3.3 section and I see no other mention of illegal forward references. When using class access of a variable
the compiler is unconcerned to decide if the class referenced is written before the current one, and the class referenced being the current class is a special case of which there is no mention.

Observation 2: There is no mention of the relevance of whether the variable is a constant or not. Which seems rather legitimate, no point in making that kind of special rules in the language.

Also note that I have to use an enum to see this problem. If I try to do something similar with this class:

    public class MyClass {

      static final String A = new String(MyClass.B);

      static final String B = new String(""Hello, World!"");

      public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(A);
      }

    }

then all compilers behave the same: compilation success, and null as output.

Can someone point out where I'm wrong in my expectations? Or what do others think about this?

1629,2017-10-12 10:21:18,17,19,"Let's say I'm developing a Java web application that is packaged into a war file. It uses Java 8.

When originally developing the application, I use the most current Java 8 JDK/JRE that is available, let's say it is 8u101. I use this version both for compiling the class files (JDK) and running the web application server (JRE).

Now then after some time, Oracle releases a new JDK/JRE version: 8u102. In order to be current, I upgrade to this new version on the application server (JRE). As I look over the release notes for the JDK/JRE, and especially the [table of issues fixed](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/2col/8u102-bugfixes-3021768.html), I notice that many of the fixed issues are related to the compiler.

This makes me suspect that if I also recompiled the project with the updated JDK, the outputted class files would differ in their bytecode from the original class files, as the internal operating logic of the javac compiler has changed (either through bug fixes or performance optimizations). So in this case, with the differences between Java 8u101 and Java 8u102, I would also need to recompile and redeploy the application in order to stay up-to-date.

But that is of course not always the case. A new JDK/JRE version with no changes to the compiler would generate binary-identical class files as the previous one, and no recompilation and redeploy would be needed, only an upgrade of the JRE on the application server.

So my question is, is there a build tool (Maven plugin or similar), that would compile your project with different JDK versions, and generated a report that would indicate those JDK versions that produce identical class files, and those JDK versions that do not? Then I could re-run the analysis after the release of each new JDK/JRE version and consult that report in order to determine whether a recompliation and redeploy of the application is needed or not.",Is there a (Maven) tool for finding out whether the compiled class files of a project are different across javac compiler versions?

If you’re using incubator modules and would like to ship them in the jars you distribute, is the best route to just compile them from OpenJDK’s source and bundle that? I use Maven if that matters. If there was a mirror on a Maven repo that I could use, that would be amazing. I feel like there has to be an easier way to do this without having to manually rebuild the library every time it updates.



Context: I made a project for personal learning to experiment with the Java 9 HttpClient incubator module, and ended up with something that a friend wants to use. I am continuing to use the HttpClient with the goal of learning how it should work, but I still want to be able to share this with people who don’t want to bother with the jdk.

So this is the 3rd iteration, and I am still working on it. But, I thought it was at a stage where I could give a little demo and not be too embarrassed. Open to feedback obviously.

Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=L2v-UApRYo8&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DquAWNJYlV44%26feature%3Dshare)

and here is the [git repo](https://github.com/laurencegw/jenjin) &lt;- Has some basic demos for various features in it.


Edit:

As requested, here is a bit more detail so you can decide if you want to actually spend the time watching an amateurish video or reading through lines of code.

 **Aims**

 * 2D only at this stage.
 * Slightly different from the excellently flexible and composable libGDX it is built on, Jenjin has an explicit architecture. It does have hooks for customization and plug-ability, but this can still be improved.
 * Reduce the general setup of a new game (Making screens, managing spritebatches, wiring inputs in, collision handling etc.)
 * Focus on the behavior of your objects and the rules of the game.

**Approach**

 * Declarative DSL for describing *SceneSpecs* which act like reusable and composable templates for creating 
 * Scene* instances.
 * Scenes are DAGs of Scene nodes for building up Scenes.
 * Scene Nodes are automatically pooled and reused. This does mean that pooling needs to be taken into account when defining your behavior components.
 * Physics is Box2D (obviously)
 *  DSL can describe Box2D lights, Sprites, Particles, shapes, animations and shaders (well, allows the plugging in of your GLSL shaders)
 * Behaviour is defined by pluggable and reusable components, and collisions are handled by pluggable reusable handlers.

**Very Simple Example**

This is all of the code that you need to write to do [this](https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=8S-fLv5gtsE&amp;feature=share):

    class BasicDemo : JJGame(
            JJConfig {

                gameView.cameraPosX = 0f
                gameView.cameraPosY = 0f
                gameView.clearColor = Color.BLUE
            }
    ) {
        override fun gameOn() {

I completely understand this and makes sense. However I am frustrated that the only way I can get around this is to either

1. Just accept it and leak the copy constructor and hope no one will bypass the factory method..
2. Make all fields private and do some ugly hacks
3. Just use a class and implement all the boilerplate like I would in java which isn't appealing at all as this is the whole point of using kotlin to avoid all of that.

It seems I am not the only one questioning answers to this. 

The author in this article goes into examples and the purposed solution of using the class is ugly and mentions you have to hand roll the copy method which is error prone.

If the goal is to write software that interacts with specific hardware, and therefore has to now details about said HW, the main advantages of a VM would be made pointless.

My main language is java, so the JVM is an always present part of my job. This was my starting point when thinking about this topic.

Let's hypothetically assume that the JVM actually fulfills it's main promises perfectly, mainly Platform independence.
Now the reason why people usually prefer a more powerful language like c++ to java is that the latter has a lower performance and doesn't offer fine grained control over the code (like absence of pointers). The main culprit often cited here is garbage collection, which allegedly stands in the way of the ingenuity of many c++ programmers (I'm sorry I couldn't help the slight dig here :&gt; )

Now with that being said, non of this issues are tied to the technological concept of a virtual machine. One could design a virtual machine with pointers and without garbage collection in theory. This would buy ""easy"" platform independence. Sure you would take a slight performance hit be adding a step in between but I very much doubt that this is bigger than all the black magic and goat sacrificing that is necessary to write c++ code that targets different platforms.

The question could extend to C as well, although given that it's mainly used for stuff that is very close to the hardware I understand why a VM isn't an option there.

It seems to me that in many applications the downsides of VMs would be acceptable given the benefits.

So why is there no GC++VM (GnuC++VirtualMachine) or something like that?

PS: I know that CVMs exist as experimental projects, my question is about why nobody uses them in production to get a platform independent C/C++


//edit: I just thought about that quite simply the different culture could be an answer to my question. However that seems to simplistic.",Why is there no widely used VM for C++?

1) I wanted to know if its better to learn vanilla JS for a month or two (once your solid in Html5, Css3) to understand under the hood how everything work before jumping into the latest frameworks or typescript or ES6 etc etc or you'll learn bad habits like old Jquery ways ?


2) I bought some books like Javascript definitive guide etc but it seem to be ES5 have a few others too like Eloquent and the you dont know series etc wasn't sure if it wasn't better to just learn the latest in tutorials online or go with books etc ?


3) is React the best frameworks to learn today once your solid in JS ? some ppl I talked too are saying Ember is solid and Angular 2 doesn't have much momentum compared Ang1 etc why is that ? is Vscode + extensions the best editors or its Atom ? Sublime ? How long does it take to learn Node ?

4) How fast is JS now compared the best of C# or JAVA or others ? been told it doesn't scale well and node is single threaded is that still true ? Why twitter switched to Java ?


I can study like 10-12 hrs a day if I want mostly nothing else to do so was wondering how long it could take to reach around junior frontend position etc

Many of you told me that I'm (and the corporations I've worked for) stuck in the past. I won't get into why sometimes we don't have a choice. Why we can't simply switch jobs for the same pay. And why we sometimes don't have a say on how large corporations with thousands of employees and hundreds of millions in profit are reluctant to change what isn't broken. So we'll leave that discussion for another day.

This post is about upgrading skills. I have to admit, I'm behind. I started using Java over 10 years ago &amp; haven't kept up with newer development. Work, family and kids got in the way.

So I'd like your suggestions on what new tech(in the Java world) I should learn. Please explain why your suggestion is important in today's world.

    var express = require('express');
    var app = express();
    app.get('/index1.jpg', new MjpegProxy('http://***:***@192.168.1.123:8080/stream/video/mjpeg').proxyRequest);
    app.listen(8080);

the *** are my username and password.  


When I run node restream.js  and navigate to http://localhost:8080  I get

1738,2017-11-27 03:41:15,0,1,"Bit of an odd request here. I have a system made up of many software components for which I'm writing a universal configuration utility. (This may seem odd, but it fulfills a system level requirement to have an 'automatic configuration' utility) The system is a mix of c++ and java components providing data processing/fusion for a customer hardware sensor. I am using a python java-props parser for the java components, and writing a custom parser for some others that use a white-spaced key/value format. At the top level I use a .ini file with pyconfig to change/set only the values that we care about setting. In other words, a file may have numerous properties already set (as defaults) but only a few, such as IP addresses, need to be changed at installation by the utility. Easy enough to solve, and it works well now.

The one that's giving me issue is a c++ component that uses libconfig, which is a hierarchical config format. I can't just replace key:items line by line in this format; a key/item pair might require an entire structure of parent tags to work correctly. So far I've been able to keep my config utility 'agnostic' to the nature of the software components; it is one-size-fits-all for the rest of the software component config file formats. Is there a good way that I can go from a flat representation in a .ini file (using pyconfig) to a fully formed libconfig format? There are python parsers for libconfig available, I'm just not sure how to bridge the two parsing formats.

In other words I want to somehow go from something like...

    [libconfigComponent]
    parent_struct:some_key=some_value
    parent_struct:another_key=another_value

to: (apologies if this isn't 100% correct libconfig style, I'm doing from bourbon-fuzzy memory)

    parent_struct = 
        {some_key= some_value;
          another_key=another_value}
    

and pass that to the python libconfig parser, which can insert/overwrite/modify the structure of the existing libconfig file. I just can't quite figure out how to meet in the middle. ",pyconfig (.ini) to libconfig ('flat format' to hierarchical config layout)

1749,2017-11-29 18:24:16,4,1,"I've been having a really hard time reading through my code if it has many functions with multiple type arguments with bounds and then one or more function parameters which sometimes use kotlin's functional types to make it worse.

For example, here's how it looks done traditional java style:

    internal fun &lt;T, A&gt; configurableStub(qproperty: GraphQlProperty, 
        enumClass: KClass&lt;T&gt;: EnumStub.ConfiguredQuery&lt;T, A&gt; 
        where T : QEnumType, T : Enum&lt;*&gt;, A : ArgBuilder {
      return EnumConfigStubImpl(qproperty, enumClass)
    }

After reformatting to the way I see most kotlin style guides it looks a little bit better:

    internal fun &lt;T, A&gt; configurableStub(
        qproperty: GraphQlProperty,
        enumClass: KClass&lt;T&gt;
    ): EnumStub.ConfiguredQuery&lt;T, A&gt;
        where T : QEnumType, T : Enum&lt;*&gt;, A : ArgBuilder =
        EnumConfigStubImpl(qproperty, enumClass)

However, it still looks messy when shown along with many other functions in my opinion. I tried the example below and to me it is far more readable:


    internal 
    fun &lt;T, A&gt; configuredStub(
        qproperty: GraphQlProperty,
        enumClass: KClass&lt;T&gt;)
      : 
      EnumStub.ConfiguredQuery&lt;T, A&gt;
        where T : QEnumType, T : Enum&lt;*&gt;, A : ArgBuilder
      = EnumConfigStubImpl(qproperty, enumClass)

Ideally I want to be able to program software and I'd like to be able to use websites like Freelancer to get some side income on projects while I'm finishing my degree. Like I said, I have no idea where to go from where I am. If someone today asked me to make a program that would be able to do *something*, I could probably write the code but I wouldn't know how to make the GUI or anything. I was just wondering what people would recommend for me to do now that I have the basic understanding of the language.

## Intro

If you are not familiar with Zircon yet, you can

- read the [previous release notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/73ozl4/zircon_a_text_gui_library_version_201720_released/)
- read the [README](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/README.md) which also contains some screenshots

---
## New Features

We've been busy working on some new stuff for Zircon like:
  

### The `GameComponent`

In this release we introduce the new [`GameComponent`](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/org/codetome/zircon/api/component/GameComponent.kt) which solves issue [#42](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/42).
Its purpose is to provide a `Component` which you can add to your UI and with which you can display your game area
in an easy to use way. It comes with its own [`Builder`](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/org/codetome/zircon/api/component/builder/GameComponentBuilder.kt), **scrolling** and some additional classes:

- [`GameArea`](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/org/codetome/zircon/api/game/GameArea.kt) is intended to be an
adapter between your game and the Zircon GUI with methods for getting and setting `TextCharacters` and groups of `TextCharacters` on the screen. A `GameArea`
is basically a 3D cube representing the whole game field.
 You can implement your own `GameArea` if you like or use the built-in [`TextImageGameArea`](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/org/codetome/zircon/internal/game/TextImageGameArea.kt) which is good for trying things out.
- [`GameAreaSegment`](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/org/codetome/zircon/api/game/GameAreaSegment.kt) represents a single
level (Z-layer) of a `GameArea`.
- With [`ProjectionMode`](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/org/codetome/zircon/api/game/ProjectionMode.kt) you can decide
between using a `TOP_DOWN` (like in Dwarf Fortress) or an `ISOMETRIC` view. [Here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/388833462402154497/GIF.gif) is an example of how `TOP_DOWN` looks like and [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/391379033612353546/isometric.gif) is an example for the `ISOMETRIC` view.


#### Some more info

- Each layer of a `GameComponent` is layered. This way you can have multiple `TextCharacter`s over each other in the same 3D position.
  This works in a way like you can expect from a `Layerable`.
- In `ISOMETRIC` mode you can expect objects which are further from the user's viewpoint to be overlapped properly with objects
  which are closer to the user
- The `GameComponent` is still in *Beta* so we'd like to **hear about your opinions and ideas** about it. We'd like to figure out a way
  which makes this easy-to-use for you
  

### Multi-font support

That's right! After solving [#31](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/31) you are finally able to use multiple fonts
in the same `Terminal`, `Screen`, `Layer` or `Component`! Currently you can only use `Font`s which have the same size but you
can mix and match *CP437* and *Graphic* tilesets. In a later version we'll add support for mixing in *half-width* `Font`s as well!
[This](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/277739394641690625/367091561508503552/GIF.gif) is an example of multi-font support
in action.


### TextCharacterString support 

`TextCharacterString`s are an aggregation of `TextCharacter`s into an array. You can draw a `TextCharacterString` onto any `DrawSurface` and you can expect it to behave in a way like handwriting would (if a string does not fit in a line it continues in a new line).

Text wrapping is managed by `TextWrap` which is an `enum` with `NO_WRAPPING` and `WRAP`  options.

`TextCharacterString` comes with its own builder and you can create them in a simple way from plain Java `String`s.

---
## Enhancements

We've also worked on some nuisances which were present:
  

### Usability enhancements

[#44](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/44) solves an usability issue which arises if you try to put a non-printable character on the screen.
**Great thanks** to [Coldwarrl](https://github.com/coldwarrl) for submitting a PR for this.

With [#39](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/39) we added `putCharacter` to the `Screen` as well and also an overload
variant which takes `TextCharacter`s.

With [#43](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/43) done font caching is now optional. You can turn it off when creating your `Terminal`
with a `TerminalBuilder`.


### Internal changes

Solving [#37](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/37) laid the groundwork for writing truly platform-independent
`Font` handling.

This is important for encapsulating the draw logic without hard-coding GUI technology-specific details. So `BufferedImage` will became `FontTextureRegion` which will have methods which will have different implementations depending on the underlying GUI tech (`BufferedImage` in Java2D and `TextureRegion` in libGDX for example). Currently it just delegates to the proper backend.

---
## Bug fixes

These are the known bugs which were solved:

### [#45](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/45) fixed
&gt; Setting the `TRANSPARENT` background for `TextImage` does not work

### [#52](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/52) fixed
&gt; `TextBox`: `setText` does not refresh the draw surface

### [#41](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/41) fixed
&gt; Wrong symbol/glyph is displayed

This was a **tough one**. It was caused by a `hashCode` collision. Shoutout to [Coldwarrl](https://github.com/coldwarrl) for helping to solve this!

### [#40](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/40) fixed
&gt; Bug in `TextCharacterString`

---
## Miscellaneous

- [Coldwarrl](https://github.com/coldwarrl) officially became a contributor to the project
- We also have a new logo for the [Hexworks organization](https://github.com/Hexworks)
- [Geldrin](https://geldrin.deviantart.com/) created a T-shirt with a Zircon banner, you can check it out [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/205245036084985857/394162831559360513/DSC_0299.JPG). PM me if you want to buy one. :)

---
## Roadmap

We've laid out the direction for the project so here are the milestones we'd like to reach for the next release:

- Proper `FontTextureRegion` abstraction for different backends. This is a must if we want to have multiple GUI backends
  (Swing, JavaFX and libGDX in the first version).
- Proper modularization depending on GUI backend
  Zircon will be split into multiple modules: `zircon.core`, `zircon.swing`, `zircon.javafx` and `zircon.libgdx` for start.
  Since from `1.2` Kotlin supports multiplatform projects this will be rather easy to do so and in the end you'll only have
  to include the version you need in your own project.
- We'll also need to add *libGDX* and *JavaFX* support to the respective modules
- Component wrapping is right now a mess, but we need to fix this. It is not explicit currently but when you call `wrapInBox`
  or `addShadow` with any `Component` you use a wrapper. This will be made explicit in the future and you'll be able to
  add your own wrappers.
- *funKtion* integration: by integrating [funKtion](https://github.com/Hexworks/funktion) we'll be able to take advantage
  of the persistent data structures it brings to the table which will help us get rid of the blocking we have now and it
  will also help us write performant immutable objects (like `TextCharacter` or `StyleSet`) as well.

Working in an enterprise environment we have a cluster of web proxies all our internet traffic has to go through or the firewall will block the request.

Chrome, Firefox etc will automatically respond to this by passing the proxy your windows credentials.

1880,2018-01-28 13:03:15,9,1,"I wanted to start writing ES6 for a web application with a Node/Express backend. My devDependencies are Babel-CLI, Babel-Core, and Babel-Preset-Env.

Currently, my folder structure is as follows:

    src/
        index.js (server-side JavaScript)
        public/ (client-side stuff)
            javacript,js

    dist/
        index.js (server-side JavaScript)
        public/ (client-side stuff)
            javacript,js
            index.html
            style.css

My scripts are:

`""build"": ""babel src -d dist""` (Babel takes the JavaScript from src/, transpiles it, and outputs it in its respective location in dist/.)

`""start"": ""node dist/index.js""` (I then run the web application with the transpiled dist/index.js, which serves up public/index.html to the webpage with Express (res.send), and that file fetches its JavaScript and styling from &lt;script&gt; tags.)

My worry is that I'm doing this completely wrong.

All of the guides/GitHub projects I've seen don't rely on dist/. Their dist/ is omitted with .gitignore, and all of their files are in src/. 

For example: my dist/public/index.html and dist/public/style.css should be in src/public/index.html and src/public/style.css respectively. But then they're using the non-transpiled .js files in src/.

Then, where do I output the transpiled .js files, if not in dist/? The non-transpiled are already in src/, so I can't put them there.

1901,2018-02-06 17:41:59,21,9,"Here's a question for /r/java. How many of you guys are using SONAR to guide your testing agenda? We actually have set thresholds in our CI environment to fail builds if line and branch coverage fall below certain thresholds. Have such efforts effected (or damaged) how you write code?

For example, we are getting `ResultSet` objects mapped into  `Object[]` arrays, which we then map into DTOs. Obviously, it would be better to skip the `Object[]` step and just go straight to DTOs. But for the sake of argument...

Consider the following code:

    Option[] results = ...
    ResultDTO dto = new ResultDTO();
    dto.setSomeOptionalID(results[0] == null ? null : ((Number) results[0]).longValue());

SONAR will penalize you on branch coverage if you don't have a test for the null case and the non-null case.

I was considering replacing that with the following:

    Option[] results = ...
    ResultDTO dto = new ResultDTO();
    Optional.ofNullable((Number) results[0]).map(Number::longValue).ifPresent(dto::setSomeOptionalID);

In this case, I can have a single test case for the non-null case, and SONAR won't penalize me on branch coverage.

On one hand, this illustrates the benefits of functional programming. It adds safety by reducing the number of branches.

On the other hand, this could be considered misusing `Optional`, introducing unnecessary objects, and damaging the design of Java code in the pursuit of better branch coverage numbers.

        &lt;/dependency&gt;

and an AWS account that has a Kinesis stream named `some-kinesis-stream`.

Here's the code:

    import com.amazonaws.auth.DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain
    import com.amazonaws.services.kinesis.AmazonKinesis
    import com.amazonaws.services.kinesis.AmazonKinesisClientBuilder
    import com.amazonaws.services.kinesis.model.GetRecordsRequest

    import com.amazonaws.services.kinesis.model.ShardIteratorType

    fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) {

        var result = amazonKinesis.describeStream(streamName)

        shards.addAll(result.streamDescription.shards.map { it.shardId })

            result = amazonKinesis.describeStream(streamName, result.streamDescription.shards.last().shardId)
            shards.addAll(result.streamDescription.shards.map { it.shardId })
        }

        return shards
    }

There are four things I don't like about the shards function:

1. I prefer an approach that doesn't need explicitly declaring `shards`
2. `result` is mutable
3. `result.streamDescription.shards.map { it.shardId }` is duplicated
4. I prefer an approach that only uses collection functions (e.g. `map`, etc.) and doesn't need a `while` loop

I can fix item `3` a bit:

	fun shards2(amazonKinesis: AmazonKinesis, streamName: String): List&lt;String&gt; {
	    val shards = ArrayList&lt;Shard&gt;()
	    var result = amazonKinesis.describeStream(streamName)

	    shards.addAll(result.streamDescription.shards)
	    while (result.streamDescription.hasMoreShards) {
	        result = amazonKinesis.describeStream(streamName, result.streamDescription.shards.last().shardId)
	        shards.addAll(result.streamDescription.shards)
	    }

	    return shards.map { it.shardId }
	}

However now `shards.addAll(result.streamDescription.shards)` is duplicated.

On git, I push my source files and the requirements.txt, not the virtualenv files. Now this is the part Im unsure is ""correct"" or standard procedure.

Now, the HUGE problem i have.  We run Winblows.  

To create a venv (using python 3.6's internal venv tools) it takes installing 6 gigs of visual c++ compiler, and a huge amount of fiddling with libraries, compilations, etc to get a single venv going.  Trying to use wheels doesnt' help because there are wheels missing and such.

Plus there's the problem that if everything goes perfectly, it takes about 15-20 minutes to create a venv.  And if the dev happens to run a clean on their build, there's another 15 - 20 minutes.

So, the question is, is it possible to package and redistribute a venv?

Now, zipping a master copy, distributing it, unzipping where and when needed, thats easy.  But what im talking about is if i do this, is there anything that would prevent say one java project with 4 subprojects, each subproject has a venv loaded.

Since this is a corp environment, all winblows machines are more or less identical.  all win7 machines, migrating to win10 this year.  i realize i would probably have to account for the two different operating systems seeing the windows SDK is needed to do most compiles.

has anyone tried this?",Is it possible to build a distributable venv?

I followed numerous tutorials online to integrate CORS into RESTlet, verify I'm preventing default on my AJAX/XHR request, and have valid data since I can access the URL if I copy and paste it from the Firefox inspector panel.

https://github.com/f00dl3/asWeb

I posted most of the code here. I also included a ""vanillaXhr.js"" file which experiences the same issue using the ""vanilla"" way - so it's not Dojo's fault.

For what it's worth, here's jQuery that fails at this too:

    var shortBaseForRestlet = ""/asWeb/r"";
    var fullBaseForRestlet = self.location.protocol + ""//"" + self.location.host + shortBaseForRestlet;
    var baseForRestlet = fullBaseForRestlet; 

    $(document).ready(function() {
    $.ajax({
        url: baseForRestlet+""/WebVersion"",
        dataType: 'json',
        type : 'GET',
        success: function(data){

            console.log(jqXHR.status);

    });

        corsService.setAllowedCredentials(true);
        corsService.setSkippingResourceForCorsOptions(true);
        getServices().add(corsService);

Of interest is I have suspicions that Firefox is blocking it, so I set the ""security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy;false"" as well. I never see the requests hit my webserver in /var/log/tomcat8/catalina.log

Here's what I ended up doing, is this the best way to do it (overloading)?

    fun newIntent(context: Context, a: String, title: Int?, b: String? = null) = 
       newIntent(context, a, title?.let { context.getString(title) } ?: """", b)

            b?.let { putExtra(B, b) }

(real factory has about 6 optional parameters, I simplified it for the example)

This was my 3rd attempt, 1st I tried with both titles being optional which of course results in an ambiguous method call when you leave title null, then I went down the single factory with Any? with a ""when"" path which just felt wrong from the start, finally ended up with this Int? or String overload.  

Edit: In Java to accomplish this I had used a builder pattern that implemented two mutually exclusive interfaces -
 once you called setTitle the return value was one interface or the other so you could only call either .setTitle(int) or .setTitle(String).",Optional Param that can be two types (String or ResId)?

The majority of our customers hardware aka probably all of our customers hardware do not have direct access to the internet, so I would have to figure out some way to get creative if we went that direction.

The files contained inside the zip are shown in this screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/IOhnL


So I’m confused as to what I’m supposed to do from here? 

How do I embed the tour that I created on Marzipano to the website of a restaurant or real estate agency? 
What am I supposed to do with these java script and CSS files? 

Thanks

2) It showed JRE 1.8 installed in C:\Program Files \ Java \ jre 1.8.0.2_5

3) I click on search and select  C:\Program Files \ Java \  ; this folder contains JDK 10 and JRE 10. But when search concludes it ends up picking up the JDK 1.8 that is also installed in the same directory but not JDK 10.

4) I try to manually add the JRE/ JDK by clicking Add and then it gives me a window titled Add JRE followed by JRE Definition. When I point the JRE home to C:\Program Files \ Java \ jdk-10.0.1 it gives an error ""Target is not a JDK root. System Library was not found"" . I point it to bin and same result.


When I run the cmd prompt and type java -version it gives me the correct version (10) because I have set PATH to point to JDK 10. (for some reason the path has these odd C:\Program Files\ Oracle \ Java variables which is incorrect ).

2059,2018-05-01 20:13:49,15,32,"If you use [SLF4J](https://slf4j.org) (and possibly Logback) for logging, you are probably familiar with the following code:

```
val logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass::class.java)
```

## The kotlin way
We like short code, and we like DRY.
So here are 3 other ways of getting a logger, to avoid repeating the tedious `LoggerFactory` stuff:

### 1. Factory function

- Function definition is easy to understand, but usage requires the class name.
- Gives the correct logger class name in companions.

**Code**:

    inline fun &lt;reified T&gt; logger(): Logger {
        return LoggerFactory.getLogger(T::class.java)
    }


**Usage**:

    class LogWithFactoryFunction {
        val logger = logger&lt;LogWithFactoryFunction&gt;()
    
        fun doSomething() {
            logger.info(""Hey from a delegate!"")
        }
    }
    
    class LogWithCompanionFactoryFunction {
        companion object {
            val logger = logger&lt;LogWithFactoryFunction&gt;()
        }
    
        fun doSomething() {
            logger.info(""Hey from a delegate!"")
        }
    }

---

### 2. Companion with inheritance

- No visible `logger` property in your code; it's available through the companion object
- Logger gets `$Companion` in the logger name
- Interface version asks for a logger each time, causing slf4j to check it's initialization state

**Code**: 

    abstract class Log {
        val logger: Logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this.javaClass)
    }

or

    interface Log {
        fun log() = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this.javaClass)
    }

**Usage**:

    class LogWithCompanion {
        companion object : Log() {}
    
        fun doSomething() {
            logger.info(""Hey from a companion!"")
        }
    }

or

    class LogWithInterfaceCompanion {
        companion object : ILog {}
    
        fun doSomething() {
            log().info(""Hey from a companion!"")
        }
    }

---

### 3. Delegate property

- Harder to understand delegate source code
- Logger gets `$Companion` in the logger name if placed in a companion


**Code**:

    class LoggerDelegate : ReadOnlyProperty&lt;Any?, Logger&gt; {
    
        companion object {
            private fun &lt;T&gt;createLogger(clazz: Class&lt;T&gt;) : Logger {
                return LoggerFactory.getLogger(clazz)
            }
        }
    
        private var logger: Logger? = null
    
        override operator fun getValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty&lt;*&gt;): Logger {
            if (logger == null) {
                logger = createLogger(thisRef!!.javaClass)
            }
            return logger!!
        }
    }

**Usage**:

    class LogWithDelegate {
        val logger by LoggerDelegate()
    
        fun doSomething() {
            logger.info(""Hey from a delegate!"")
        }
    }

## Opinions?

Do you have a different way of doing it?  
Which version do you prefer, and why?

Thanks for reading.
Hope you learned a cool new way of creating loggers! :)

I've been a java developer for over ten years during which time nearly everything we used to do in Java has had an equivalent created in JS and \(thankfully\) has made things a lot better on the web and elsewhere. The focus has been in the frontend, but I've also seen the rise of Node and JS being used for backend stuff more and more. I myself am an entirely backend engineer \(Java\) nowadays.

At any rate, I always try to keep my skills current and this year I want to learn how the JS community/ecosystem might be achieving what I do in Java on the backend these days...I have used Express.js in the past \(few years back\) and am wondering, if Express.js is still the major framework for building RESTful API's on Node or if I should be looking at learning something else?

Thanks!",Backend JS in 2018?
2066,2018-05-03 17:32:46,2,1,"please help me I need this code before this Friday. post only the complete code, please. All classes should be serializable and comparable. The driver is also required for this. The programming language is Java.

If necessary, you can post only the driver class for this project.

Implementing GUI and sorting methods to this is optional, but greatly appreciated.

Problem: you are to create an app for a library. A Library has different members such as students. Members should be able to search for a book by different criteria such as title, author, and subject. As soon as the book is found in the library, then the student will check out the book and this book will be added to the list of the books that the student has borrowed. When a student returns a book, then that book must be remove from his/her list. The information about items and students must be read from files.

Your program must have the input validation such that no user can enter wrong data. Use exception handling whenever possible. In the client class you must use methods. Everything needs to be done through a method call. You are free to add any functionality to your program and any creativity will be appreciated. Your program must read the data from a file. You need three different files for books, students and administrators.

.

Steps to complete your project:

1. There are 6 different classes and you need to implement all these classes and make sure that they work properly by writing client class. You must read the information for the students and books from files to populate the ArrayList for the class students and books.

2. In the main method you must provide the following functionalities Students should be able to do :

o Search by author //must write a method

o Search by subject//must write a method

o Search by topic//must write a method

o Search by keyword//must write a method

o After the item is selected, the item must be added to the student list of

checked out items if the item is available.

Admin people should be able to do the following.

o Search for items o Addanewitem o Delete a new item o Add a student

o Remove a student

o Search for a student

When implementing the client class, you must use many different methods. Everything must be done through a method call. For example for searching a student in the array you must write a method. Codes without any methods will receive no credit.

Before logging out the application all the updated data must be stored in a file. When you run your program all the data must be loaded from the file back to the lists that you are suppose to create for your program.

Description:

In this project you are going to develop a library application. Using this application students will be able to search for books, video CD, journals, and audio CD. Administrators will use this app to add or remove resources from the database in the library. Therefore the main page should have to different options

o Students \(id number is required\). If student is not found in the list of the students then n error message should be displayed

o Administrators \(id number is required\). If the id is not found an error message must be displayed

Students

Students should be able to search the data base using different search criteria such as:

 Title

 Subject

 Keywords in the subject

 Keywords in the title

Once the search criteria is declared by the user, then the list of all the available resources must appear on the screen. Once the user selects the desired item, then the status for the item must be changed to check out and the item must be added to the student account. A return date must be specified for the user. When a book is returned by a student, first your app must make sure that the book has been returned on time otherwise a penalty will be added to the user account. If the total penalty is more than 50 dollars on a student account, then a hold will be put on the user account and the student will no longer be able to check out any books.

All the information for the students and resources must be stored in a file therefore every time you log out the system all the info must be saved to a file. As soon as you log in all the info must be read from files and stored in appropriate collections. You must make all your classes serializable

Administrators: Administrators should be able

 To add or remove items to/from the database

 Add or remove students

 Put a hold on a student account

 Search through the students and send a notification to the students who have pass

2089,2018-05-12 14:13:59,35,74,"So I have a VS 2017 codebase that I maintain with some really poor beginner-level source control on github. It's 25,000 lines of code in total, and for my use case I need to generate two separate, nearly identical binaries each time I build—with the only difference in one of the binaries being the addition of 10 extra lines of code.

I need two binaries because one is intended to be run and used directly in .exe form, while the other is intended to be run as an .exe indirectly through a rigidly constructed java binary which I have no control over. The 10 extra lines needed to make it compatible with the java binary also render the bare .exe file unusuable directly.

Is there an easy way in Visual Studio 2017 for me to compile two minimally-differing binaries from the same codebase at once?

Or perhaps there is another workaround which can only activate those 10 extra lines of code when it someone detects that it's interfacing with that java binary?

Thanks, I'm bad at programming but I appreciate your help.","I have a VS 2017 git codebase that's 25,000 lines long.

2090,2018-05-12 19:53:56,3,9,"Hey,

I'm writing to start a small app for the first time in Kotlin. I'm also using Room for the database.

Now I tried to play around with extensions and delegations, and I got tired of writing

    // v1
    val db: AppDatabase by lazy { Room.databaseBuilder(applicationContext, AppDatabase::class.java, ""production"").build() }

everytime.

So I first wrote an extension function like this:

    // v2
    fun Activity.getDatabase(): AppDatabase {
        return Room.databaseBuilder(applicationContext, AppDatabase::class.java, ""production"").build()
    }

    // in the Activity:
    val db by lazy { getDatabase() }

or made it into a property

    //v3
    inline val Activity.appDatabase: AppDatabase get() 
       = Room.databaseBuilder(applicationContext, AppDatabase::class.java, ""production"").build()

    // in the Activity:
    val db by lazy { appDatabase }

respectively. Everything of these worked fine.

 
---


Then I tried the delegation class

    // v4
    class RoomDbAccess(private val activity: Activity) {
        operator fun getValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty&lt;*&gt;): AppDatabase
                = Room.databaseBuilder(activity.applicationContext, AppDatabase::class.java, ""production"").build()
    }

    // in the Activity:
    val db by RoomDbAccess(this)

which also worked quite nicely.

Now the funny thing is: When I added a generic parameter &lt;T&gt; to the class, I suddenly get a warning:

&gt;**do not place android context classes in static fields; this is a memory leak**

So is this only a problem for the delegation class?

**Are any of the other snippets bad practice (for Kotlin and/or Android)?**

Thanks for any insight! I'm really enjoying Kotlin so far.",Question about Delegation in Android with Room

I apologize if this is in the wrong subreddit.  I have minimal experience with programming and coding.  Here’s my question:

My dad uses Java to code software, and I believe he uses a build tool called Apache Ant. I don’t know much about it, but from the looks of google it is ancient by now.  I recently upgraded his computer to improve build times, but it didn’t have the effect I had hoped. I suspect this is because Ant relies solely on single thread performance.  My question is, are there any alternatives to Ant that are perhaps more modern, and importantly, could reduce the java build times?  Thanks in advance.

This guide is the answer to some popular Frequently Asked Questions by newcomers before entering into the world of programming. This article will provide you a detailed analysis of the most debatable topic – how to start learning to programming. Following question and answer will help you to clear some of your confusion on how to start learning to programming.

**Which Language is best to start learning Programming?**

To this question, there will be diverse opinions by the expert, but most importantly you have to keep in mind that no programming language is easy to start with. This is because to start learning to programme involves learning the concepts first (i.e how a program interacts with a system), then programming language parameter’s (to write programs), write programs to solve some problems, then delve into its advance aspect’s and get into solving some real-world problem’s.

**C or C++ or Java **are considered best to start with. Just pick anyone and start learning, after you have grasped the concept’s and are able to do some standard programs then you can extend your knowledge to other languages. Believe me after you start with any of these programming languages at some of the time in future after spending a considerable time with that language you’ll fee that that you still have to learn a lot, as there infinite possibilities what you can do with these, maybe create a new language of your own or create a whole new operating system, possibilities are endless.

Now, if you are wondering out of the three which one to pick and start learning programming then here is the solution:

C Programming Language created by Denis Ritchie was the first to be popularized. Most of the operating system like windows, Linux, Mac OS, and others owe their origin to this language. Many popular and free/commercial software’s like Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, Auto desk products, Video/audio production software etc...

Then came C++ (by Bjarne Stroustrup) which is an only advance form of C language.

Java by James Gosling is also one of the most popular because it also finds it’s usage in numerous of the devices, software and web applications.

**Which Programming Language Should I start with?**

Now, that’s purely personal choice, really! For instance, I started with C language learning it myself, then in my school, C++ was taught and I could make the easy transition from C to C++ in the same time preserving the C knowledge. Now, I had been learning Java for some months now.

How to actually decide which one to start with depends on what you want to achieve with the language.

If you want to develop programs for Windows/Linux/Mac platform C/C++ should be your starting point, though for Mac programming requires knowledge of C – Objective, but learning that can be made easy with some standard knowledge in C/C++.

Now, you decide yourself which one to start with.

**I’m Confusing With C or C++, Which to start with?**

If you are in any engineering stream then I’d recommend to go with C, then go to C++. If you are not into any engineering then you can always start with C++.

**Where To Learn and What Are The Proper Methods?**

If you really do not want to join any coaching or institutes for that purpose then you need not worry because you can always start learning programming yourself (i.e you’ll be self-taught).

What you’ll need first is a good book or online tutorials which cover’s most concepts with nice and adequate examples and has decent workable exercise’s.

# [read-multi-stream](https://github.com/roger-dv/read-multi-stream)

## Introduction

A C++11 prototype application exploring the use of the Linux `select()` system call and `read()` system call, invoked in a non-blocking manner, to process multiple input file streams concurrently.

## Description of program project

The source code is C++11 compliant and has been compiled and successfully executed where used the GNU C++ (g++) 4.8.4 compiler. The program was developed in the JetBrains CLion C++ IDE and is therefore a cmake-based project.

## Description of program operation

The program will process one or more file paths as specified on its command line when invoked. It assumes that each file will be a text file compressed using gzip and thus the file names are expected to end in the `'.gz'` suffix. The program will, for each file, perform a `fork()` system call and then `exec` the `gzip` program (which is assumed can be locatable via the `PATH` environment variable), it will setup redirection of a `gzip` child process `stdout` and `stderr` so that these pipe streams can be processed as input streams by the program's parent process.

The C++ class `read_multi_stream` is used to manage the redirected streams of each forked child process. The method `read_multi_stream::wait_for_io()` is used to wait for i/o activity on these redirected pipes. It will return with a vector populated with any pipe file descriptors that are ready to be read. The program dispatches these active file descriptors to be read via an asynchronously invoked read processing function and then waits on futures of all dispatched file descriptors. When all futures are harvested, then it iterates and calls `read_multi_stream::wait_for_io()` again, repeating the cycle until all pipes have been read to end-of-file condition (or errored out).

The output of the pipes, assumed to be text streams, will be read a text line at a time. The program will write the output of a redirected `stdout` to a file by the same name as the input file, but omitting the `'.gz'` suffix. The redirected `stderr` is written to a file by the same name as this output file but with the suffix `'.err'` appended - any diagnostic output or errors occurring per the processing of a given input file will be written to its corresponding `'.err'` file.

The operation to process a given text line is dealt with as a lambda callable; the current implementation merely writes the text line to the destination output file, however, this lambda callable is where application logic processing could be performed (if any) on each text line at a time.

The C++11 `std::async()` function is used to asychronously process each ready-to-read file descriptor, where the `std::launch::async` option is used to insure is processed on some thread.

GNU g++ 4.8.4 appears to map asychronous invocation directly to pthread library threads. The C++11 standard did not dictate an implementation approach for `std::async()` so it is conceivable that an implementor might utilize a sophisticated thread pool incorporating work stealing algorithms, etc. Future versions of C++ - probably starting at C++20 - will perhaps introduce exectutors and thread pools with richer APIs.

The GNU g++ 4.8.4 implementation of `std::async(std::launch::async, ...)` does exhibit interleaved, round robin concurrency behavior, though, when this program is fed lots of input files to process.

Keep in mind, the nature of the way this program works was devised so as to test out and explore programming with the `select()` system call, in conjunction to non-blocking invocation of the `read()` system call, in conjunction to C++11 asynchronous and concurrency (futures) capabilities. It is not intended as necessarily the ideal means to mass gzip decompress large numbers of files, none-the-less, it's execution at doing so is rather brisk.

**NOTE:** *The program does tend to write a lot of debug messages (it's an experimental prototype - not production code) so is a good idea to redirect its `stderr` output to a file, or even to `2&gt;/dev/null` in order to see the program execute a closer to optimal speed.*

## The bigger picture

The greater intent of this exploration is to devise a particular reactive programming implementation that will be infused into another github project:

[**Spartan - a ""forking"" java program launcher**](https://github.com/tideworks/spartan-launcher)

**Spartan brief description:**

*Java supervisor process can launch Java child worker processes (uses Linux fork and then instantiates JVM). Child programs run as same user identity/permissions capability - no authentication or special permissioning necessary. A Spartan-launched Java program thus shares the same Java code amongst parent supervisor and children processes - just as with using `fork()` in C and C++ programming.*",read-multi-stream - C++ reactive prototype application exploring the use of Linux select() and non-block read() to process multiple input file streams

I'm a PM in a software company. I don't know the code much, but I'm working in a team of 3 developers and I wonder about one specific estimate.

We have a unit test written in java for a new feature. This is a new code a single developer has been working on for last 6 months. She wrote the code and now she's updating existing unit test with new methods to test the new functionality. This test method calls the code, that somewhere down deep reads data from DB. So we need to mock some backend static method (in java class) to return predefined constant list instead of reading data from DB. We already have a framework called powermock in place. We also have couple of other test cases written, that are using powermock to mock static methods. And as I said, this is new feature written by the same dev that is now working on this testing method.

My question is, how would you realistically estimate the work to be done here. We are talking about mocking only, I'm not asking about the whole test method. I know that it depends on many factors, but I'm curios about rought estimates. She has been working on this mock for 3 days and she think it can take another week. Is this what you think is realistic? Do you think it's quick? Or it is too much?

2157,2018-06-11 21:45:07,0,27,"Today I decided to try Kotlin's Script Engine on my production app, after all, Nashorn was getting kinda boring and Kotlin 💖, so I decided to try it.

Created a small ""test class"" on my project, ran it within IntelliJ IDEA, no errors! Now let's try running it on my production server... huh? `unresolved reference`? but... why? heck, if that class didn't exist you wouldn't even be able to be called at all!

	javax.script.ScriptException: error: unresolved reference: mrpowergamerbr
	fun loritta(context: com.mrpowergamerbr.loritta.commands.CommandContext) {
							 ^

Yeah, for some reason Kotlin Script Engine can't find my classes, or anything at all actually, but... why? They surely exist in runtime because, if they didn't, the app wouldn't even run!

Then after thinking and searching at Google, I stumbled upon this [YouTrack issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-21443) however it was related to fat JARs, and my production app wasn't using a fat JAR, but I decided to investigate...

And after countless tries, I finally got it working! But why it wasn't working... well...

Today I decided to stop building fat JARs, before my JAR was a [good boye](https://i.redd.it/b8mwhr9p1l8z.jpg), weighting only ~10MBs... but because my app was growing with more features, the JAR kept growing due to new dependencies and new code being added... then the JAR was ~70MBs and the good boye wasn't a good boye anymore, it was a [fatty boye](https://i.imgur.com/UaEscmK.jpg)

So I decided to scrap it, stopping building the fat JAR shaved off 10s from my build time (and shaved ~20s seconds when copying the JAR to production, instead now I copy only the libraries when I need it to update it!), made every dependency be exported to a  `libs/` folder and made Maven add the `Class-Path` to the `MANIFEST.MF` and everything worked great! ...except Kotlin's Script Engine.

The reason it doesn't work is because, for some reason, Kotlin's Script Engine wasn't even getting my own classes from the JAR! But wait, there is a fix.

You can add all your libraries manually via the `-Dkotlin.script.classpath=jar1:jar2:jar3:jar4` on your startup script... buuuut that's too boring and you will need to update it on every library update/added/remove... so let's rely on code!

	val path = this::class.java.protectionDomain.codeSource.location.path
	val jar = JarFile(path)
	val mf = jar.manifest
	val mattr = mf.mainAttributes
	// Yes, you SHOULD USE Attributes.Name.CLASS_PATH! Don't try using ""Class-Path"", it won't work!
	val manifestClassPath = mattr[Attributes.Name.CLASS_PATH] as String

	// The format within the Class-Path attribute is different than the one expected by the property, so let's fix it!
	// By the way, don't forget to append your original JAR at the end of the string!
	val propClassPath = manifestClassPath.replace("" "", "":"") + "":Loritta-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar""

	// Now we set it to our own classpath
	System.setProperty(""kotlin.script.classpath"", propClassPath)

And after that, you can evaluate your code (even if it relies on external classes) without any issues! Yay!

	javaScript = ""fun test() { println(\""Hello World\!\"") }""

	val engine = ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName(""kotlin"")
	engine.eval(javaScript)
	val invocable = engine as Invocable
	invocable.invokeFunction(""test"")

There was a lot of advice on how C++ is hard and  how anyone should keep away from C++ because it was 2016.I did some research and found Qt would be a good solution to the problem . 2 years later the program has been shipped with many happy customers. 

One of the major points they raised was that memory management is hard. Really ? std::unique_ptr  and std::shared_ptr are great inventions . You dont need to unnecesarily declare new variables just to pass them around functions . C++ isnt as hard as people put it out to be. It does have a ""simple mode"" where you can almost get away by not using templates in your project. My advice to those willing to learn it is to have a project they are willing to see through from start to finish. You will pick up most things as you build your project. Online tutorials get a bit stale after you are passed through the basics i.e loops , types and variables. 

 C++ does have a good advantage of having a lot of the most useful libraries you might need being open source . All you need is a compiler and you are ready to go .  Lots of them are well tested , documented and don't try hard to do multiple things at once.There are no fads when it comes to useful libraries  , they are designed to last. The pros of building desktop apps with C++ far outweigh the cons.

I've been trying javax.usb (usb4java implementation) to solve a use case I have but can't seem to find a solution.

I need to connect 2 usb keyboards to a computer, but the second keyboard must not be listened by the OS (Windows in my case) for typing. Instead, all the input events of that second keyboard must be read exclusively by the app.

In the app I would enumerate the USB devices and the user would choose the keyboard to be assigned to the app.

I've been able to enumerate and identify the devices using javax.usb and claim the device but I am unable to read data input from the keyboard. Also the keyboard is still read by the OS - did I get the meaning of 'claim' right?

Thought of arduino/raspberry/phidgets and some sort of client/server layout, but if I could do it with only one PC that would be ideal.

Is there any way to achieve what I need?

We have tried Gradle on some of our projects, and there are things about it that I really like, but it hasn't been a panacea. Tooling, ecosystem, and migration of the build scripts between versions have been pain points with it.

So I recently undertook a quick study of build tools that are out there, to maybe begin another wave of ""can I please get rid of Maven"" at my company.

I've got my eyes on Bezel at the moment, but also found Buck. And whatever happened to sbt? I don't see much talk about it anymore. I understand that ecosystem is going to be a problem with the newer tools, but that could be surmountable if there are other benefits.

I'm curious what the pulse of /r/java is on Java build tools. This is for my work, so we do CI (farms - master/slaves), multiple concurrent builds (integrated with code review tools), parameterized builds, unit and integration tests, VM/container infrastructure building/testing, RPM and other kinds of packaging - pretty much the gamut.

Especially comparing to Java's excessively verbose syntax for doing simple stuff, I find C++'s quite easy to follow. (although File IO sometimes f**ks up)

All Posts on Quora, reddit, stackoverflow never seem to address which part of the syntax is difficult. They mention that c++ creator said it was difficult, so its difficult. :/

Most posts mention that STL is quite large and on the other hand they say java provides sound/network/graphics and other extensive libraries. They are self contradictory. C++ doesn't provide a native sound stl because their isn't anything as such. I don't think I would ever want to use a built in STL for graphics over OpenGL/DirectX which are sort of standard with enough freedom to do anything.

Yes, In C++ we are allowed more freedom with memory management compared to other languages which restrict memory access by default. Ok, there's no garbage collector and stuff. 

Also most say c++ has memory leaks. I feel that is good because your are in total control of what you do with the memory. Anyways, why would someone write code that leaks memory. Most memory leaks I have seen are when developers ignore safety warning of mighty pointers.
PS : In fact one of my CS projects was on memory leaks.

2207,2018-06-30 17:05:28,1,18,"**DZone** is publishing an article in a three part release on my company's new (to the rest of the Java community - have been using it in my work for 3 years) open source project:

[spartan ""forking"" java program launcher](https://dzone.com/articles/spartan-a-forking-java-program-launcher-part-1)

If interested and want to see the entire article instead of wait on the DZone instalments, just read its [README.md](https://github.com/tideworks/spartan-launcher/blob/master/README.md) on its github site.

As a way of synopsis description of what Spartan is, I'll actually start with the concluding paragraph of the README:

&gt;In other programming languages what **spartan** empowers  would perhaps not be very special. Concurrent programming via processes  is a rather ancient practice in computing. All manner of stalwart  programs that run as services on Linux, like PostreSQL, MySQL, Redis  (many others) - and desktop applications such as Chrome browser and  lately the Firefox brower - utilize multi-process concurrent programming  as core to how they are designed and operate.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, for the Java language, where this manner of programming now  becomes so facile, its very much like a new landscape of program  architecture is presenting itself. Enjoy.

Then here is the intro paragraph from the DZone article:

&gt;[Spartan](https://github.com/tideworks/spartan-launcher),  a GitHub-hosted, open source project, is a ""forking"" Java program  launcher — Java supervisor processes can launch Java child worker  processes (uses Linux fork and then instantiates JVM). Child programs  run as same user identity/permissions capability — no authentication or  special permissions necessary. Share the same Java code amongst parent  supervisor and children processes. Annotations mark entry point methods.

The project has three example programs that illustrate how to program via Spartan enabling capabilities.

I build a lot of pipeline services - written in Java - that run on and assume Linux underpinning. Spartan has been instrumental in making these services robust and self-healing. Plus flexible for bash scripting and invoking many child processes from the supervisor for parallelism.

In the old days I used to try to do these things with EJB beans in a monolithic Java app server - no more. Now I judiciously use child process programming via Spartan-based services and everything becomes more rock solid. It's been a game changer.","spartan ""forking"" java program launcher"

I planning to create a JAVA asynchronous webservice using CXF.

This is my understanding so far:

In order to create async webservice via best practice, it need to be in such way:

**Server:**

1. create an messanging queue like ActiveMQ, grab the webservice  request to put into an inbound queue and respond with an acknowledgement  synchronously
2. process the inbound queue via listener on queue
3. send response message back to client (via long polling from client)

**Client:**

1. send request to server
2. received acknowledgement message
3. send long polling to server until it received response from server

How do I achieve it if I would like to use **Callback approach** instead of polling approach?

Java team acknowledge the fact that it can do wonders and has a bright future in data science.  The rise of dl4j makes less distance from Java to Python. While Python is very good for prototyping and a favorite for academicians, there are lots of corporate engineers who use Java to migrate projects to the production and we have a powerful weapon so called maven! Java has bright future in Java. My effort was to grasp knowledge from various Python projects &amp; implementation sources, then make DL4J tutorial so that you don't have to refer Python to code a deep learning application. This is a transition time where we had to see Python code first because majority of machine learning algorithmic implementations are in Python. All data science organizations stress on Python based machine learning libraries for obvious reasons (fast research/algorithmic implementation, fast prototyping etc). While DL4J is my choice, there are other good options too. The target is, Java as one of the best language for data science applications.

with the new release plan and the end of public updates, is Oracle killing java for small businesses?

Let me explain. As a small team of developers having micro-services in Java and no commercial license, does that mean that now, every half a year, we'll have to update every services we have to the newest version or we'll be exposed without any updates? That means a lot of manpower being able to chase the latest version, update, test and everything for every service we have...

Am I understanding this correctly?",Is the upcoming situation with the new release plan of Oracle that bad ?

The mining process is running as a stand-alone job. Multiple such miners can run simultaneously, each of the miners is reporting how many hashes it calculated during one second. The information is collected by the UI, combined and presented to the user as the mining speed.

In my first implementation, I had a queue, sorted by the creation date of the miners reports, I limited it to 1000 entries and calculated the speed as an average of those reports.

I found the min report time and the max report time, calculated the delta and then calculated the total mining speed as the total hashes in all the reports in the queue divided by the delta time. 

However, I discovered that this calculation is incorrect as during the reporting of one miner the other miners continue to work, so I am losing part of the time. I thought it would result in a much bigger mistake then it ended up to be. But still, there is a much more simple and accurate solution.

The better solution is to not work with a queue but simply take the last report from each of the miners and calculate the time as the total time it took for the miners to produce the report and then divide the total hashes by that time.

Surprisingly the old method was only 5&amp;#37; wrong when comparing to the new one. The actual mining speed turned out to be a bit faster than the older measurements.","Calculating mining speed, it's not what you thought."

2246,2018-07-15 14:15:26,6,0,"# [C++ - Friend Function and Inline Function](http://programmingtrickk.blogspot.com/2018/07/c-friend-function-and-inline-function.html)

  
**Friend Function And Inline Function**  


**Friend Function**  
We know that private member function can not access outside the class but many times it happens that the member function of private  section ay need by other class member function so that we use **friend function.Because of friend function we use that particular function without using class.**  
 **Syntax:**  
**friend return\_type function\_name (argument list);**  
The friend function definition always created by outside the class .  
Eg:  
class emp{

\------------

Public:

void getdata ();

friend int printdata();

};

 void emp :: getdata()  //normal function.{---------  
}  
int printdata()  //friend function definition.{------  
}  
Friend function act  like normal function .It has object as argumentLets see one program with using friend function.  
**Simple addition program using friend function .**  
\#include&lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;  
class  addd

{  int a,b;

public:  void accept(); 

 friend void add(addd ob);};  
void addd :: accept()

   cout&lt;&lt;""enter a: ""; 

 cin&gt;&gt;a;

  cout&lt;&lt;""enter b: ""; 

 cin&gt;&gt;b; 

}

void add(addd ob)

{ 

 int  c= ob.a+ob.b; 

 cout&lt;&lt;c;

}

int main(int argc, char\*\* argv) { 

 addd ob; 

 ob.accept();  

add(ob);  

 return 0;}  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Output

enter a: 5

enter b: 38  
**Inline Function**  
If normal function call many times it may takes more time for execution science they take time to expand their functionality many times .so inline function is very useful method if function is large in size.Inline function provide type checking they are act like real function. So next thing came to your mind what is type checking. Type checking use to find out the errors at compile time and runtime. Basically type checking has two types  static and dynamic type checking so static will done at compile time and dynamic is done at run time.  
**Ex of Static type checking**  
int a=10;so static type checking check the datatype of  variable. It is used in C, C++ , JAVA ,C#.  
**Ex of Dynamic type checking**  
a=10;str=”Rohan”so in Dynamic type checking compiler itself know what is data type of variable .it used in  Python, VBScript programming language.  
**Below is**  **program of Normal function.**  
Eg:  
void add (int a, int b)

{

c=a+b;

}

int main()

{

add(10,20);

add(20,210);

add(20,39);

}

  
So when we run above program to much time is wasted.  
So we use inline function.  
**Syntax of inline function:**  
**inline return type function name(arguments);**  
**Below is program use to find** **square of number using inline function.**  
\#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;

\#include&lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

 int squre(int n)

{

  return(n\*n);

}

int main(int argc, char\*\* argv)

 {

  int num; 

 cout&lt;&lt;""enter the number:: "";

  cin&gt;&gt;num; 

 int sq=squre(num);

  cout&lt;&lt;""squre is : ""&lt;&lt; sq; 

 return 0;

}  
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Output

enter the number:: 5

squre is : 25

So I've become more competent with OO over the years, but there are still some details that escape me. I have a general question that isn't specific to PHP but OO in general.. though my program is in PHP so I thought I'd ask here.


What is the difference between me declaring a variable and setting a default value up at the class level as opposed to doing it in the class constructor.

I have several variables I need to declare with path names as a string that I don't want changed. I initially set them all in the constructor like:

$this-&gt;javaV7 = 'path to java7';

$this-&gt;javaV8 = 'path to java8';


But now I am reconsidering just putting them up above the constructor just as like:

private $javaV7 = 'path to java7';
private $javaV8 = 'path to java8;


I was wondering what the preferred method for setting a variable like this would be in an OO context. Ideally I'd like these strings as constants too, something like final in Java.. but that is a different topic and I really just want to know what the preferred method for declaring variables in the OO context is.

Case Project: Reserve a Restaurant App

Application title:              Reserve a Restaurant App

Purpose:              A restaurant reservation app provides a listing of at least 5 restaurants. By selecting a restaurant, users get info about the restaurant.

Algorithm:          1. An opening screen displays a welcome message (such as “Welcome to Restaurant App!”) and a button for users to go to the next screen.
2. The second screen displays a listing of restaurants. 
3. Some restaurants can be selected to view a Web site.
4. The others are local/small restaurants that do not have a Web site. When the user selects this type of restaurants, a third screen displays the name, street address, and city of the restaurant. In addition, and a Phone button is included in the screen.
5. After the Phone is “touched”, a “popup” message is displayed to show the restaurant’s phone number.   If the restaurant does not have a phone number, you display the message: “No phone number!”.
Conditions:         1. Create a Restaurant class including the Id, Name, City, Address, URL, and Phone Number properties. An array of Restaurant objects must be created by your Android activity and used by your Android adopter to show information of the restaurants. 
2. In the second page, create a custom layout for the list items.
3. Each list item displays the name and city of a restaurant in the list view.
4. If the phone number of the selected restaurant is not available (empty in the corresponding Restaurant object), you display a “popup” message saying that the restaurant phone number is not available. 
5. Each list item include an image (same for all of the restaurants).  You go to find/use your own image.
6. Create/use a single activity class &amp; its layout for all the restaurants without a Web site.
7. Include at least three restaurants without a Web site.
8. Include at least one restaurant without a phone number (the Phone Number property value is null or empty).
Bonus Points (10 pts):  Add an image Id property in the Restaurant class and a custom ArrayAdapter; then, you use them to display a list of 5 restaurants and show the image of each restaurant on the second screen.

Things I need help on:

POSTing an entity and retrial with an exponential time increase in the case of errors is as simple as this:

    client.post()
            .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
            .syncBody(entity)

The sophisticated `retry` variants (and not only `retry(times)` and the like) are usually only available with static methods, so you would have to wrap your Flux (similar to RxJava `Publisher`) with something like this:

    Retry.retryMax(5)
        .retryExponentialBackoff(...)
        .doOnRetry { ... }
        .apply(unreliableSource)

But thanks to the extension method `retryExponentialBackoff` it feels absolutely natural to use. In fact I only discovered after writing the code that it is an extension method. Thank you Pivotal!",Example of Spring's new Kotlin APIs

Most of the changes are internal; some abstraction layers have been removed and the WebSocket implementation has been completely rewritten.

Some of the major changes are:

* We've added ETag support and a method for auto-generating ETags
* We've added a RequestLogger interface (`{ ctx, executionTime -&gt; ...}`)
* We've added the option to return 405 instead of 404, listing available methods for the path
* We've added a set of default responses, so you can `throw BadRequestResponse()` (optional message)
* We've added a `CrudHandler` to remove some boilerplate from creating standard CRUD APIs
* We've added support for WebJars ([https://www.webjars.org](https://www.webjars.org))
* We've improved support for Single Page Applications
* We've improved exception handling for async requests
* All JSON and Template functionality has been modularized so you can easily plug in your own mappers/rendering engines.
* All Template functionality has been moved into a single `ctx.render()` function which uses the correct engine based on the file extension
* All requests run through an AccessManager now (but the default implementation is NOOP)
* URL matching is now case-insensitive by default (call `app.enableCaseSensitiveUrls()` if you must)
* Javalin now has a pac4j implementation ([https://github.com/pac4j/javalin-pac4j](https://github.com/pac4j/javalin-pac4j))
* Some default values have been changed

There are also a lot quality of life improvements, such as functions returning `List` instead of `Array`, returning empty collections instead of null, better default values and package structure, fixing visibility from Java, etc. Multiple bugs were hurt in the making of the new version.",Javalin 2.0 final release candidate is out

The idea of this simple application came to my mind at work when I was parsing logs for an application. The logs were huge and I had to parse a specific log which contained a JSON as a string. It was not pretty, so I would grep the line and paste it in my text editor, remove unnecessary string from start and end, and end up with a string which represented a JSON with still ugly \. I'd use the text editor to replace all '\' with '' (null character) and then copy the text and paste it in sites like jsonlint.com to pretty print it.

**Application:**

The task was tedious and robotic and every line of the log had the same steps to parse, so I thought of making a JAVA GUI application that would take the line of the log as input and then print the parsed JSON if possible.

**Problem:**

Using JavaFX, I have made a simple application, but it does not have colors on text fields and good lint for parsing like the online JSON parsers. I found a library called RichTextFx which adds more functionality to the JAVA GUI. But now:

1.  I'm having a lot of trouble understanding how to use the RichTextFx library.

2. The code looks very messy. This is because coding GUI like this involves a lot of formatting the nodes and scenes. I would like to separate the presentation layer from the layer that acts on it.

So, I've been searching across the net and found **electronjs** as a very popular option for webapp and desktop application. 

* What would you guys recommend? 
* Also, if you have built apps using JavaFX, why did you choose the framework, instead of say .NET where XAML exists for UI, or even electronJS?
* On a different note, how do I even begin to understand a public library like RichTextFx? It seems huge and the docs don't explain much.",Making a Desktop Application from scratch. What to use?

Unfortunately, that object does not exist when running on a Spark-Kotlin app, I believe because the  [ThymeleafTemplateEngine.java](https://github.com/perwendel/spark-template-engines/blob/master/spark-template-thymeleaf/src/main/java/spark/template/thymeleaf/ThymeleafTemplateEngine.java) file does not implement the required IWebContext interface.

2314,2018-08-12 13:41:43,56,58,"So, I've only just started diving into JDK levels above 8. Mostly because at my day job, we have begun preparing to migrate to JDK 11 for next year's release, so I've finally been motivated to start looking at the new features. This led me to Reactive Streams, and I am simultaneously impressed and underwhelmed.

I'm a big fan of the observable pattern. I love loose coupling, when I was first starting out as a programmer I was so obsessed with it I even created my own framework to try and ensure that an application could be completely compartmentalized with every piece 100% decoupled. It was definitely a bridge too far, but it was a nice learning experience.

So the idea of integrating observables with the stream API is awesome. And after finally finding a decent tutorial on it, I actually understand everything out-of-the-box in the JDK and how to use it properly. I can already see awesome opportunities for creating great pipelines of indirectly passing messages along. I like pretty much all of the design decisions that went into the java.util.concurrent.Flow API.

My problem is the lack of concrete implementations. To use just what's in the JDK, you have to write a LOT of boilerplate and be carefully aware of the rules and requirements of the API documentation. This leaves me wishing there was more, because it seems like a great concept.

There are third party implementations like RxJava I'm looking at, but I'm wondering if there are any plans to expand the JDK to include more concrete implementations.

Do I need I need to refresh my math skills to be more efficient? any tips

2- Also what did you do wrong when you started and you would differently if you were starting over?

3- What editor do you use? I use notepad++ at work computer. But use Atom here and there try to learn it. I heard sublime is good, but dont want to shell out $80.

I just finished school, and I have been developing primarily for Android for the past year. I am trying to get this Junior Java position though, and I have a hard time deciding on what to use to develop the test web app for the position. I have 1 week to do the app.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I need to create a web app where notes can be managed, with CRUD. The view should have the list of all the notes, I should also be able to search through them.

Hence, the questions are: what technologies should I use? Should it be just JaveEE or Spring also? Should I use GWT? If it is not GWT, what is frontend going to be written with? What about the database? Also, a stupid question: it is going to be a server-client application, right? Then, should there be multithreading?

I'm creating a package to deploy Java 8u181 in my domain.

I would like to find a way to avoid the need for all users to click ""Run"" and tick ""Do not show this again"" when launching our apps for the 1st time.

&amp;#x200B;

I managed to get to a point where the certificates (trusted.certs) are imported in the ""System"" certificates, as seen in java's control panel, section manage certificates.

I also populated the ""Exception sites"" list, but i'm not sure it even has any influence.

I must be missing something, because on 1st launch the users still have to click ""Run"" and tick ""Do not show again"".

After that, the same cert is listed both in System and User certificates (in java ctrl panel).

When they click and run the application, it won't prompt again after that.

&amp;#x200B;

But if they launch another app (on another server) which is signed by the same certificate, the java security prompt is there again.

So there must be something else i'm missing, something that links the trusted cert with a host ?

As you can see, sometimes Java displays with scientific notation and sometimes not. Also, it seems to me that java considers a number of decimal places where the last before the letter E is not 0. But I still can't figure out if that's exactly it.

One of my attempts was to put the number in a string (with snprintf using %.E), and then go fixing the number of decimal places, removing unnecessary zeros, etc. but it did not work very well (And it was not efficient at all. lol).

 So that's it, I need to display exactly the same as java (this includes without the plus sign too).

At least I don't have to know about the recipe until I need its feature but now I'm forced to know about `__init_subclass__` because foundation of class creation protocol has changed and the reason is that some packages have a lot of boilerplate metaclasses in their source code and for some Python programmers learning about metaclasses it too hard.

There are two variants of jvm there: hotspot, which seems to be the default oracle one, and eclipse/j9. My instinct was to go with hotspot, but some googling showed that j9 has considerably less memory usage and better perf. My project loads some machine learning models which take up a lot of memory (upto 7GB in 1.8), so I decided to try out jdk 10.0 J9.

Memory use dropped to about 2GB from 7GB and perf was slightly (10-20%) better too, and I had no issues w/ breaking code or anything! Everything just worked. (Apart from a small issue with some dependencies which was fixed easily by an upgrade).

2447,2018-10-01 05:06:34,1,1,"A first world problem happens when I first start coding my GUI and declare 10 Buttons which I need to initialize, set their size and set their action listeners. So I thought, why not make a simple program which writes all this boiler plate for me. I am aware that Netbeans has GUI builders but I hate them with all my heart since the code they make is horrible and non-editable. I tried it once when I first learnt Java and never again. I like hand coding my GUIs (weird since I want to autogenerate it lol).

&amp;#x200B;

So I was thinking about writing my own ""compiler/interpreter"" which reads very crappy pseudocode and writes it into real java code or a very simple GUI which allows me to create 10 buttons and set them up with just a few clicks. I am interested in the pseudo code since that involves writing an interpreter which I have never done so that could be fun. I was thinking the interpreter could read this:

&amp;#x200B;

`for(int x = 0; x &lt; 10; x++){`

`btn = new Btn;`

   `btn.size = 150, 30;`

   `btn.setActn;`

`}`

And declare 9 buttons named Button1, Button2 etc... Initialize them, set their pref size and also set their action listener so that I can just write the ""compiled"" archive into my netbeans projects and skip the boilerplate. Basically convert one iteration of the loop into this:

&amp;#x200B;

public class foo {

Button button1;



public foo(){

button1 = new Button();

button1.setPrefSize(150, 30);

buton1.setOnAction(e -&gt;{});

    for index, value in enumerate(a):
        print(index, value)

I know this can be done in kotlin using the method .withIndex()

    val a = listOf(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
    for ((index, value) in a.withIndex()) {

    # python
    a = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]
    for index, (odd, even) in enumerate(a):

2457,2018-10-04 09:00:07,15,1,"Factory/Builder methods are `static` methods used by a class to obtain an instance of it. As such, they function like constructors, many times even instead of a (private) constructor. These are still displayed with the rest of the methods in a JavaDoc page, though it makes more sense to put them with or next to the constructors.

The idea has been [brought up](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-4619333) ages ago, but was not implemented due to lack of interest. Today, the builder and factory patterns are more common and it's worth revisiting the idea. Several solutions were suggested, these are divided into how to do it and what the result is.

**How to**

1. An annotation on the method. (Which JDK package will that go in?)
2. A JavaDoc tag in the JavaDoc comment on the method.
3. Heuristic inclusion of `static` methods that return this type. (Some issues: what if the method returns a subclass? What if it's an inner builder class that returns a builder instance? Would that require an annotation to exclude false-positives or include true-negatives?)

**Result**

1. Methods will be displayed in the constructors summary.
2. Methods will have their own summary section (say between constructors and methods).
3. Methods will be displayed in a new tab of methods summary.

Go ahead and voice your opinions on any of the above.

Hey guys and gals, I've got a problem I could use some help with. A few years ago I let the 8th grade history teachers know that they could play Oregon Trail on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Oregon_Trail_The_1990). Everything was fine, kids got obsessed with it, were coming before and after school to play, and were learning at the same time. Our Network Admin noticed the traffic and banned [archive.org](https://archive.org/) because there are naughty things kids might find there.

I've spent the last year trying to find a way to play the game. Every instance I've managed to find on the net is blocked. I've looked at the [hand held version](https://www.target.com/p/handheld-oregon-trail-game/-/A-52719211) and [board game version](https://www.target.com/p/the-oregon-trail-game/-/A-50562794) available at Target however, they are not an approved vendor so we can't buy from them. My current solution is that I've spent my own money to buy [3 Pi Zeros kits](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0748NK116/r), plus the two I ready have, and I am installing Retro Pi to hopefully be able to play Oregon Trail (and Myst for my class to teach game design/Google Slides).

Here's my question, would it be possible to run a Oregon Trail server on a Raspberry Pi 3 or Zero, just like they have on [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Oregon_Trail_The_1990) where kids could visit an intra-net web-page and play the game? It would be a much better solution than me buying more Pi's since I'm broke af atm. Could anyone point me in the right direction?

Now I decided to learn it properly by reading the textbook: ""Spring In Action"" and now ""Pro Spring"". 

AOP is amazing! It solves so many issues I had in the past design wise IoC is also great, I want to use AOP on every OOP project I ever work on again! 

However here's the issue. I've read 260 pages of the ""Pro Spring 5th edition"" textbook and it keeps mentioning how Autowiring should be always avoided since it provides unnecessary overhead same for AOP it keeps refering to an example of preformance comparison between and advised and unadvised bean.

In my experience I haven't seen AOP used in the projects I worked on, but seen a lot of Autowiring. Which seems weird for me fo two reasons: 1) AOP is much more powerful than Autowiring, so people familiar with Spring should be highly motivated to use AOP as well and know about it. 2) Autowiring is more easily avoided and adds less benefits than AOP.

How common is it to use Spring AOP in real life projects? Is it worth the overhead?

2482,2018-10-16 20:03:13,1,1,"So as many of you already know, java 11 [removed Java EE](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/320#Java-EE-modules) from the JDK.  

 
Now from what I could understand, if we want to call a soap web service from Java SE 11 code, we don't have support for that anymore.

It seems that we now have to use the following maven dependency **only on the classpath**:  

     &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;com.sun.xml.ws&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;jaxws-ri&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;version&gt;2.3.1&lt;/version&gt;
      &lt;type&gt;pom&lt;/type&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;

Which work, (when on the classpath, not working on the module path).  

But we now need to bundle a **LOT** of jars just to be able to talk to a soap webservice.

Here's a look at the dependencies (There are more, I could skip some of them it seems) :

    FastInfoset-1.2.15.jar
    gmbal-api-only-3.1.0-b001.jar
    ha-api-3.1.9.jar
    istack-commons-runtime-3.0.7.jar
    javax.activation-1.2.0.jar
    javax.activation-api-1.2.0.jar
    javax.annotation-api-1.3.2.jar
    javax.jws-api-1.1.jar
    javax.xml.soap-api-1.4.0.jar
    jaxb-api-2.3.1.jar
    jaxb-runtime-2.3.1.jar
    jaxws-api-2.3.1.jar
    jaxws-ri-2.3.1.pom
    jaxws-rt-2.3.1.jar
    management-api-3.0.0-b012.jar
    mimepull-1.9.10.jar
    policy-2.7.5.jar
    saaj-impl-1.5.0.jar
    stax2-api-4.1.jar
    stax-ex-1.8.jar
    streambuffer-1.5.6.jar
    txw2-2.3.1.jar
    woodstox-core-5.1.0.jar


Is this the new normal under Java 11 ?  This can't be right !?

Would moving to some other type of service (REST?) be better ?

I built an ASP.Net Web Service for use in an intranet environment that is secured via Windows Authentication in IIS (not basic, not anonymous. the ""Windows Authentication"" option in the IIS auth settings). The Java developers, who are creating a client that will call this service which will run on a linux box, have told me that they cannot use Windows Auth, and asked me to switch it to Anonymous, and they will pass in the username and password in the call, which I can then validate with AD.

From my perspective, working exclusively in Microsoft stack, this is pretty backwards. But, I know approximately nothing about how to create a Java app that runs on Linux.

I'm new to the .NET languages, could you please verify the subjective statements from the topics are true? These are some claims the users made:

- [Ecosystem](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/9otg1z/in_what_ways_is_java_superior_to_c/e7wmr8i/): better build tools and package management.
- [Virtual machine](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/9otg1z/in_what_ways_is_java_superior_to_c/e7ws5u6/): JVM has a huge advantage over the CLR in the way the Hopspot JVM works. The .NET Core version of the CLR is only barely beginning to implement support for de-virtualizing method calls. And it will be years, if ever, before it handles automatic escape analysis. Sure, the CLR can be faster when using value types. But that requires a lot of work by the developer and is rarely suitable for public classes in reusable libraries.
- [LINQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/9otg1z/in_what_ways_is_java_superior_to_c/e7wnf39/): Java still beats C# on platform independence. I love Java Streams. Linq tries too hard to be some weird SQL mashup IMO. I don't like csproj files. I prefer a build system that can just grab what's in the src folder and build it.
- [Ease of use](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/9otg1z/in_what_ways_is_java_superior_to_c/e7x0a9w/): People talk about C#'s features like `out` variables, reified generics and `struct`s and I always think that it's a case of designing your language so your compiler/virtual machine/runtime system have less work to do. Java, on the other hand, generally designs things so they are simpler conceptually for users even though implementing a high-performance VM with them is much harder. I mean, why do you need out variables if you can \(efficiently\) return an object from your method? Why have `struct` vs `object` dichotomy?

Here's an example, code for a problem using heaps :-

Java:

    public static List&lt;String&gt; topK(int k,     Iterator&lt;String&gt; iter) {
    PriorityQueue&lt;String&gt; minHeap
= new PriorityQueue&lt;&gt;(k, new Comparator&lt;String&gt;() {
        public int compare(String s1, String s2) {
        return Integer.compare(s1.length(), s2.length());
        }
    });

    while (iter.hasNext()) {
        minHeap.add(iter.next());
        if (minHeap.size() &gt; k) {
            // Remove the shortest string. Note that the comparison function above
// will order the strings by length.
            minHeap.poll();
        }
        }
        return new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(minHeap);
    }


Python:

    def top_k(k, stream):
        # Entries are compared by their lengths.
        min_heap = [(len(s), s) for s in itertools.islice(stream, k)]
        heapq.heapify(min_heap)
for next_string in stream:
        # Push next_string and pop the shortest string in min_heap.
        heapq.heappushpop(min_heap, (len(next_string), next_string))
return [p[1] for p in heapq.nsmallest(k, min_heap)]


Now I am no Python expert so I don't know if this is just trying to be clever and using the shortest possible code, or is it actually the right way to do this. 

It certainly doesn't feel very similar in purpose requiring knowledge of itertools, islice and using nsmallest vs just the heap property like the Java code does.

I just joined a team which is very junior orientated in terms of backend / java.

One thing I spotted immediately is the lack of use the `final` modifier. 
I want to enforce a style guide and I am planning on forcing method params and private attributes to the final.

This will encourage good practices and get people thinking in terms of dependency injection and immutability of object references when being passed between functions.

Final classes may be enforced for API objects / DTOs however I am unsure whether that will be too extreme or not.

Ritik is a man of dreams, he keeps dreaming day and night, wondering about space and time, sci-fi and a lot more. Today is yet another day when he dreamed about a Galactic Grid where he was supposed to rescue his friend Kriti. Now this Grid is slightly unusual consisting of two species Vilgax and Arkaknight.
Vilgax is bad and can freeze you for some time whereas Arkaknight is good and lets you jump from one place to another.
The Grid is made up of m rows and n columns. Each cell consists of an integer either positive, negative or zero.There are exactly two zeroes one at top-left corner and the other at bottom-right corner of the grid representing initial positions of Ritik and Kriti respectively.

A positive integer represents an Arkaknight. It gives you the power to jump from cell to another containing the same integer anywhere within the grid. For example - a cell containing 2 can let you jump to any other cell containing 2 in the grid if there is one.
A negative integer represents a Vilgax. It freezes for a certain period of time that is you cannot move for certain units of time represented by the absolute value of the integer present in that cell.For example , a cell containing -3 makes you freeze for 3 units of time in that cell i.e you cannot move or jump to any other cell.
Ritik can also move to any cell that share a common wall i.e adjacent to each other ( top, left, right and bottom ) within the grid. It takes one unit of time to jump from one cell to another.
Your task is to tell the minimum units of time taken by Ritik to reach Kriti given the grid of m x n.

Input Format
First line of input contains number of rows  - M.
Second line of input contains number of columns  - N.
Then M lines of input follows each containing N integers respectively.
Note : The Positive integers will range from [ 1, M * N ] both inclusive and negative integers can range from [-1 , -( M * N ) ] both inclusive.

Constraints
1 &lt;= M &lt;= 1000 
1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000

Output Format
Print the minimum units of time taken by Ritik to reach Kriti.
Sample TestCase 1
Input
3
3
0 2 3
-1 2 -3
3 2 0
Output

Explanation
From initial position of Ritik, he can move to right cell or bottom cell , moving to bottom cell containing -1 can cause him to freeze for 1 unit of time so he will move to cell containing 2, now from here he can to any of the 2 in the grid or move to adjacent cell, best is to move to cell ( 3 , 2 ) containing 2, now from here he can move to cell (3,3) where Kriti is present.Hence 3 moves.

ASM 7.0 has been released with official support for java 11 (java 12 should work too). ASM is used for bytecode manipulation in many popular java libraries, including cglib, spring, and hibernate and many more. it's also used for continuations and green threads, eg by kilim and quasar. there don't appear to be any changes relative to the beta (which was released shortly after java 11) but this should allow other libraries to release official java 11 support

&amp;#x200B;

from the ASM team per the mailing list (spam protection prevents direct link):

&gt;Release notes (diff from 6.2.1):  
  
&gt;  
&gt;\- support of JDK 11 features now official (was experimental)  
\- xml package deleted (was deprecated since 6.1)  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Small improvements:  
\- Type and TypePath now explicitly final  
\- Eliminate double-spaced output from Textifier  
\- New initJumpTarget method in Frame  
\- Remap inner class names in Remapper  
\- Better UnsupportedOperationException messages  
\- Javadoc improvements  
\- Check code quality with Checkstyle and PMD  
\- Fix performance regression introduced in 6.2  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Bug fixes:  
\- 317847: Gradle build missing Implementation-Version property  
\- 317848: Type names no longer included in declaration comments produced by  
Textifier  
\- 317851: Analyzer gets StackOverflowError when method has lots of jumps  
\- 317853: SimpleVerifier merges types incorrectly when one type is an  
interface  
\- 317856: Bug in AdviceAdapter with superclass constructors  
\- MethodWriter generates incorrect bytecode for long or double ConstantDynamic  
\- Remapper does not remap ConstantDynamic and Handle correctly  
\- Rollback of !177: Ensure instructions belong only to one list

And one day I realised that music players don't offer me enough flexibility: there's no setting to play favourite songs more often than others, there's no such thing as dynamic playlists(at least not in the sense that I want), etc etc - so I've decided to make a player myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, it has to play locally stored music, so no integration with sites, at least for now, is planned. It has to run both on my pc and android phone - and here I'm a bit lost. I don't want to code two apps if possible, but its behavior will differ on pc and android. Also, backend's on java(as my primary coding language), so... well, REST api can do just fine there.

&amp;#x200B;

What are the best frameworks/tools to use in this scenario? I've heard Ionic+Cordova is good for cross-platforming, and React native is somewhat worse in terms of ""write once - run everywhere"" but much faster, not that it needs to be crazy fast. Or maybe both options suck here?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if there are enthusiastic(and somewhat skilled) front-end devs who want to participate, PM me!","Architecture advice on creating music player (Cordova, native react, something else?)"

**What is done:**

\-implementation of [ScheduledExecutorService](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html)

\-you can advance time by X, all scheduled tasks between old and new date will be completed

\-using the same object you can obtain current time (and also manipulating 'now' date during tests)

**Whats is planned to be done:**

\-figure out way to handling exceptions during tasks execution

\-make everything thread-safe

\-write more tests

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't like how inflexible all the music players are. Say, you have 2k songs and 20 playlists, now the situations:

* Want a playlist that only includes songs from your ""Epic"" playlist that are wordless? Make a new one, add all songs manually.
* Want to play some songs more often/rare than others? Tough - the best you can do is add a song several times and put it on random/shuffle.
* Added 15 more songs to 8 different folders? go manually over each and add it to all the albums you think it fits.

etc etc. As a coder, this is something I could solve, so I've made a prototype. It works nicely and solves the issues I've had with other players neatly, also adding potential for some nice features, like:

novelty of the song: starts at max, making its chance of playing initially higher, then gradually blends with others;

precise statistic of what genres you listened over time;

fine-tuning of equalizer, volume, speed for each song if need be;

maybe mass rating of songs' stats (e.g. this song is on average 7.2 'metal', 5.4 'folk', 8 'epic' ...) though for that it need to go from ""every user rates for themselves"" to some public model.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the issue is that this prototype has an interface me and my friend(who's tester at heart) are capable of, which is javaFX and its baaad. I intend to make the backend from scratch (there are good reasons for that), but I have little to no exp in making front-end, and the whole player would suck just because of that.

So, I'm looking for a front-end buddy(at least at a junior+ level, sorry HelloWorlds!), who'd like to try his hand at making an open-source, non-commercial *awesome* player.

&amp;#x200B;

Two words on architecture: in-memory DB(like h2), spring with rest api, for front-end there are some options: any js framework in Ionic+Cordova, perhaps in WebView of javaFX; React native; just js framework in browser; or whatever you're comfortable with I guess(so long as it's not javaFX).

Later may come AWS, Docker, CDN, and many other clever words, but that's after the core is fully done.

Also, if the player does somehow generate profit(maybe patreon or licence), I intend to just use it for its development.

**How can I call Google Translate API in any programming language? I am trying with Python but it keeps throwing ""Unsupported characters in input"".**

[Google Translate API](https://cloud.google.com/translate) can dynamically translate text between thousands of language pairs. It allows websites and programs integrate with the translation service programmatically. Google Translate API is part of the larger Google Cloud Machine Learning API family. It provides a single programmatic interface designed to help developers translate a string of arbitrary data into a supported language using Neural Machine Translation. The Google Translate API is highly responsive which makes the applications and websites that use the API often fast allowing for dynamic translation between texts. For example, you can use Google Translate API in your website so that any user outside your country can decide whether they want to translate the text to their native language.

With Google Translate you can enjoy natural language detection so that you can even detect the meaning of the text the source language of which you might not know. Few of the key benefits of using Google Translate API are:

1. Google Translate API can be easily integrated into any programming language. It’s a simple REST API. You don’t need to worry about extracting texts from documents. Just send HTML documents into the mix.

2. With the help of Google Translate API you can understand a host of languages. It supports more than 100 different languages. When used in combination, this enables a translation of thousands of different language pairs.

3. It helps in Natural Language Detection which means you might not know the source language of the text in advance. Since user-generated content generally does not contain a language code, it helps you to automatically identify the language with high degree of accuracy.

4. It is highly scalable with any volume of data. You can set your limits as per your budget &amp; requirement as Google provides a high enough daily quota.

In order to call Google Translate API in your programming language you need to setup a [GCP console project](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/quickstart-client-libraries). Once you setup the project you need to enable the Cloud Translation API for that project and download a private key as JSON. Then install the client library for your programming language. Google provides client libraries for different programming languages such as [C#](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/quickstart-client-libraries#client-libraries-install-csharp), [Go](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/quickstart-client-libraries#client-libraries-install-go), [Java](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/quickstart-client-libraries#client-libraries-install-java), [Node.js](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/quickstart-client-libraries#client-libraries-install-nodejs), [Php](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/quickstart-client-libraries#client-libraries-install-php), [Python](https://www.learntek.org/blog/python-enumerate/) &amp; [Ruby](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/quickstart-client-libraries#client-libraries-usage-ruby). Google also provides a sample code for you to test your API for each programming language.

To call Google Translate API in Python there are various libraries available such as [Goslate](https://pythonhosted.org/goslate/) and [googletrans](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/). 

Installing googletrans library

$ pip install googletrans

Basic Usage with sample code

If source language is not given, google translate attempts to detect the source language.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; from googletrans import Translator

\&gt;&gt;&gt; translator = Translator()

\&gt;&gt;&gt; translator.translate('안녕하세요.')

\# &lt;Translated src=ko dest=en text=Good evening. pronunciation=Good evening.&gt;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; translator.translate('안녕하세요.', dest='ja')

\# &lt;Translated src=ko dest=ja text=こんにちは。 pronunciation=Kon'nichiwa.&gt;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; translator.translate('veritas lux mea', src='la')

\# &lt;Translated src=la dest=en text=The truth is my light pronunciation=The truth is my light&gt;

Language Detection

For language detection googletrans uses the detect method to identify the language used in a given sentence.

\&gt;&gt;&gt; from googletrans import Translator

\&gt;&gt;&gt; translator = Translator()

\&gt;&gt;&gt; translator.detect('이 문장은 한글로 쓰여졌습니다.')

\# &lt;Detected lang=ko confidence=0.27041003&gt;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; translator.detect('この文章は日本語で書かれました。')

\# &lt;Detected lang=ja confidence=0.64889508&gt;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; translator.detect('This sentence is written in English.')

\# &lt;Detected lang=en confidence=0.22348526&gt;

\&gt;&gt;&gt; translator.detect('Tiu frazo estas skribita en Esperanto.')

\# &lt;Detected lang=eo confidence=0.10538048&gt;

However, Google has its own method when using its API with Python

\# Imports the Google Cloud client library  
 from google.cloud import translate  
 

\# Instantiates a client  
 translate\_client = translate.Client()  
 

\# The text to translate  
 text = u'Hello, world!'  
 \# The target language  
 target = 'ru'  
 \# Translates some text into Russian  
 translation = translate\_client.translate(  
text,  
target\_language=target)  
 

print(u'Text: {}'.format(text))  
 print(u'Translation: {}'.format(translation\['translated Text'\]))

In order to prevent the **""Unsupported characters in input""** error while working with the api simply specify the character encoding of the input file**.**

A wondrous square is an n by n grid which fulfils the following conditions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. It contains integers from 1 to n2, where each integer appears only once.
2. The sum of integers in any row or column must add up to 0.5 \* n \* (n2 + 1)  
. 

For example the following grid is a wondrous square where the sum of each row or column is 65 when n = 5 : 

    17 24 2 8 15 
    23 5 7 14 16 
    4 6 13 20 22 
    10 12 19 21 3 
    11 18 25 2 9 

Write a program to read n (2 &lt; = n &lt; = 10) and the values stored in these n by n cells and output if the grid represents a wondrous square or not. 

Also output all the prime numbers in the grid along with their row index and column index as shown in the output. A natural number is said to be prime if it has exactly two divisors. E.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,....... 

The first element of the given grid i.e. 17 is stored at row index 0 and column index 0 and the next element in the row i.e. 24 is stored at row index 0 and column index 1

The need for Java developers is felt worldwide, especially in companies that are in some way or the other associated with Information Technology. The companies involved with functions like software testing, database designing, website development, cell phone programming, intranet or internet designing etc. are the ones hiring these professionals the most. Hence, more and more employers today, are hiring individuals with a promising past experience in java coding and developing.

These jobs are offered readily to whoever deserves them and they are equally readily taken away from the individuals who fail to perform their part. As a Core JAVA developer, it is important that you understand the basic roles and responsibilities that your position bestows on you. This will not only help you to save your job but will also allow you to make good progress in the field of [Java development](https://www.learntek.org/blog/use-java-in-web-technology/).",The Growing Demand for Java Developers

As part of course I did complete some visual basic, excel and java coding but this was all pretty simple. What I would like to find out from you guys is whether engineers are employed for our strong analytical thinking and mathematical skills? As well as, where do I start looking?

6. If the user picked to ""Stay"" then it will record how many rounds they won and lost, and then do that for each successive round.

I have inherited a small to medium sized codebase, Java 6, JBoss 5.1 a JSF based web interface and some Swing UI.

In my opinion, the UI could theoretically be all web, although at  some customers its used quite heavily with not much trained personnel.  But in the end - its just some buttons - and it has to work reliably.

Our systems (specialized hardware + the software) has to work for  15-20 years+ (or rather be maintainable for that timeframe). There is  also the aspect that parts of the software has to be certified by our  equivalent of the NIST (which means updates are possible, but have to be  limited).

I want to gradually rewrite the software, preferably stay in the Java ecosystem.

I'm quite apprehensive about the current state of Java UI frameworks -  Swing is dead, JavaFX is developed further as OpenJFX, but for how  long? Or should I rather use SWT (it has at least a good track record of  being around and be maintained)?

On the other hand, if I go webUI, I quite like Vue.js, but will it be around for the foreseeable future?

So the question is: If you would decide for a Java Stack, with  moderate UI requirements, what technologies would you choose under the  constraint that it will/should probably around in 20 years?",Future proof Java &amp; UI

Problem : There are a large number of files continuously posted on an FTP server that we need to grab, process and pass on.

Solution Idea: A master node will look for new files on an FTP server, and assign processing work to child nodes. The master node will send a JMS message to the child telling them which file to process and the child will send a response back when it is done, and ask for more work.

If the master node goes down for some reason, one of the child nodes should presume the role of master. My idea for implementing this was to have a ""lock"" collection in a MongoDB that contains info about the master node, as well as a lock expiration time. Every 15 seconds or so the master node will refresh their lock and update the expiration time to 30 seconds in the future. If the child nodes sees the lock is expired, one of them will assign itself as the master node.

I'm looking for feedback on this design, and wondering if anyone has advice on improvements/java frameworks or tools that already exist that I can leverage for something like this.

&gt; [Project Page](https://hexworks.org/projects/zircon/).

&gt; You can grab this release from Jitpack [here](https://jitpack.io/#org.hexworks/zircon/2018.12.25-XMAS).
&gt; Maven Central synchronization will come soon as well.

## Highlights of this release

This release contains numerous usability upgrades and the introduction of new `Component` types
like `Modal`s and the `Icon` `Component`. We also worked on fleshing out the inner workings of
the `GameArea` based on feedback from our users.

We also started working on [Caves of Zircon](https://github.com/Hexworks/caves-of-zircon) which
is a tutorial project which has the goal to get you started with writing roguelike games!
The project is almost complete and when it is ready a series of tutorial articles will follow.
Take a look at some game footage [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/509142267735310338/522176966984597545/GIF.gif).

Apart from a tutorial project there is now also a Java and a Kotlin skeleton project which you
can download to get started with Zircon without the need to manually set up a project.
The Java skeleton can be found [here](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon.skeleton.java)
and the Kotlin one is [here](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon.skeleton.kotlin). 

What's also important to mention is that now we have a **LibGDX Renderer** for Zircon! It is in
beta right now, but we'll get it to production-ready state for the next release. Thanks for @Ender_L
for contributing it to the project! With this it is now possible to **run Zircon in the browser**.
We'll put up an example with this soon.

## New Features

- [#1](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/1): *LibGDX rendering support*
  Yea, **this was the first issue** in our issue tracker and now we have it in BETA.
  Thanks for the contribution, @Ender_L! [These](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363754040103796737/521809619186745347/unknown.png)

  using the new [LibGDX renderer](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363754040103796737/521807314190073857/unknown.png).
  CP437 fonts are supported now together with `Input` handling. `Animation`, `Modifier` and the remaining tileset
  support will come in the next release! 
- [#24](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/24): *Modal (dialog) support*
  This one was on the Road map for quite some time, but it is ready now! Take a
  look at this [example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/514477514161389599/dialog_example.gif).
- [#121](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/121): *Programmatic focus for Components*
  Now it is possible to programmatically focus `Component`s. Take a look at an example
  [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/510230515429670922/focus_handling_example.gif).
- [#153](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/153): *Implement Ellipse Factory*
  Now you can draw not only triangles, rectangles and boxes, but also ellipse shapes!
  Thanks for @Milo for this contribution!
- [#156](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/156): *Databinding Iteration 1*
  Zircon now supports databinding. It looks like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363754040103796737/525042125151141939/data_binding_with_labels.gif).
  This feature might be familiar from JavaFX or some other UI framework. The basic premise is that
  you can create `Property` instances which you can bind to other properties and their values
  will change together. Databinding is possible uni-, and bidirectionally and it is implemented
  for the basic `Component`s in Zircon.
- [#171](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/171): *Fragment Support*
  A `Fragment` is a re-usable `Component` container which contains a `root` `Component`
  (which can also be a `Container` and can be added to either a `Container` or a `Screen`.
- [#172](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/172): *Implement the Icon Component*
  An `Icon` `Component` is a regular `Component` which has a size of 1x1 and holds a single `GraphicTile`.
  It looks like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363754040103796737/526092651775393809/unknown.png)
  and can be used to put icons on your UI.
  


## Enhancements

- [#132](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/132): `TextArea`s now can be [enabled and disabled](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/509836757798354954/text_area_enable_disable.gif)
  once again. This feature was removed previously because of some technical limitations, but now it is fixed.
- [#133](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/133): `Layer`s are now clearable
- [#145](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/145): `Component` alignment is now easier
  with the new alignment functions. Take a look [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/515978944948994048/component-positioning.png).
- [#152](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/152): Borders now support custom width
  and also custom color like in [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363754040103796737/519083254284943360/unknown.png)
  example.
- [#154](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/154): Handling `Input`s are now easier with
  some new convenience features like `whenInputTypeIs` and `whenCharacterIs`.
- [#155](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/155) `GameArea` now supports adding overlays.
  This is useful for creating things like Fog of War effects as seen in [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/509142267735310338/525811202551447553/coz_xp.gif)
  example.
  

## Bug fixes

- [#122](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/122): Weird effect if label has FadeIn modifier
- [#158](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/158): When different tilesets are set only one of them is used.
- [#128](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/128): Bug in README.md document example

## Roadmap
  
There are some things which did not make it into this release, but will be present in the next release,
like the [Group Component](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/123) and
[Event Bubbling](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/126).

Apart from those we have some things which are quite interesting:

- Browser support with Pixi.js
- Floating windows
- Toolbars
- Drag'n drop support
- Concurrency / parallelism refactoring to use Kotlin Coroutines
- Scrollable `Component`s
- Slider widget
- Drop down menus
- Custom `Component` support
- Layout support

2698,2018-12-27 16:13:53,3,1,"Hi,

I'm trying to hide the cursor in a html page using java script, i didn't write the js, i'm just trying to edit the file so the cursor won't show when the file is opened in the browser. From what i gather the js is using a library called createjs, i have been able to hide cursor (change the property to none, so it won't show), but the file has a button that when the mouse is above i get the 'pointer' cursor which is what i'm trying to solve at the moment. I tried a few different things, but none seems to work, i can move the button around the canvas and change it size, but not the cursor.

  I left java when it was 1.2 (geez I feel old now) and used mostly python and other languages.

2702,2018-12-28 19:31:44,14,1,"So my background is like this:

I have a BA in IT.

I have worked as a tech support but i hated it.

I'm in my early 30s and now I'm living off of savings. I want to get a job related to python programming asap.

  
I've started learning to code 8 months ago with freecodecamp, I've learned html,css,sass,jquery and some JavaScript ,3 months ago i started  a bootcamp in mobile dev, unsure on what i wanted to do.then i realized i hate java and swift and didn't want to get a job as a mobile [dev.](https://dev.so) so basically i wasted 3 months on a tech that i hate now.

during the bootcamp i did finish some very basic projects like a calculator , we were rushed to learn so many things in 3 months and basically for those apps i copied and pasted the code,mostly not understanding what i was doing. and i feel like a fraud .

after these experiences now i know i don't like JavaScript and I hate Java and Swift and the slow and pathetic android studio and xcode which i had to suffer these three months.

recently i was so sad on why i can't choose a programming language and stick to it, till i saw a video of this guy.

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A)

He is talking about artificial intelligence , machine learning and some amazing stuff and i realized i had to learn python to enter this world.

So now I'm learning the basics of python with this course:

[https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-foundations-with-python--ud036)

 and plan to do this course to build some projects:

[https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-python-course/](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-python-course/)

&amp;#x200B;

Right now i'm enjoying learning python.I think compared to java,JavaScript and swift, this is a sweet language.

But i want to get a job as fast as possible.

this is one of the internships that i'm interested in:

 **Candidates must have:** 

**·**   
**competency**   
**in at least one of the following languages: Python, Java, C#, C++**   


**·**   
**knowledge**   
**of fundamental computer science concepts such as data structures and algorithms**   


**·**   
**knowledge**   
**of software design, architecture and patterns**   


**·**   
**comfortable**   
**working extensively with version control systems like Git**   


But the problem is i don't know anything about **data structures and algorithms.they didn't teach that in bootcamp and i really want to apply for this internship.**

how can i do that even I'm a newbie in python and i have very noob projects in java and swift,which i didn't understand the building process and just copied and pasted the code.

I don't want to include those projects in my portfolio because i can't explain them if someone asks.

My goal is to work in artificial intelligence and machine learning field.since i'm new i don't even know the difference but i'm trying to learn everyday and the idea excites me.

2730,2019-01-08 17:34:04,7,1," I just wanted to share the recent release of a project I've been working on. ​ [Kroto+](https://github.com/marcoferrer/kroto-plus) ​ now supports generating coroutine based gRPC client and service stubs. You can clone and run the following pre-configured [template project](https://github.com/marcoferrer/kotlin-coroutines-gRPC-template) to get started. Existing Kroto+ users can add the `grpc_coroutines{}` to their build configuration.

* **Back pressure** is supported via [Manual Flow Control](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/tree/master/examples/src/main/java/io/grpc/examples/manualflowcontrol)
   * Related Reading: [Understanding Reactive gRPC Flow Control](https://github.com/salesforce/reactive-grpc#back-pressure)
* **Cooperative cancellation** is propagated across network boundaries. Meaning a cancelled client `coroutineContext` attached to a stub will cancel the related rpc job within the service impl.
* Full Bi-directional streaming using coroutine Channels
* Client Stubs
   * Implement `CoroutineScope` interface
   * Designed to work well with **Structured Concurrency**
   * Cancellations can now be propagated across usages of a specific stub instance.
   * Rpc methods are overloaded with inline builders for request types

&amp;#8203;

    // CLIENT
    val stub = GreeterCoroutineGrpc.newStub(channel)
        .withCoroutineContext() // or .withCoroutineContext(coroutineContext)
    
    val response = stub.sayHello { name = ""John"" }
    
    // SERVICE
    override suspend fun sayHello(request: HelloRequest): HelloReply = coroutineScope {
        if (isValid(request.name))
            HelloReply { message = ""Hello there, ${request.name}!"" } else
            throw Status.INVALID_ARGUMENT.asRuntimeException()
    }

Examples for other rpc variations can be found [here](https://github.com/marcoferrer/kroto-plus#examples).

Kroto+ also supports generating lambda based builders and extensions for proto messages. 

        val attack = Attack {
            name = ""ORA ORA ORA""
            damage = 100
            range = StandProto.Attack.Range.CLOSE
        }
        
        //Copy extensions are also generated
        val newAttack = attack.copy { damage = 200 }            
        
        //As well as plus operator extensions 
        val mergedAttack = attack + Attack { name = ""Sunlight Yellow Overdrive"" }

&amp;#x200B;

Any feedback is welcomed as well as suggestions for new features and improvements.   


Also in the works is a prototype for generating multiplatform data classes from proto definitions using [Kotlinx Serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization). Feel free to contribute to the design discussion.

2742,2019-01-12 10:31:04,5,1,"Let's say we have:

```
data class MyModel(val id: String, val a: String, val b: Int, val c: LocalDate)
```

This is fine, but what do we do when we want to create a new entity in the web UI, and receive that (in kotlin) from our API? I.e. our choices would (seem to) be either a) allow id to be nullable or b) allow the UI to choose an id, even if temporary (both of which seem undesirable).

We've been noodling around with using a dynamic proxy to implement an interface, and having our data class also implement that interface. That is, our entity now becomes:

```
    // implementation of ProxyDeserializer comes next
    class MyModelDeserializer: ProxyDeserializer&lt;MyModel&gt;(MyModel::class.java)

    @JsonDeserialize(using = MyModelDeserializer::class)
    interface MyModel { val a: String ; val b: Int ; val c: LocalDate }

    data class MyModelEntity(val id: String, override val a: String, override val b: Int, override val c: LocalDate) : MyModel
```

Now that we have MyModel as an interface, we can use it liberally throughout our code. Wherever we really need the id, we can use MyModelEntity. The API gets a MyModel, which we can send to the DAO to be persisted.

The ProxyDeserializer implementation isn't too bad (and obviously is reusable across entities):

```
private val mapper = Jackson.newObjectMapper().registerModule(KotlinModule())

open class ProxyDeserializer&lt;T&gt;(private val clzz: Class&lt;T&gt;): JsonDeserializer&lt;T&gt;() {

    override fun deserialize(p0: JsonParser, p1: DeserializationContext): T {
        // convert to a json container which we can interrogate when needed
        val node = p0.readValueAs(ObjectNode::class.java)
        return Proxy.newProxyInstance(ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader(),
                arrayOf(clzz), DynamicJsonProxy(node, clzz)) as T
    }
}

class DynamicJsonProxy&lt;T&gt;(private val delegate: ObjectNode, clzz: Class&lt;T&gt;) : InvocationHandler {

    private val getters = Introspector.getBeanInfo(clzz).propertyDescriptors.map { it.readMethod }
    private val cache = CacheBuilder.newBuilder().build&lt;Method, Any&gt;()

    override fun invoke(proxy: Any, method: Method, args: Array&lt;Any&gt;?): Any? {
        // allow methods to be called multiple times without reparsing
        return cache.get(method) {
            if (method in getters) {
                val propertyName = method.name.substring(3).toLowerCase()
                // use jackson to extract this property as this return type
                return@get mapper.treeToValue(delegate.get(propertyName), method.returnType)
            } else null
        }
    }
}
```

There's various smells here that I'd appreciate ideas on improving.

a) Obviously this pushes parse errors to read time, i.e. the DAO could potentially be the ""source"" of json parsing errors, which would be confusing. That's why I wrapped the method accessors in a cache - the idea might be that there's some validation routine that runs through all getters once at the API level to do the initial parsing.

b) Using method.name.substring to dump the ""get"" from the method name isn't satisfactory. Is there a way to do that in a more elegant way?

c) I'm leaning on Java reflection rather than Kotlin. Are there more kotlin-y replacements for some of the stuff I'm doing that'd work? 

d) I also don't love the MyModelSerializer, even though it's a one liner, but I can't see any other way to get the type into the ProxyDeserializer. Is there some fancy kotlin annotation magic that'd streamline this?

Hello all,

Thanks in advance for reading this. I recently have decided to begin learning to program and I really need some advice.

My background: I've be a web designer for almost 8 years, but I'd say I'm more than just a designer... My specialty is WordPress and I know how to get into the php files in WordPress and make adjustments, add page templates, edit files, and configure some java script files. I just recently migrated a database driven web application from another server and had to update all the queries from MYSQL to MYSQLI... I've implemented custom built web designs into OpenCart themes and edited the PHP modules within OpenCart... All of that being said I can't write a custom PHP application by any means (I could probably do a mail script lol), or a JS file from scratch. I've also even fallen behind a bit on my responsive website design, I mean I'm fine when utilizing WordPress builders but I would need to brush up with the proper @media queries for responsiveness across devices - I'm sure I could get a bootstrap one pager rocking from scratch pretty quick though if I google a few things to brush up... Gone are the days I can just use DIVs and CSS.... Haha. I honestly could get a front-end developer role pretty quickly if it's building websites and just editing scripts that were already in place... (Google is your friend).

All of that being said, I've decided to start learning Python and have been working my way through an 8 hour class on skill-share. I'm really enjoying it, but not sure if I am heading down the wrong road... Since I already have a solid foundation with front-end stuff (HTML/CSS really) and ability to edit PHP, and JS functions a bit... Should I be focusing on beefing up my responsive design a bit and learning Javascript? I've always thought JS is so convoluted looking and python seems to be coming easily so far (I'm only a couple hours in). I've had freelance gigs as a front end developer before and solved problems by studying solutions on stack overflow etc...

One other thing before the advice... I've always been terrible at math. For context I had to start in pre-pre algebra in college. I get the logic of it, and of course am fine with simple expressions and variables. I am a creative, I love creating new things - weather that be the audio engineering I do as a hobby, or my design. I know this may a bit of rambling, and please excuse my grammatical errors and such... I'm kinda tired lol. I'm excited about coding though and looking forward to a strong future in tech.

Thank you all!",Learning to program - unique situation... Need advice - JS yes?

... and got the following error:

... and discovered that NOW, \*\*there is no\*\* java.exe anywhere in the execution path.

Ok, I figured that maybe my mass-uninstallation screwed something up.

2791,2019-01-27 22:52:20,14,1,"So, last year I decided to learn Kotlin. Here is my little story so far:

Last year in my spare time, I was trying to design a high level programming language, and a compiler for it, targeting the old skool 8-bit 6502 CPUs as used in the Commodore-64 for instance. I was writing this in Python, but didn't like where it was going and had troubles with restructuring and refactoring the growing code base (execution speed was never an issue though).

So I switched to Kotlin to see if it would fit my project better, and to learn this promising language at the same time.

This week the first beta version of my compiler was released (if you're interested you can find it here [https://github.com/irmen/prog8](https://github.com/irmen/prog8)  documentation is here [https://prog8.readthedocs.io/](https://prog8.readthedocs.io/) )

After all the effort over the past few months in my spare time, I have to conclude that Kotlin is rather awesome. It didn't take long to learn the basics, and the refactoring hints in the IDE (I'm using IDEA) were teaching me a lot as well. As expected, restructuring and refactoring are a breeze. I like the language a lot but there are a few things that strike me as a little problematic:

* the compilation times are unexpectedly long. It takes kotlinc on my ryzen 2700x machine about 50 seconds to recompile everything into a jar. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong here.  (when using the incremental builds from within the IDE this problem is absent thankfully)
* it's awesome and unfortunate at the same time that Kotlin runs on the JVM. Integrating java code is almost trivial (and I'm using this for an antlr4 generated parser). However sometimes I ran into limitations that seem arbitrary but are caused by the JVM (such as: functions can never return more than one value, type erasure in generic collections causing issues in the kotlin type system)

I still think I could have succeeded my project with Python eventually, but switching to Kotlin was the better decision.",I used Kotlin to make a cross-compiler for 8 bit 6502 CPU machines such as the Commodore-64

Now (after about 2 years of free-time Java self-learning) I think I get it. I’ve read countless amount of tutorials and courses including one book (Headfirst), BUT:

Now when I’m trying to build slightly bigger software, I often get that “that’s wrong, don’t do that” feeling when it comes to using static variables. I think it’s because most of the tutorials seem to encourage readers not to use them because “it’s not OOP”...

In my opinion, it’s OK to use static as long as there’s no better way to do the same task with instance variable, my problem is that there’s no one who could say “Yes, that’s correct”

Hey /r/csharp'ers. For the past few months I've been beavering away in my spare time to produce the initial version of my Atomic types library (something that I think C# is missing).

Copied from the github readme:

Atomics is a C#/.NET Standard 2.0 library aimed at providing thread-safe wrappers for mutable shared state variables.

Please note: This library is currently in alpha. There is no inline documentation yet and the API is liable to minor changes.

## Library Features

* Provides built-in mechanisms for operating on mutable variables in discrete, atomic operations; including 'basics' like compare-and-swap/increment etc. but also more complex or arbitrary routines, making it easier to reason about potential concurrent accesses and eliminate accidental race conditions.
* Helps ensure that all accesses to wrapped variables are done in a threadsafe manner. Unlike with other synchronization primitives, mutable variables wrapped in an `Atomic&lt;T&gt;` wrapper are much harder to accidentally alter in an unsafe way.
* Almost all operations are ""lock-free"", resulting in high-scalability for almost any contention level and any number of threads; with a suite of [benchmarks](https://github.com/Egodystonic/Atomics/tree/master/Egodystonic.Atomics.Benchmarks) used to measure performance and guide implementation.
* A full suite of [unit tests](https://github.com/Egodystonic/Atomics/tree/master/Egodystonic.Atomics.Tests) with a custom-built harness for testing the entire library with multiple concurrent threads.
* Support for custom equality (e.g. compare-and-swap with two `IEquatable&lt;&gt;` objects will use their `Equals()` function for comparison).
* Library is targeted to .NET Standard 2.0 which is [supported by most modern .NET platforms](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions.md).
* MIT licensed.


## Library Advantages

Although the best design for threadsafe code is to have no mutable state at all, sometimes it is a necessity for performance or reasons of complexity.

As [growth in single-core computing power is slowing](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601441/moores-law-is-dead-now-what/), scaling via parallelism with higher CPU core counts is becoming an increasingly important way to increase application responsiveness. The latest generation of desktop CPUs have more threads than ever before, with the flagship specs currently being Intel's i9 9900k (16 threads) and AMD's Threadripper 2950X (32 threads).

Currently the .NET FCL/BCL offers a great suite of tools for writing parellized/concurrent code with `async/await`, concurrent &amp; immutable collections, `Task`s and the TPL, and more fundamental constructs like locks, semaphores, reader-writer locks, and more. 

However, one potentially missing element is the provision for threadsafe single variables, often used as part of a larger concurrent algorithm or data structure. Many other languages provide a similar library, including [C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic), [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/atomicvars.html), [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/atomics.html), and [Go](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/).

Some examples:

	readonly AtomicVal&lt;Matrix4x4&gt; _atomicMatrix = new AtomicVal&lt;Matrix4x4&gt;();

	public void SetUpScene() {
		// Transpose the matrix if it isn't already the identity matrix; and return the previous value all as an atomic op
		var exchResult = _atomicMatrix.TryExchange(m =&gt; m.Transpose(), (current, next) =&gt; !current.IsIdentity);

		if (exchResult.ValueWasSet) {
			// If we transposed it, recalculate our scene positions using the previous value
			RecalculatePositions(exchResult.PreviousValue);
		}

		// Apply the frustum culling using the current value
		ApplyCameraFrustum(exchResult.CurrentValue);
	}

...

	readonly AtomicLong _index = new AtomicLong();

	public void ReduceIndex() {
		// Halve the current index value if it's at least 100 as an atomic op
		_index.TryMinimumExchange(i =&gt; i / 2, 100);
	}

...

	readonly AtomicRef&lt;User&gt; _sessionUser = new AtomicRef&lt;User&gt;(new User(""Xenoprimate"", 45067));

	public void ChangeUserName(string newUsername) {
		// Atomically swap the _sessionUser for a new User object with the new username and same ID; then print out the old name
		var previousName = _sessionUser.Exchange(u =&gt; new User(newUsername, u.ID)).PreviousValue.Name;

		Console.WriteLine($""Session user '{previousName}' has changed name to {newUsername}."");
	}

Java is also a standard in many applications designs as well. For dynamic coding and to have motion in action, Java is the preferred language. When it comes to Python, much of the server-side coding and the new web frameworks being launched work off python. Developers need to code in the right amount of code to develop Python, as it is a conservative language. Developers need to use less to describe more. This makes Python increasingly in-demand. Additionally, due to its popularity and versatility, Python is used across developing complex applications that leverage its capabilities.

It's quite unreasonable if that's the case. We should not have to pay Oracle to use a service we already are paying for. If anything the vendor should handle the licencing on their end.

An email is sent to the user to verify their email address. The back-end is written using Java/Springboot the applications handles the sending and generation of the email using Thymeleaf.

**Challenge**

We have been asked to create a second emailer that is a reminder to the user that if they want to login they must verify their email address, which is triggered if the user doesnt verify their email address within 24 hours. I.T has decided that they are going to give this job to a person that works in operations rather than a developer. So the person in operations is going to write a shell script to generate the email and send the email. Which includes pulling the users name, email address, unique registration URL and so on from the Database on production amongst other things. I think this is a terrible idea having a shell script running concurrently with our Java application. Ive been told that it isn't a problem and I am putting to much emphasis on the impact that it might have and that the reason this was done is because we don't want it to be developer work as the developers are under pressure.

Am I wrong? Is this how IT departments and applications are usually run? I feel like the impact will outweigh the quick win in the long run and will result in more work being done anyway. Any opinions on this would be appreciated.

R and Python are the most popular programming languages used by data analysts and data scientists. Both are free and open source and were developed in the early 1990s—R for statistical analysis and Python as a general-purpose programming language.

In the first, I will cover the vital aspect of python language after that covers important aspect in R language.

**About Python:**

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language.

Python programming language has been created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.

&amp;#x200B;

**Benefits of Python include:**

It is open source, freely available, and quite stable.

Python is a simple, minimalistic and straightforward language. Reading a good Python program feels almost like reading English and it is so easy to work with and understand.

Python is easy to learn, although you are not a trained, programmer. You can begin working with the Python language; it just takes a bit of patience and a lot of practice.

The Python resource library is one of the best among programming languages.

[Python](https://www.learntek.org/python-training-online/) allows scaling even the most complex applications with ease.

In data mining, big data and automation platforms are depend on Python. It is the perfect language to work with for general purpose tasks.

Python is used for a more productive coding environment than massive languages like C# and Java. Experienced coders tend to stay more organized and productive when working with Python, as well.

Python provides us a Django, which is an open source web application framework. These frameworks – like [Ruby on Rails](https://www.learntek.org/ruby-on-rails/) – can be used to simplify the development process.

It has a massive support base thanks to the fact that it is open source and community developed. Millions of like-minded developers work with the language on a daily basis and continue to improve core functionality. The latest version of Python continues to receive enhancements and updates as time progresses. This is a great way to network with other developers.

&amp;#x200B;

The main reasons why Python is mainly used in the research and scientific  communities is because of its ease of use and simple syntax which makes it easy to adapt for the people who have an non-engineering background. It is also more suited for quick prototyping. Another reason that could explain the popularity of Python is that most online courses on data science and machine learning as pushing Python because it is easy to use for beginners.

[**Learn python + Advanced Python Training**](https://www.learntek.org/python-training-online/)

Ease of Libraries: Python comes with many inbuilt libraries for data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Some of the most popular libraries are Pandas (for Data Science), Pytorch, TensorFlow (high-level neural network library for deep learning), scikit-learn (for data mining, data analysis and machine learning), matplotlib, seaborn, scikit (data visualization), etc. Thanks to Python’s popularity, there are numerous resources — machine learning and data science tutorials — out there where Python libraries are utilized. Plenty of tutorials are readily available online as well.

Many times, researchers build their own libraries and upload them on GitHub or similar platforms so that others can use them. The developer community support and a plethora of features are what make Python suitable for machine learning applications. On the other hand, Java was mostly built for general programming, not number crunching, a field where R and Python are more preferred.

Python provides us ready made library (Packages) to perform the various operation on data. With a single line of code, you can do the different complex operation on data. If you use the java, then you will have to write lines of code to perform the specific task, whereas in python we can call the inbuilt function. Python is a compelling programming language used for many different applications. Over time, the massive community around this open source language has created quite a few tools to effectively work with Python. In recent years, many tools have been built specifically for data science. As a result, analyzing data with Python has never been easier.

For data science, python provides us with robust library packages such as Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib. Pandas is one of the vital Library in python to do data analysis. It used for everything from importing data from Excel spreadsheets to processing sets for time-series analysis. Pandas put pretty much every common data munging tool at your fingertips. Pandas is built on top of NumPy, one of the earliest libraries behind Python’s data science success story. NumPy’s functions are exposed in Pandas for advanced numeric analysis.

Python provides us another important library called as SciPy which is the scientific equivalent of NumPy, offering tools and techniques for analysis of experimental data.

Apart from this python provide us following libraries to focuses on tools for statistical analysis.

Scilkit-Learn and PyBrain are machine learning libraries that provide modules for building neural networks and data pre-processing.

SymPy – for statistical applications

Shogun, PyLearn2 and PyMC – for machine learning

Bokeh, d3py, ggplot, matplotlib, Plotly, prettyplotlib, and seaborn – for plotting and visualization

csvkit, PyTables, SQLite3 – for storage and data formatting

**Drawbacks of Python**

* Python is slower in contrast with available programming languages as it is an interpreted language.
* Python requires rigorous testing as the errors show up in runtime.
* Python programming is still considered weak on mobile computing platforms as there are few apps created with Python as a core language.
* Python is not a very good language for mobile development.
* Python is not a good choice for memory intensive tasks.

**About R Language**

Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman were invented at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. This programming language was named R, based on the first letter of the first name of the two R authors (Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka)

&amp;#x200B;

  As of December 2018, R ranks 16th in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages.

R is open-source software. Hence anyone can use it.

The [R language](https://www.learntek.org/analytics-using-r-programming/) is popularly used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Command line interface is provided by R, also, several graphical user interfaces, such as RStudio is also available.

R is an interpreted language; users typically access it through a command-line interpreter.

R language has various statistical features including linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and others.

The strong variety of library makes R the first choice for statistical analysis, especially for specific analytical work. Also, one of the standout features of using R is you can create beautiful data visualization reports and communicate the findings.

**Benefits of R include:**

R is mainly used for statistical analysis.

The most significant advantages of this tool are the fact that it is fully open source that is it can be downloaded very quickly and is free of cost.

R is a programming language, mainly dealing with the statistical computation of data and graphical representations.

Like most other programs, R programs explicitly document the steps of your analysis and make it easy to reproduce and/or update analysis, which means you can quickly try many ideas and/or correct issues.

[**Learn Analytics using R Programming Training**](https://www.learntek.org/analytics-using-r-programming/)

R is a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

R can communicate with the other language. It is possible to call Python, Java, C++ in R. The world of big data is also accessible to R. You can connect R with different databases like Spark or Hadoop.

R provides an extensive, coherent and integrated collection of tools for data analysis.

R has special Packages for programmers

* dplyr, plyr, and data table is used for data manipulation
* stringr is used to manipulate strings
* zoo package is used to work with regular and irregular time series
* packages such as ggvis, lattice, and ggplot2 used for data visualization
* caret package for machine learning

**Drawbacks of R:**

* The users with no programming skill, R language will be a little tricky.
* It is not used in application development.
* R commands give little thought to memory management, and so R can consume all available memory.

**Python vs. R ?**

The choice between R and Python totally depends on your level of interest, knowledge and objective.",Here you get to know the difference between Python Vs R

I don’t know like anything about java or programming, would it be like a beginner project?"
2932,2019-03-15 15:57:39,1,1,"So recently I have been spending a lot of time in C and C++. I think my code style is probably very poor. For the most part I think that I do okay at proper memory management but admittedly there are a lot of things I know that I don't understand properly. I think a large part of that is style.

For the better part of the last decade my focus has been almost entirely in Objective-C. The more I am programming in C++ the more that I realize the differences.

I started objective-c using manual reference counting. One thing I loved about it was that in my mind it helped me understand memory management. Now that I have been working in C++, I realize I don't quite get it completely, though in general I do okay.

Some things I need some clarity on:

1. What is the rule of thumb for allocating pointers, receiving already allocated pointers, and who has the job of freeing memory when? To contrast this with what I am familiar: In Objective-C (NON\_ARC) you call retain on an object and it will stick around AT LEAST until you release it. Since there is no ""retain"" in C++, does this mean if I want to be sure the object stays around I must make a copy?
2. It seems weird to me that you can allocated objects on the stack or heap. It could be my understanding of what is going on that is the problem but in Objective-C, EVERY object is a pointer and allocated on the heap, whereas in C++ I can do it both ways and I am not sure why or what I might not understand about the reasoning behind this:

&amp;#x200B;

    Object foo = Object();
    //or
    Object *bar = new Object();

3. ​ What is the relationship between **&amp;thing** and **Thing&amp;**? Is there one? I understand that &amp;thing is getting a pointer(pointer reference?) of a stack-allocated thing, and Thing&amp; is a reference too... something. Could be a pointer, could be a primitive on the stack... could be a reference to the value in a pointer... how do you know which is which and why etc.

4. I've been doing a lot with void\*'s mostly because of low level communication stuff with BLE. I've been writing my code in a way that I think is probably not ""kosher"" but works. For example:

&amp;#x200B;

    void onWrite(BLECharacteristic* characteristic){
        if(characteristic == dataStreamCharacteristic){
            char* data = dataStreamCharacteristic.value().c_str();
            uint8_t preamble = (uint8_t)*data;
            if(preamble == kAUDIO_STREAM_PREAMBLE){
                uint8_t* 8bitAudioStream = (uint8_t*)data + 1;
                size_t streamLen = dataStreamCharacteristic.value().length() - 1;
                m_totalBytesReceived += streamLen;
                memcpy(completeAudioData + m_totalBytesReceived, 8bitAudioStream, streamLen);
            }
        }
    }

5. I notice often that what I think will happen is not what actually happens and I don't always get why. 2 examples come to mind that I don't thing are very related except that I know that I don't know what exactly is going on and why.

First Example:

(I am definitely not an android programmer but was trying to help out here) In passing data from java/kotlin to a method in the Android NDK I noticed the following:

    Java_com_socketwithc_MainActivity_stringFromJNI(JNIEnv *env, jobject /* this */, jstring pass, jbyteArray sha256) {
        (sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0));
        jboolean isCopy;
        jbyte* shaw = env-&gt;GetByteArrayElements(sha256, &amp;isCopy);// this is the JNIbyte, typedef as int8
        uint8_t realHash[32] = {0xC8 ,0xF0 ,0x15 ,0x94 ,0x78 ,0xF4 ,0x21 ,0xAF ,0x5F ,0x09 ,0x97 ,0x7D ,0x86 ,0x9A ,0x4C ,0x53 ,0x24 ,0xAB ,0xBF ,0x57 ,0x7A ,0xB3 ,0xBE ,0x77 ,0xC6 ,0x05 ,0xA4 ,0xE1 ,0x08 ,0x4D ,0x08 ,0xEC};
    
        //Here I try to send the login command with the jbyte* shaw
        bool suc = loginMobile(mobileSocks.ipv4, shaw); // This FAILS. I don't understand why? in memory
                                                         //is this not the same hex value no matter the                 
                                                        //type?
        //So I copy the values to a uint8_t array (uint8_t*)
        uint8_t copyHash[32];
    
        //copy in a slow way that ensures the values are correct...
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 32; i++){
            copyHash[i] = shaw[i];
            assert(copyHash[i] == realHash[i]);
        }
        bool suc = loginMobile(mobileSocks.ipv4, copyHash); //This SUCCEEDS, BUT it seems like the exact
                                                             //same data.
    }

Second example:

I was writing some code on the ESP32 using Arduino Core. I created a convenience method that took in a value but something was wrong with what I did:

&amp;#x200B;

    void someFunction(){

Name Search

Write a program that reads in the contents of the two files named GirlNames.txt and BoyNames.txt into two separate ArrayLists.  The information in the files is described as follows:

* GirlNames.txt – This file contains a list of the 200 most popular names given the girls born in the United States for the years 2000 through 2009.
* BoyNames.txt – This file contains a list of the 200 most popular names given the boys born in the United States for the years 2000 through 2009.

The program should allow the user to enter a name.  The program will then look up in the list of girl names to find the name and look up in the list of boy names to find the name.  A message will be printed out indicating one of the four outcomes:

* Girl name found.
* Boy name found.
* Name found in both boy and girl names.
* Name not found.

The application should loop until the user enters a value such as “quit” to terminate.  You have full discretion about how the output should be formatted.

Code as of now:

&amp;#x200B;

import [java.io](https://java.io).\*;

import java.io.FileNotFoundException;

import java.util.\*;

2955,2019-03-27 21:00:25,3,1,"Recently, in the Android app I develop at work, I implemented a `matches` function inside an enum class, `SomeObject`, that takes a `vararg` of the same type and returns a boolean whether or not one of the supplied arguments equals the receiving instance of that class:  

```
fun matches(vararg objs: SomeObject): Boolean {
    for(obj in objs) {
        if(equals(obj))
            return true
    }

    return false
}
```

I then decided that I wanted to genericize this as an extension function so that it can be called on a class of any type, like so:

```
fun &lt;T: Any&gt; T.matches(vararg objs: T): Boolean {
    for(obj in objs) {
        if(this.equals(obj))
            return true
    }

    return false
}
```

In order to preserve compatibility with our Java code that was calling `someObject.matches()`, I then changed the prior implementation of the function inside `SomeObject` to alias the generic implementation:

```
import com.some.app.ext.matches

fun matches(vararg objs: SomeObject) = matches(objs)
```

However, this caused some unit tests that were previously working to fail when calling `someObject.matches()`.  While stepping through the generic `matches` function with the debugger, I noticed something interesting: `objs` was of the type `java.io.Serializable[]`, not `com.some.app.SomeObject[]`.  The `objs` array contained only one element: the array of `SomeObjects` that I was expecting.  Because the extension function was trying to iterate through this array of `Serializable`s, then checking to see if the element inside was equal to a `SomeObject`, it would always return false since the element was always of type `SomeObject[]`.

In Java, my understanding is that varargs map 1:1 to arrays, so `SomeObject... objs` would always map to a `SomeObject[]`.  I assumed this was the case in Kotlin, but I'm confused as to why the varargs woudld be serialized and wrapped inside a one-element array instead.

During the book I was basically taught anytime you call keyboard.findWithinHorizon("" .

In this program after the IF statement runs there is another call for input from the keyboard. Instead of the program pausing and waiting for the user to type in another character followed by enter the program pulls the next character that was typed from the initial scanner call. 

I just don't understand why the call to the second scanner method pulls the next character from the initial scanner assignment instead of the program pausing and waiting for the user to put in another character. I thought findwithinhorizon could only be used to take a single character input at a time given the ("" . "" , 0)[char.At](https://char.At)(0) parameters.

2980,2019-04-04 06:23:12,16,3,"I switched from Eclipse to Intellij a few years ago; mainly for practical reasons like actually being able to import a gradle/spring boot project which over the years got more and more tedious with Eclipse. 

Last year I became a Kotlin developer as well and I love the language. But I continue to have a love hate relation ship with intellij. One thing I miss in particular is stupendously fast incremental compilation that Eclipse used to have for Java which I've never seen even approximated in intellij it's off by 10-100x even under good circumstances when it at least manages to take less than 5 seconds..

Kotlin seems to have made things worse in terms of performance. I'm now commonly faced with half to full minute delays compiling stuff after trivial 1 line changes; worse sometimes. And yes, I have incremental compilation, etc. all turned on as recommended in the countless stackoverflow articles, etc. on this topic.  It should be fast. It clearly isn't . Not even close. And it is clearly re-doing a lot of things over and over again. It looks like it really is the Kotlin compiler that is sucking up all the cpu and not other stuff like java compilation (also not fast) or moving class files around. Worse, it constantly gets it wrong as well and I'm constantly dealing with Intellij lying about whether things compile or not (both). And when it takes a minute for the red squiggly lines to even show up, things get really annoying.

The last time I tried the Kotlin plugin for Eclipse (last summer), was a complete fail. My gradle project didn't import correctly and basically nothing worked. As this was a very simple bog standard gradle/kotlin project, my conclusion was that this is not a usable IDE anymore. I just checked the github project for the kotlin plugin and it still recommends Eclipse Oxygen as the current version (it's from 2017). That does not give me a lot of confidence.

So my question is what the state is of Kotlin in other IDEs. Is Netbeans still a thing? Is there other stuff that people are using?  Just curious at this point.

Recently I've been getting into web development and have tried multiple languages and frameworks. I've tried Rails because of its ""magical qualities"" and I've tried the Spring framework because of my past java programming experience. I didn't like the lack of transparency in Ruby on Rails and the Spring framework began to take the fun out of the programming experience for me. Additionally, as a young developer, I am interested in startup jobs and jobs at tech companies, not backend development jobs at large companies. 

My search has taken me to Javascript, specifically Node.js and React due to the startup job market in NYC. I've been researching for a few days now and the web of Javascript questions has been expanding for every new library I look into. 

**For Example:**

\-When I research Node.js I see people talking about how Next.js is the future and how you need to use Express.js, then the website for Express.js mentions 15 different frameworks.

\-I look at classes on Udamy and the top classes have names like ""The modern approach to web development using react and redux"".

\-Articles talk about how React native is the most in demand skills because it can be shared across devices, but whats the difference between React native and React.js

\-Deeper research brings up articles talking about how firebase or flutter are going to render all native development obsolete

\-I was under the impression that React was for the front end however the Example on React's website say's react is all you need for a full application.

\-Conflicting articles about what skills you should learn before React

\-People speaking wonders about TypeScript, what is TypeScript?

\-How do I choose a database? (is Redux a database? What is MongoDB? why wouldn't I use PostgreSQL?

**My Background:**

I have 2 years of Java programming experience, HTML, CSS, some web development experience

I am too confused to know where to start learning to the point where reading articles about ""choosing the right JS libraries for you"" are confusing me even more.

-its not difficult to learn and/or kind of similar to Java
-its a good choice to create mobile apps
-its a good choice to create desktop GUI applications
-has a relatively bit/active community
-if possible better than java (performance/code length/... improvements)
-its as Cross-Platform as possible

I'm a security professional and part of a large single sign-on (SSO) effort. As part of my job, I work with a lot of application developers who use various languages  (java, C#, .net, etc.) that are attempting to use our SSO solution.  I’ve noticed that these developers sometimes spend days or weeks trying to get over the hurdle of connecting with TLS, getting a certificate, loading their certificate, get a proper trust chain set up and many other challenges with security protocols and technology. This hurts everyone as it squeezes down the integration window adding more pressure.

We've got support playbooks out there, but they are specific to how things work after you’re connected and communicating. It's got me thinking there is a need for some guides or training geared specifically for the developer to help get over the security configuration hurdles and on to real coding for implementing the actual business logic.

I was quite shocked to see my teacher implement multiple main methods in the example project. I was also surprised that we can't implement static classes when they're not nested. 

Perhaps I misunderstood the entire concepts of Java going into the course but I somehow can't wrap my head around how the classname.java files work as a ""concept"" compared to C# where I just compile the project to an exe file and the main method is the insertion point. 

Few additional questions:

1. Do I understand it correctly that I run the class or rather .java file in the IDE instead of my entire project (say like in C# via visual studio)?
2. Is that why I can't implement static classes if not nested?
3. How does this relate to projects? I mean in C# I just develop the application or service as a whole, but how do Java projects work in that regard?

I'm ending my year as a *Computer Science - Game Design &amp; Development* freshmen I want to make some games that use a console window, ASCII characters (maybe Unicode too but not necessary) and ANSI colors like the old games like *Rogue*, *Dwarf Fortress*, etc. I learned C++ before Java and remember using the console and being able to set colors and whatnot. I'm pretty sure java will be a little different there. But, one thing I remember was never to use the System function to clear the screen and that printing a 2D array of characters was slow enough for it to clicker.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be able to print colored text on the screen, take keyboard input like arrows, and be able to type strings in like a console. I also want to be able to have animations where the game loop refreshes the screen time-based (for things like moving enemies) instead of always after user input.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm using adobe illustrator to created production worksheets for garment designs, and currently manually save out all the files i need, which is super time consuming. Adobe illustrator accepts Java script and will automate certain things, but I'm in way over my head with this stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

OK so my file structure looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

Customer X

\-&gt; Designs

\-&gt;-&gt; REF123\_TshirtX

\-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Ref123\_TshirtX.AI (My Master File)

\-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Ref123\_TshirtX\_ProductionWorksheet.PDF (Contains all info on making Garment)

\-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Ref123\_TshirtX\_FrontView.JPG (Front view for online image)

\-&gt;-&gt;-&gt; Ref123\_TshirtX\_BackView.JPG (rear view for online image)

&amp;#x200B;

So my Master file is set up that I have one large art board that contains a front/back view plus other text info on what colors and materials to use. Then 2 smaller art boards inside that one, one that's looped around the front view, and one that looped around the rear view.

&amp;#x200B;

So current I duplicate a master file, create my design, save out art board 1 as a PDF called X\_ProductionWorksheet, save out art board 2 as a JPG as X\_FrontView, save out artboard 3 as a JPG as X\_BackView.

&amp;#x200B;

Having to create sometimes 30 designs per day, saving and re-naming takes up so much of my day, if i could automate it that would make my life so much easier. I essentially want to be able to copy/paste a template folder, re-name it as Customer Y, open the illustrator contained within it, Create a deign, then hit my magic java script button and it will do the following.

&amp;#x200B;

Save the master file thats open (over itself)

Save a PDF version of artbaord 1 with suffex \_ProductionWorksheet (if one exists, save over it)

Save a JPG version of artboard 2 with suffex \_FrontView (if one exists, save over it)

Save a JPG version of artboard 2 with suffex \_BackView (if one exists, save over it)

&amp;#x200B;

Its essentially a self export/update button

&amp;#x200B;

This also means if i ever need to change a master file, i can just hit this and it will update all the other files attached with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to do this via Actions within illustrator, however the file structure will always remember the original file location and save into that. For instance if i create Customer X and create my self saving Action, then duplicate that and call it Customer Y, it will still save into Customer X's file system. When i need it to save the files wherever the master file im in is stored. Actions are fairly limited in terms of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this all makes sense, Any kind of help is appreciated, I'm in way over my head

If I only build the GPIO stuff and call it via CLI on the RPi, everything is OK. If I build the whole application on a PC with a mock GPIO-controller class, everything is OK when running via VS Code. Then, when I try to get the whole application running on the RPi, all hell breaks loose. headmelted's build of VSC hangs since the RPi is too slow (btw, should it be that slow? I'm using a Pi 3 B+) but that's not a problem since I'm using Maven and that's universal, right? Except it isn't, apparently VS Code runs some strange command I don't get to know, and running \`mvn package\` then executing the resulting JAR does not resolve dependencies and results in \`ClassNotFoundException\`s, using \`mvnexec\` from a GitHub repo  works and runs but then Maven expects resources (fxml and input/output files) to be in some other directory I don't get to know, and of course fxml files don't go in the same directory as other resources so the GUI works but then the input file doesn't get parsed!

then i was asked a question about what would happen in if you print console.log  3 times and then use set timeout(0) on the 3 console.log , never even knew set timeout(0) was even possible.  After that i was asked some other weird questions about event loop and scoping. I had a a general answer to the questions , but i didn't want to give a an answer i wasnt 100% sure about.

The hardest part came when i had to do the coding challenge. Ive done plenty of coding challenges at home ,but coding under pressure and coding on your pc are completely different things. During my semester i learned about hash maps , stacks and other data strucutes  and algorithms in java  , so I spent all my time doing data strucutres and algorithm questions because  i was assuming that i would be asked this on an inteveiw , but instead I was asked some strange question that involved using callbacks. I was familiar with callbacks ,but never actually worte any code using them.  i had to create a new function that runs only after function 1 has been executed a certain number of times. I tried to come up with quick solution but under pressure it was hard so i wrote a bunch of bs code , and completly embarrased myself.  I knew they had more questions but seeing how poorly i did on the very first question they just said ""thank you for your time ,   that would be alll for now ""  , that is when i knew for sure that i failed.

In short, the **JSONx Framework** provides:
1) JSON Schema Definition Language (JSD), for Consumer Driven Contracts, for instance.
2) A Java API for binding to JSDs, implemented with annotations to be light-coupling.
3) A JSD-&gt;Java binding generator, and a Java-&gt;JSD reverse generator.
4) A `jsonx-maven-plugin`, for generating binding classes during the `generate-sources` phase, for instance.
5) A JAX-RS provider for `MessageBodyReader` and `MessageBodyWriter`, to plug into a JAX-RS runtime.
6) A sample project called: ""Consumer Driven Contracts"".

I´currently try to setup a basic TornadoFX Application using IntelliJ IDE.  


After various error messages and build errors, I noticed there seems currently no support/many issues with OpenJDK11 so I installed OpenJDK1.8 and used this one for my project setup. Then I added OpenJavaFX (11!!) as a lib because otherwise the app complains about missing ""javafx module"". But now I´m getting the following error:

`java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: javafx/application/Application has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 54.0), this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0)`

Do I have to use Open?JavaFX 8 or what am I missing? According to the error description this might be the solution? Or am I missing something completly? How can I get this work properly?

The teacher that we had for that was great, but at the end of the 2nd week, he tells us that he isn't an expert in Java and that the school was going to be bringing in a new teacher that is an expert at Java. So we were fine with that. The first day the new teacher started, we realized that he was no expert at Java at all. We had some sympathy for him so we gave him a week to see how it went. After the last day of his first week, I contacted (along with 6 other students) one of the people that was in charge of the whole thing. She reassures us that he is a professional and qualified for the position. So we all complained over and over during the 8 week course. About halfway through we learned that he had just graduated from a bootcamp himself, seems very fishy to me at this point. They offered me free tutoring sessions which didn't even cover what we were going over.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanna exercise my brain with some small home project. I am going to use Elm for frontend (I am fairly comfortable in it) and deciding on the backend.

My background is ruby on rails (professionally) and I want to try something else. Preferably with static typing. I wanted to use Haskell first but decided that learning curve would be too great and I just won't be able to actually finish the project (and I tend not to finish projects). Then I thought about Clojure but it's dynamic language :)

What would you recommend in my case? Ideally, I just want someone to point out some framework and just start working with it (the same way you would do with rails) without spending time on kotlin courses and tutorials.

[Learn JDK in NINT](https://i.redd.it/ph6769y57i431.jpg)

While the Open JDK reference webpage for [Java Development Kit](http://nintedu.com/) (JDK) 13 doesn't yet list any new options, a couple of proposals are said to be targeted for the release.

 JDK 13 is due 17th September 2019 following ramp down and unharness candidate stages occurring in coming back months. JDK improvement Proposals eyed for the discharge cover:

* Development a tool for packaging      self contained Java applications known as Jpackage. The tool would      be supported the JavaFX javapackagertool that supports native      packaging formats to offer the user a natural installation expertise.      It permits launch-time parameters to be specified at      packaging time. The tool is invoked directly from the statement or      programmatically via the ToolProvider. Several applications need      to be installed on a native platform in an exceedingly “first-class” approach instead      of being placed on the class path or module path. A      packaging tool can also fill gaps left by technologies like Java web start, which was removed      from Oracle’s JDK 11. The javapackagertool was deleted from      JDK 11 as a part of the removal of JavaFX.
* Enhancing the ZGC (Z Garbage      Collector) to come back unused memory to the OS, a proposal      cited as integrated into [JDK 13](http://nintedu.com/java-j2ee/).      ZGC, that is beaked as a scalable, low-latency      collector, presently doesn't return unused memory back      to the OS even if the memory has not been used in an      extended time. This behavior isn't optimum for a few      applications and environments, particularly those where memory      footprint could be a concern, like containers or      environments wherever an application might be idle      for an extended time and is sharing or competitive for      resources with alternative applications.
* Extending Application Class Data Sharing      (AppCDS) to modify dynamic archiving of classes at the      end of application execution. Archived classes would come      with all loaded application and library classes not present within      the default, base-layer CDS archive. This proposal, which is within      the targeted stage, is meant to enhance the usability      of AppCDS and eliminate the necessity for users to try and      do trial runs to form a category list for every application.

Two capabilities anticipated for JDK 13 are cited antecedently by Mark Reinhold, chief designer of the Java platform cluster at Oracle:

* Raw string literals, which may span      multiple lines of source code and don't interpret,      escape sequences. This capability had been cut from JDK 12, which arrived      in March 2019. The arrangement is to supply raw string      literals solely as an opt-in beta in JDK 13. Its      goal is to form development easier n Java by, for instance, letting developers express      sequences of characters in a readable kind free of Java      indicators, or offer strings targeted for grammars apart      from Java. Following the expected take a look at run in      JDK 13, raw string literals may be created production-quality within      the future JDK 14 unleashes.
* A production version of switch expressions, that [JDK](https://www.google.com/) can provide a beta implementation. The switch statement are extended to be used as either a statement or an expression, thus each may use either a “traditional” or “simplified” scoping and control flow behavior.",The new features coming to Java 13 – JDK 13

VsCode support decent refactoring and intellisense too. The same applied when I need to do Python projects.

 For the validation the isValidShipId method is called with a 10 digit long ship ID. The first nine digits identify the ship. The last digit is a checksum which checks if the identifier digits are correct. This last-digit-checksum is calculated by multiplying the digit number with the digit value. The result is integer divided by 11, the outcoming rest is used as 10th digit. When the rest equals 10, the character X is used instead. Example: A ship with the id 470000013? has the checksum 1\*4 + 2\*7 + 3\*0 + ... + 8\*1 + 9\*3 -&gt; 9

&amp;#x200B;

I have to use the:

Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);

To read the ships ids, am i correct?

Currently I am working on Euler project challenges. I am trying to compare times of functions that are very similar or running the same function multiple times with different parameters. For example one function finds the smallest common multiple (SmallestMultiple())of the range of numbers from 1 to whatever number I use (source code and output below). While trying to compare running this function to 100 and then 200, I noticed that running the function to SmallestMultiple(100) then SmallestMultiple(200) caused SmallestMultiple(200) to be 10 times faster than SmallestMultiple(100) despite being for twice as many numbers. 

I think this is due to caching. Is there a way to either clear the cache or remove compiler optimizations to make sure that running each function call is running fresh without needing to restart the program each time.

   
 

I understand that sometimes the outside factors can cause code to run at different speeds, but this happens consistently. I would like to stop this from happening to make sure that my algorithms are otherwise optimized. I am using IntelliJ IDEA for my IDE. 

   
 

Output (ignore the numbering of the line number) - Notice that the first 100 take 1.7 million nanoseconds and the first 200 takes 300,00 nano seconds despite needing to look at twice as many numbers.

I am a 32 years old, I have tried learning programming plenty of times in the past 10 years and every time it started to get a bit challenging I quit. I could never get past learning how to use loops and a little bit of OOP. I have tried to learn multiple programming languages like C#, PHP,   C++, but failed to get further than the basics. I have been working as an IT support for quite  sometime now and after being unable to find better jobs due to lack of skills and over saturation of IT market I have decided to give coding one final shot. So since past 3 weeks I have been learning Java watching  and practicing from Udemy courses and to my surprise I seem to be able to grasp the basics quite easily this time. Not to mention this is my first time learning Java.

As I have mentioned above I am already 32 years old and time is of the essence for me. My question to you folks is how can I become a professional Java developer in about 1 to 2 years. I have a full time job so I won't be able to put in more than 2 to 3 hours everyday practicing coding and during weekends I can dedicate around 6 hours day coding. I have vowed to abstain from all time consuming non productive activities and use it towards learing Java instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years I used Eclipse and Intellij IDEA quite frequently. Eclipse was always snappy and actually got slower over they years (but picked up again in 2018/2019). IntelliJ IDEA was slow at the beginning but is very snappy now...especially since they drastically improved they way the ""text editor"" works internally.

&amp;#x200B;

However one huge difference still exists that severely influences the development flow. Even for the most simple ""Hello World"" program, IDEA takes noticeable longer then Eclipse to launch it. This effects is much more noticeable on older or mobile (laptop) hardware...but even on my pimped workstation I can still notice it.

&amp;#x200B;

All my hardware has SSD and tons of RAM. Windows/Linux/OSX. All the same. When I tested this back in 2015 it was even worse since I had mostly HDDs.

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit more about the testing: we are just talking about repeatedly launching the ""Hello World"" program. Everything is ""build"" at this point. All the IDE should do is launch the JVM and execute HelloWorld.class. This is no rocket science.

&amp;#x200B;

With Eclipse it feels like the JVM is already up and running and it just executes the code snippet in HelloWorld.class

With IDEA it feels like it is doing something before cold-starting a JVM. It takes too long.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously Eclipse is also cold-starting a JVM. It's just that it is so much faster then IDEA that you have to dream up some explanation.

&amp;#x200B;

I even talked with the IDEA devs a few years ago but they didn't know really what I was talking about. Still, many devs I talk to know this problem and adjust their development style on IDEA so they don't execute code as often.

&amp;#x200B;

Changing IDEA settings does not help. Using the Eclipse compiler in IDEA does not help. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is not some isolated fluke. I am using both IDEAs for almost a decade with different OSses, RAM, HDD/SSD, JVMs, etc. and it is always the same: IDEA is by many magnitudes slower then Eclipse in starting up even the simplest of programs.",Mid 2019 - the only problem with IDEA still exists: program launch time

Groovy has a very slow startup so it makes sense to run a JVM background process that executes Groovy programs. We are talking about a 20x speedup. The Java Class Library and many other classes refering to Groovy are already loaded...executing your program is very fast.

&amp;#x200B;

Why is this not available for Java, Kotlin, etc. ? (I am not a Groovy fan) 

&amp;#x200B;

Or maybe it is and my Google search didn't track it down?

&amp;#x200B;

Gradle (which uses Groovy/Kotlin) also has a ""daemon"" mode to speed up execution significantly. Why is this technology not available for Java too?

## Background

Interface development is the most common scenario in back-end development. It may be a RESTFul interface or a RPC interface. **Interfaces, especially those that are biased towards the business, usually get data from various places and assemble it into the results**

It must be considered that how to **develop high-performance interfaces conveniently and rapidly**

For example, assuming that you need to develop an interface that pulls the integrated data of the

- User's basic information data

- User's blog list data

- User's followers data

when the interface of each data is already existed.

**Interface of user's basic information data**

```java
@Service
public class UserServiceImpl implements UserService {
    @Override
    public User get(Long id) {
   try {Thread.sleep(1000L);} catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        /* mock a user*/
   User user = new User();
        user.setId(id);
        user.setEmail(""lvyahui8@gmail.com"");
        user.setUsername(""lvyahui8"");
        return user;
    }
}
```

**Interface of user's blog list data**

```java
@Service
public class PostServiceImpl implements PostService {
    @Override
    public List&lt;Post&gt; getPosts(Long userId) {
        try { Thread.sleep(1000L); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        Post post = new Post();
        post.setTitle(""spring data aggregate example"");
        post.setContent(""No active profile set, falling back to default profiles"");
        return Collections.singletonList(post);
    }
}
```

**Interface of user's followers data**

```java
@Service
public class FollowServiceImpl implements FollowService {
    @Override
    public List&lt;User&gt; getFollowers(Long userId) {
        try { Thread.sleep(1000L); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        int size = 10;
        List&lt;User&gt; users = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(size);
        for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; size; i++) {
            User user = new User();
            user.setUsername(""name""+i);
            user.setEmail(""email""+i+""@fox.com"");
            user.setId((long) i);
            Users.add(user);
        };
        return users;
    }
}
```

*Note that each method sleeps for 1s to simulate business cost time.*

We need to develop an interface to assemble the data provided by the above three interfaces.

&gt; PS:  Such a scenario is very common at work, and normally we need to assemble the data together. Sometimes you even need to get data from a third party via the network. Of course, you may think, why not use three network requests separately to call the three interfaces?  Actually, considering the client Network performance , the data will be transferred as much as possible in one network request when it is not that big, otherwise the transferring cost time may impact the website display fault. Many apps have a complex home page. In fact, they have only one interface. They get all the data in one network request, which makes it easier to develop client.

## Serial implementation

**Writing an excellent performance interface is not only the technical pursuit of every back-end programmer, but also the basic requirement of the business. In general, in order to ensure better performance, it is often necessary to write more complex code.**

However, sometimes we don't want to spend too much time on it, we will write code for serial calls as below

```java
@Component
public class UserQueryFacade {
    @Autowired
    private FollowService followService;
    @Autowired
    private PostService postService;
    @Autowired
    private UserService userService;
    
    public User getUserData(Long userId) {
        User user = userService.get(userId);
        user.setPosts(postService.getPosts(userId));
        user.setFollowers(followService.getFollowers(userId));
        return user;
    }
}
```

**Obviously, the above code is inefficient, which takes at least 3s to get the result**,.

What's more,  once the data of an interface is used, you need to inject the corresponding service and the recycle using becomes inconvenient.

## Parallel implementation

Some programmers may immediately realize that there is no strong dependency among these data, why not refer to parallel implementation?   In other words,  according to the asynchronous thread +CountDownLatch+Future to realize it, as below

```java
@Component
public class UserQueryFacade {
    @Autowired
    private FollowService followService;
    @Autowired
    private PostService postService;
    @Autowired
    private UserService userService;
    
    public User getUserDataByParallel(Long userId) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
        CountDownLatch countDownLatch = new CountDownLatch(3);
        Future&lt;User&gt; userFuture = executorService.submit(() -&gt; {
            Try{
                Return userService.get(userId);
            }finally {
                countDownLatch.countDown();
            }
        });
        Future&lt;List&lt;Post&gt;&gt; postsFuture = executorService.submit(() -&gt; {
            Try{
                Return postService.getPosts(userId);
            }finally {
                countDownLatch.countDown();
            }
        });
        Future&lt;List&lt;User&gt;&gt; followersFuture = executorService.submit(() -&gt; {
            Try{
                Return followService.getFollowers(userId);
            }finally {
                countDownLatch.countDown();
            }
        });
        countDownLatch.await();
        User user = userFuture.get();
        user.setFollowers(followersFuture.get());
        user.setPosts(postsFuture.get());
        return user;
    }
}
```

The above code changes the serial call to a parallel call, which can greatly improve performance at a limited concurrency level.   Nevertheless, it is obviously too complicated.  It is just like a nightmare if each interface needs such a block of codes for parallel implementation.

## Elegant annotation implementation

People who is familiar with Java know that Java has a very convenient feature, that is Annotation.  It is such a  magic to implement complex functions merely by adding some annotations to the class or method.

With annotations, combined with the idea of Spring's relying on automatic injection, can we automatically parallel and calling interfaces automatically by injecting dependencies  via annotations? The answer is yes.

First of all, we need to define an aggregate interface.  Of course, we can also not define the aggregate class,  and write all codes in the original Service class.

```java
@Component
public class UserAggregate {
    @DataProvider(""userFullData"")
    public User userFullData(@DataConsumer(""user"") User user,
                             @DataConsumer(""posts"") List&lt;Post&gt; posts,
                             @DataConsumer(""followers"") List&lt;User&gt; followers) {
        user.setFollowers(followers);
        user.setPosts(posts);
        return user;
    }
}
```

Notes

- `@DataProvider` indicates that this method is a data provider, the data Id is `userFullData`

- `@DataConsumer` indicates the parameters of this method, need consume data, the data Id are `user`, `posts`, `followers`.

Certainly, the original 3 atomic services,   `User's basic information data`, `User's blog list data` and `User's followers data`, also need to add some annotations respectively.

```java
@Service
public class UserServiceImpl implements UserService {
    @DataProvider(""user"")
    @Override
    public User get(@InvokeParameter(""userId"") Long id) {
```

```java
@Service
public class PostServiceImpl implements PostService {
    @DataProvider(""posts"")
    @Override
    public List&lt;Post&gt; getPosts(@InvokeParameter(""userId"") Long userId) {
```

```java
@Service
public class FollowServiceImpl implements FollowService {
    @DataProvider(""followers"")
    @Override
    public List&lt;User&gt; getFollowers(@InvokeParameter(""userId"") Long userId) {
```

Notes

- `@DataProvider` has the same meaning, indicating that this method is a data provider.
- `@InvokeParameter` indicates that when the method is executed, **manually inputting parameters are required**

**Please note the difference between @InvokeParameter and @DataConsumer. The former requires the user to input parameter manually when the top layer is called while the latter is using framework to analyze the dependencies automatically, call DataProvider asynchronously and inject the result as dependency after obtaining the result.**

Finally, you only need to call a unified Facade interface to input data Id, invoke Parameters, and return value types. **The remaining parallel processing, dependency analysis and injection, will be processed automatically by the framework.**

```java
@Component
public class UserQueryFacade {
    @Autowired
    private DataBeanAggregateQueryFacade dataBeanAggregateQueryFacade;

    public User getUserFinal(Long userId) throws InterruptedException,
    IllegalAccessException, InvocationTargetException {
        return dataBeanAggregateQueryFacade.get(""userFullData"",
                Collections.singletonMap(""userId"", userId), User.class);
    }
}
```

## How to use it in your project

The above functions have been packaged as a Spring Boot Starter and posted to the Maven Central Repository by the author.

You just need to introduce dependencies to your project,

```xml
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;io.github.lvyahui8&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-data-aggregator-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.0.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
```

And declare in which paths scanning annotation in the `application.properties` file.

```properties
# Replace with the package you need to scan the annotations
Io.github.lvyahui8.spring.base-packages=io.github.lvyahui8.spring.example
```

After that, you can use the following annotations and Spring Bean to implement aggregate queries.

- `@DataProvider`
- `@DataConsumer`
- `@InvokeParameter`
- Spring Bean `DataBeanAggregateQueryFacade`

Please note that @DataConsumer and @InvokeParameter can be mixed and used in different parameters of the same method.  All parameters of DataProvider method must have one of them, @DataConsumer or @InvokeParameter.

Project address and  sample code above: &lt;https://github.com/lvyahui8/spring-boot-data-aggregator&gt;

## Features

- **Getting dependencies asynchronously**

  All dependencies defined by `@DataConsumer` will be got asynchronously. The provider method is executed when all the dependencies of the provider method parameters are got .

- **Unlimited nesting**

  Dependencies support deep nesting. The above example has only one layer nesting relationship.

- **Exception handling**

  Currently supports two processing methods: ignore or stop 

  Ignore means that the provider method ignores the exception and returns a null value when it is executed. Stop means that once a provider method throws an exception, it will be thrown up step by step, and stop subsequent processing.

  Exception handling configuration item supports consumer level or global level, and comsumer level is priority to global level

- **Query Cache**

  In one query life cycle of calling the Facade's query method, the result called by DataProvider method may be reused. As long as the method signature and the parameters are consistent, the default method is idempotent, and the cached query result will be used directly.** However, this Not an absolute.  Considering the multi-threading feature, sometimes the cache is not used.

- **Timeout Control** (to be developed)

The query core code could be found in  file `io.github.lvyahui8.spring.aggregate.service.DataBeanAggregateQueryService` . If you are interested, you can go to Github to download it.

Are you looking for an ideal way of learning Java from scratch? There are plenty of [**online Java courses**](https://www.simpliv.com/search/sub-category/java) available as well as number of books offline which can help you to learn Java.  There are many aspiring Java programmers who search for answers to  common questions like:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How to learn Java in easy way?
2. Which is the right path to start learning Java?
3. How to learn Java programming?

These are the types of questions we are addressing today. By the end of this blog, we hope our readers will have better clarity about an ideal way to learn Java from the very beginning.

Information presented in this blog does not have any prerequisites to get the maximum value. Also, by no means, we are saying the framework given below is the only method to learn Java,  with different individuals’ different methods will work. Hence, we recommend our readers to please share their thoughts on what has worked the best for them. This will help the whole community to learn from each other. So, without further ado, let’s dive into the agenda for today.

**Java Introduction**

Java is one of the programming languages developed at Sun Microsystem and released in the year 1995. Java programming language is most widely used object-oriented, class-based,  general-purpose programming language. It is fast, secure and a very reliable programming language. Java is the most preferred programming language by many companies to build software applications such as web applications, gaming software, and android application, etc.

**Evolution of Java programming language**

If one wants to learn Java they must know the reasons behind the creation of Java programming language. The main  reasons behind developing the Java programming language are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. To adapt easily to the changing environments and uses.
2. To bring improvements in the art of programming.

As you learn Java further, you will understand that Java was driven by both these factors in equal proportions.

Java is related to C++, which is developed using the C programming language. Java was influenced by both these two languages as it derives its syntax from C whereas its object-oriented features were influenced by C++.

As we can see the purpose of the invention of every language is to provide the solution to a problem in a much better way than its preceding language, Java is no exception.

**Other major reasons for developing Java are**:

&amp;#x200B;

1. To create a **platform independent language** which can run on any environments irrespective of any platform.
2. It is developed with the concept of “*Write once, run anywhere*”  wherein it enables the programmers to easily execute the programs on different platforms without making any modifications to the source code.

Before we further discuss how to learn Java from scratch, it is better if we take couple of minutes and address few  important questions here.

**Is it easy to learn Java?**

Java has the same learning curve as other programming languages. Some of the reasons why Java has upper hand over  most of the programming languages are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. It is platform independent.
2. It is a class-based object-oriented language which reduces the complexity of the coding.

These factors help the programmer to easily understand the programming concepts. One can learn Java in easy way even  if they don’t have any basic programming language but have a strong desire to learn and understand this wonderful programming language.

**Is Java still in demand?**

Yes, Java is the most established language as most of the software applications are being developed using Java programming language. Java with its unique features and continuous updates is ahead of most of the programming languages.

📷

Java is being used to develop many mobile applications, enterprise software, gaming software, which has resulted in increase in the demand of Java programming language.

Personally, I think the most important standards for many users are CDI, Validation, and JAX-RS (any maybe JPA). However, lately I get the feelings that RIs are becoming framework themselves. For example, if you checkout Jersey documentation, you will see a lot of reference to ""Jersey application"" and you get the impression that it's now a full blown framework just like Spring and not just a runtime for JAX-RS (you can even integer Spring into it). If you look at Weld (CDI RI) documentation you see the same thing (custom APIs). What I'm trying to say is that they both implement the standard APIs but the focus now is on providing custom APIs on top of that. While I don't think there's a problem with that, I do think it kinda defeat the whole point of end users sticking to a standard to make apps portable. So, if I'm going to use Jersey framework (build a ""jersey application"") then why not just go with Spring for its bigger community and long history or any other well established  framework for that matter? either way, you are building non portable app so go with what's popular for the time being.

I was looking at some discussion on JAX-RS 3.x integration with CDI in Microprofile environment (what default scope to use for resources not annotated with scope during bean discovery? CDI says they are @Dependent while JAX-RS says request scope). I don't know a lot about Microprofile but I like the idea of it. However, in that thread, someone from Microprofile said they plan on 1 breaking changes per year (not clear if they are breaking EE standards or Mircoprofile standards). That statement alone makes me want to just avoid MP for good (at the end of the day, I'm not trying to build a broken app per year. I'm trying to build something of value). see the comments near the bottom: https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile/issues/50



So, am I alone thinking standards are gone and we should just adapt to the new world of non portable apps like in JS/.NET world?",Are standards becoming a thing of the past in recent years?

In this post, I will cover 7 basics of Java Programming to help you  start coding in Java Today. Before going ahead, I would recommend you go  through our blog on **How to** **Learn Java** **from Scratch**, which ensures you have a clear learning roadmap in your mind.

I probably don’t need to tell you that without mastering basics in  Java or any programming language, you cannot do coding efficiently.

Whether you are a recent graduate who is looking to learn a major  programming language like Java or an experienced programmer who wants to  increase the potential for future career growth, having a solid  knowledge of basic concepts of Java is must.  Java is an easy  programming language for one who has paid attention to the basics,  however, it can be equally frustrating for one who tries to take the  shortcut.

If any of the above points sounds familiar, I  have a great news: There are 7 basics concepts of Java which can help  you to start coding better right today. You can also find a list of **Java online courses** which will cover these basics concepts and their application in detail. Let’s get started with our discussion….

📷

We will cover **7 Java Coding basics elements** in the following manner:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Basic Program Syntax
2. Variables
3. Datatypes
4. Operators
5. Arrays
6. Loops
7. Conditional Statements

Let’s get started with the first basic. Let us consider a basic sample program in Java, “Hello World” program.

**1)    Basic Program Syntax:**

public class MyfirstJavaProgram {

public static void main (String\[\] args)

{

System.out.println(“Hello World”);

}

}

Let’s see some basic syntax to write this program:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Case sensitivity:** Java is case sensitive. Here upper case letters and lower case letters are treated completely different.
2. **Class name:** For all class names the first letter  should be in Upper Case.  If several words are used in class name each  inner word should start with upper case letter. For example, in the  above program class name is MyFirstJavaProgram.
3. **Method name:** Each method name should start with a  lower case letter. If more words are included in Method name, then each  word should start with Upper case word. For example, method name: Public  void myMethodName().
4. **System.out.println():** It is used as a print statement. **System** is the class, **out** is the object PrintStream class, **println()** is the method of PrintStream class.

**2)    Variables:** A variable is used  to store the data value. These are associated with data types. There  are different types of variables as discussed below:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Local variable:** A variable is declared inside the body of the method is called as local variables.
2. **Instance variable:** A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called instance variables.
3. **Static variable:** A variable which is declared as  static is called static variable. A static variable cannot be local. It  is not possible to create a single copy of the static variable and share  among all the instances of the class. Memory allocation for static  variable only once when the class is loaded in the memory.

I'm a summer intern at a .NET shop. My first project is to use Azure Search for a private dataset. I'm prototyping my project in C#. 

As an aside, this is my first time playing with a) C#, b) web dev and c) large codebases and libraries. I'm taking a big leap and [feeling a little lost](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/008/342/ihave.jpg). (other advice appreciated)

I'm accustomed to explicit type declaration from school. As I've looked at C# on stackoverflow and library documentation, some examples use *var* for anything and everything. Variables are born *var* and method calls return *var*.

I've been studying Java for a while now and my skills are starting to get pretty solid now and I'm prepared to build some simple projects to upload to GitHub. But every time I see job postings online, they usually ask way more than core Java, even if it's meant for junior developers. I know many of these postings are bullshit and I shouldn't take them too seriously and apply anyway, but since I'm still kind of a beginner, it's a little hard for me to tell which technologies I'd be expected to know. Btw, if it matters, I'm using [Hyperskill.org](https://Hyperskill.org) and Tim Buchalka's [Java Programming Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/) as my main resources.

Of course, if I focused on Java for Android (which was what I wanted to do when I started learning Java), it'd all be much easier to figure out, but unfortunately, for most of the week I only have access to a simple notebook that can't handle Android Studio, so that's a problem. It runs IntelliJ IDEA somewhat allright though, so it leaves me all the other areas where Java is used, but I know way less about them than I know about Android.

1. The recently released Java 13 (non-LTS) has been added to the innovator stage of adoption within our Java and JVM trends graph.
2. Java 11 (LTS release) has moved to early adopter (EA), and Java 8 -- which was marked as end-of-life for commercial use in January 2019 -- has moved to late majority (LM).
3. Non-HotSpot JVM are seeing increased adoption, with OpenJ9 moving to EA, and the addition of Graal to our adoption graph. We believe that the increasing adoption and importance of cloud computing is driving organisations to utilise Java Runtime Environments (JREs) that embrace “cloud-native” principles such as a fast start-up time and a low memory footprint.
4. Graal in itself may not be overly interesting to regular developers, but the ability to compile Java application to native binaries, in combination with the support of polyglot languages, is ensuring that we keep a close watch on this project.
5. There has been a shuffle of Java microservice frameworks, with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud moving into late majority, as these are trusted choices for creating Java microservices within the enterprise. Helidon has joined Microprofile within EA, and we believe that vert.x will not progress past the EA phase, due to it’s relatively niche appeal.
6. Let us know what you think or if we have missed any important trend.

3315,2019-07-16 22:27:19,1,1,"Is there an algorithm for non-negative values (values greater than 0) that takes an int array and an int k as parameters, to count how many subarrays whose sum equals K and return the count? 

The input array can have duplicates but as individual objects, they cannot be used twice or counted twice. The conditions are that the same element cannot be used twice, so every subarray should have a unique element or unique elements, so every object can end in one sub-array.

I have developed several algorithms during the last two months but they did not work for all positive values, I failed to develop one to execute the task correctly. I really appreciate if anyone has such algorithm that can fit this purpose. 


For instance, suppose that k, the target value is 13 and the input array is: {14, 13, 7, 6, 5, 8, 4, 9, 8, 5, 3}

Then the method should return the number of sub-arrays whose sum is equal to k, the target value which in this case is 13. The method should return 5. Since the sub-arrays whose sum is 13 are: {13}, {7,6}, {5,8}, {4,9}, {8,5}. We have two sub-arrays({5,8}) that have the same values but they are not the same objects, so we are good here and have used every unique element once to form a sub-array whose sum is equal to k.

14 is larger than the target so it will be discarded and 3 cannot be grouped with other elements to sum 13 because they all have been used in other subarrays, so 3 will be discarded as well.

Another condition that algorithm should return the highest possible count of sub-arrays whose sum is equal to k. If we have an input array like = {1,2,3,4,5,6} and the k is 10.

It would be wrong if we grouped it like this = {6,3,1} and {5,2,4} because we get just one subarray whose sum is equal to 10. It is wrong because we can group it like this = {6,4} and {5,2,3} and we get the highest possible count of sub-arrays whose sum is 10.

So that is basically it.

I've been looking into java plugins and tools that might help me with drawing diagrams that are parseable. Ideally, I'm looking to draw block diagrams that I could interconnect easily. Flow charts and such are very limiting; I would like to draw a system, for example, that can then be parsed into code.

I've looked into graphivz/dot. It is powerful but I'm rather unsure if that is what I'm looking for.

Also, I don't need an output text that looks like dot's, that resembles the diagram itself. Whatever output a tool can give me, that I can read (as opposed to a PNG, for example), is more that I can ask for. 

Once I have a good drawing basis for block diagrams and such, I can work with the rest.

3392,2019-08-07 19:15:50,15,3,"Hey C# folks,

Asking for some humble advice on how to tackle a rather confusing situation around CI/CD for .Net Core projects.

Today, developers are looking to move to the model of 1 repository with 1 solution file with multiple projects. Each of these projects are distinct deployments such as web, api, and processor. In my mind, this is monolithic, but I am getting strong push back that this is not the case; this is Microsoft best practice. 

My inner DevOps mindset says that each of these projects should be their own separate Git repository (i.e decouple the UI from API tier and processing tier from UI etc) and each project should build independently. When we bring this up however, we seem to get a lot of flack as this causes the need for multiple solutions and causes complexity in local development.

In short, my mindset is: 1 repo is 1 CI Job which is 1 CD job

However, we are being asked to support: 1 repo is ""n"" CI Jobs which is ""n"" CD jobs

How do you trace back changes in the latter? Does anyone have an experience tackling/solving this?

    package main;
    import /*\u002a\u002fjava/**/.
    /*\u002a\u002f awt.Color; public class Main { static void Println(String s) { var f=/**/""fmt"";
    /*\u002a\u002f System.out.println(s); } public static void main(String[] args) {/**/
    var g = ""\u0022+""; func main() { _, _ = j, ""+\u0022"";
    Println(""Hello, world!"");
    g = ""\u0022+"";}; var _=""+\u0022"";
    var j = ""\u0022+""//"";}}

This prints ""Hello, world"" to stdout in both Java and Go. Running this in Java requires Java version 10, and the file must be saved inside a folder called ""main"".

Let's go over it piece by piece and see how it works.

    package main;

A necessity in Go, but for Java this requires that the code be saved in a folder called main. Also, notice how Go's optional semicolons become mandatory when the code might run in Java.

    import /*\u002a\u002fjava/**/.

The supreme quirk of Java that makes this polyglot possible is that Unicode escape sequences like `\u002a` are substituted first in the compilation, *before* the lexer begins. Go interprets `/*\u002a\u002f` as just a continuing comment, but Java expands the two escape sequences to `*/`. Therefore, it sees this line as ""`import java.`"" interspersed with comments. Go, meanwhile, sees nothing inside the comment and sees only `import .` — thus setting up a `.` import to avoid writing the package name.

    /*\u002a\u002f awt.Color; public class Main { static void Println(String s) { var f=/**/""fmt"";

We start another Java-only line, in which we continue the import of the last line by importing awt.Color. (I had to import *something*, and that was the first thing I thought of.) Next, we declare Java's class-opening boilerplate, followed by the beginning of a helper method to give a call to Println the same effect in Java and Go. Now that we're inside a method, we can declare a variable, so we create a variable called `f` that is assigned to the string `fmt`. However, Go sees the `*/` after the assignment as terminating the comment that's been going on the whole line, meaning it sees only `""fmt"";` on this line. Combined with the previous line, Go reads `import . ""fmt""`.

    /*\u002a\u002f System.out.println(s); } public static void main(String[] args) {/**/

Same deal with a comment hidden from Go but not Java as before. This line contains the implementation of `Println` as continued from the previous line, plus the beginning of Java's `main` function. Go sees nothing on this line.

    var g = ""\u0022+""; func main() { _, _ = j, ""+\u0022"";

This is Go's opening boilerplate, using a slightly different method to hide it from Java. Java parses the `\u0022` into a `""` and sees `var g = """" + ""...""` (empty string + long string). Go doesn't and assigns `g` the value `""+`, then reads the rest of the line as code. On the line, we start the main function, assign `j` (declared later on) to the blank variable to prevent an unused variable error, then assign a string to a blank variable to close the Java string as we opened it.

    Println(""Hello, world!"");

In Go, this calls `fmt.Println`, which we can call without writing `fmt.` because of the `import . fmt` statement. In Java, this calls `Main.Println(String)`, which assigns an unused variable `f` the value `fmt` and then calls `System.out.println`.

    g = ""\u0022+"";}; var _=""+\u0022"";

Reuse `g` to save a few characters and prevent an unused variable error. This is Go's closing boilerplate, separate from Java's because Go needs one closing brace while Java needs two. There's probably some way to combine them into one line, but I couldn't figure it out. To repeat, Java reads this line as `g = """" + ""..."" + """";`.

    var j = ""\u0022+""//"";}}

And here is Java's closing boilerplate, using a single-line comment to prevent Go from seeing the two closing braces. Java reads `var j = """" + ""//"";}}` while Go reads `var j = """"+""`.

Some further thoughts on polyglot programming in these languages:

* `if` will work perfectly because putting brackets around the condition is valid in Go.
* `switch` will work as long as the cases are all constant integers and you put `break;` at the end of every case. Fallthrough appears impossible, because the Go spec says fallthrough ""may be used only as the final non-empty statement in such a clause.""
* Three-condition `for` loops are available, but having to hide the brackets from Go makes them awkward: `var i = 0; for /*\u002a\u002f ( /**/ i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++ /*\u002a\u002f ) /**/ {`
* You can omit the initialization and increment for a while-loop, and use `true` in place of the condition for a permanent loop.
* `for range` loops are not possible. The syntax is too different.
* Functions are painfully verbose. The different declaration syntax means you have to declare both signatures hidden from each other. Here's a polyglot function to add two numbers together. `/*\u002a\u002f public int add(a int, b int) {/**/var s=""\u0022+""; func add(a, b int) int { s=""+\u0022""; return a + b; }`",I wrote a Java 10 / Golang polyglot!

Apparently all of this overhead takes a long time.

However, isn't java the same? E.g., java source code has to be compiled into java byte code by the JVM and then java byte code is transformed by C into machine code to execute in the CPU.

Given that both use a VM and have the overhead of interpreting byte code, why would Java be much faster than CPython, specifically at CPU-bound tight loops not implemented in a Python C Extension? 

The common answer to this is that Java has JIT which means all the overhead of the source code-&gt;byte code&gt;machine code goes away.

If this is true, why doesn't CPython have JIT? Is there some technical reason that makes it difficult to implement JIT in CPython, or otherwise makes JIT in CPython not work as well as JIT in Java?

I think years back there was a more advanced ""Developer"" certification which required some code submission, but that doesn't seem to be the case for this one so I think it's probably equivalent to ""Programmer II"" and if I take the upgrade exam I would get a certificate that says ""Oracle Certified Professional, Java SE 11 Programmer"" or something.

3487,2019-09-12 22:23:29,2,0,"question : 

  

1) Consider the following C program. #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char\* argv\[\])

{

printf(""%s %s %s\\n"", \*argv, (\*(argv+1)) + 2, \*(argv+2)); return 0;

}

If this code is executed using the following line, what will be the output?

notes I have gathered so far:

  

argc    – Number of arguments in the command line including program name  
argv\[\]   – This is carrying all the arguments

%c format specifier is used whenever we want to specific that the variable that we are going to print or scan is of type char

%s format specifier is used to specify to the printf or scanf functions that contents of the address that is specified as the next parameter are to considered as string, i.e, a homogenous collection of characters that is terminated by the null character '/0'.

 this program counts the no of alphabet  
 output  
 3 6 5  
 explanation  
 3 is for no for abc  
 6 is obtained as it adds one more character to abc and add 2  
 5 is obtained as it add 2 to output

*Preamble: I am a computer science student and I know that there's a lot that I have no clue about yet. Corrections on any statement that I make are very much welcome.*

&amp;#x200B;

**With that out of the way, I'd like to get to the meat:**

Lately I felt the need to estimate the Memory consumption of my Java applications running in containerized environments:

\- I want to specifically discover a lower bound of memory that I will require on the system to run my apps in a stable manner. 

\- I hope to get a deeper understanding of how the App behaves under load, and what memory I would have to set aside in order to ensure stability while also making maximum use of the resources. (moar containers!)

\- Unlike the usual profiling use-case, which I believe is discovering bottlenecks, memory leaks and alike - my main goal is to just give the App the Memory that it needs for usual day to day usage. (but taking a look at /

I want to do this specifically for an embedded device (with a Yocto style mininal system), thus the memory constraint.

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Takeaways from my preliminary reading:

1) Apparently a lot of profiling applications suffer under plenty of somewhat qualitatively problematic issues (for example: attributing current memory consumption to the instruction in the programm counter - to my understanding this usually biases the results, cause it attributes the consumption to the wrong instruction. Writing in an oop language makes this even worse, as I cannot rely on the hotspot lying even in the proximity of the attributed instruction).

As far as I understood, a fair bit of java profilers will only try to profile when all threads are at a ""Safepoint"", which does not reflect the app under load

(main source: [http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.com/2015/12/safepoints.html?\_sm\_au\_=iVV7RFrslN22qmj3](http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.com/2015/12/safepoints.html?_sm_au_=iVV7RFrslN22qmj3))

2) I am aware that recent versions of the JVM (Oracle and OpenJDK at least) have extended container support, amending some of the cGroup related issues (namely the non-cgroup aware /proc/meminfo and friends) that have been plaguing infrastructure-provisioning (afaik it was necessary to define the cgroup outside (for the system to know when it has to kill the process) and inside via environment variables (passing XX:MaxRam and alike to the JVM in the container)). This is great news, as long as one understands the requirements of the application (resource-wise).

**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

I am usually a friend of doing things right - and I am not sure if I'm on the right path. I'm all in for all the pain that this will cause me, but I prefer doing this via another application (profiler), rather than coding the functionality with a framework. So my intention is to treat the app like a blackbox. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Thus the plan:**

\- Use JMC (Mission Control) &amp; JFR (Flight Recorder) to get a better picture of what's happening in my the JVMs inside the container.

\- Simulate realistic workload on the app in the meantime to generate some meaningful data (note sure how, but I guess that's purely my own issue since it depends on the app in question)

\- Find some way to record the system resources simultaneously, since I will not be seeing enough out of the JVM perspective. (e.g. JVM might throw error when going out of memory (means it is aware) or it might be also just killed by the underlying system running out of memory)

&amp;#x200B;

3526,2019-09-23 15:23:57,4,2,"Hey Guys, i'm currently looking for a library in java which could come in quite handy in a project i'm doing right now.

It is a Spring Boot Server Backend with the function to write/read/delete files. These files are versioned with jgit. However there needs to be the function to write files which are not tracked by jgit (and maybe added later to it).

This creates following problem: What should be done when x users are simultaneously editing a file?
And this is exactly where this library i hope existis comes in:  It should somehow magically solve this problem for me =D

Maybe you might notice, that to some extend this is what git could do for me. However i would be required to add some kind of merge mechanism to the frontend which as of now i am to lazy to do.

   * Google's formatter is too strict; my team has a few indentation and line width tweaks we'd like to make, but \`google-java-format\` doesn't allow for that (except by using the AOSP format for the indentation).
* [https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle)

However, I am still wondering about some things. Firstly will I really be fully limited to Apple environment and eventually a small Linux support? I know that there is a way to compile for windows using an open-source project but I heard that it doesn't support the Foundation library which I guess is a huge step back. For example, I would like to attempt making some libraries using swift which could be used then as a native library file with any language, or even making a cross-platform game with OpenGL (if needed I can compile two versions, one with metal for apple hardware and OpenGL for others), is it attainable?

One thing I haven't figured out yet. In netbeans, when I run an application which contains js/css/html files, and I save those files in Netbeans, I can alt-tab to the browser and ""force refresh"" and my webpage is automatically updated with the js/css/html I just saved. 

How do I get this behaviour in IntelliJ? 

I'm just running a standard java application which uses a very light-weight web framework (sparkjava). If you're not familiar with it, the application is basically packaged like a standard Java ""Jar"" file, it runs using the public-static-void-main method, and then binds to and listens on a port. 

So no fancy web frameworks like tomcat or whatever.

3548,2019-10-01 22:20:02,0,1,"Hey Reddit!

So i am making a java based endpoint using spring to upload some data from a multipart request going from my phone to my PC. I'm trying to make an endpoint that can handle any sized file (assuming space on disk) and will be as efficient as possible. So that backing up files will be easy from my phone to my pc/server

I've tried using a Spring based multipart endpoint and i get a java heap issue and it throws an exception when the file is roughly &gt; 35MB, anything lower than that is fine and things upload smoothly. It shouldn't really be storing it all in heap and should really be writing it in chunks to disk so that i can have as many concurrent files writing as possible.

I was thinking that i could utilize ftp in java (maybe a library for it) and upload that way? Any thoughts?

Thanks in advance :D",Most efficient way to upload data to Spring based endpoint

So the containers are upgraded, the binaries built using java8 are running great on openjdk13 on ubuntu .. in Kubernetes at least. I feel good. This was easy.

I start working on other things.

Few days later my co-worker shows me a weird issue, he likes to work locally using docker-compose, quicker dev cycle sure, built, just run latest built locally, do your testing, remote debugging, whatever.

But the issue was frightening: java.net.UnknownHostException: NOPROXY

What? I google java.net.UnknownHostException: NOPROXY

2 results, neither are relevant.

I start to read the Java13 source code, using my stack trace, nothing explains this.

I tried disabling the new socket API. No luck.

So I dust off my own local docker-compose, I switch IntelliJ over to Java13 JDK although we still develop and build using the good old faithful 8. I start looking into the stacktrace.

Oh great, an actual java bug.

Looks like the code that converts HttpURLConnection to this shiny new HttpClient has issues with proxies. My servers aren't using any, there's no parameter, there are no system proxies. Something in docker-compose on mac is causing confusion.

I scratch my head, I look at the process of filing bug reports, I decide to write this reddit post instead.

Workaround? You have to, in code, preferably your main entrypoint, add this:

ProxySelector.*setDefault*(null);

* waiting: efficiency of a few small tasks with latency, no back pressure
* mixed load: many small tasks and a few large ones interspersed, no latency, no back pressure
* back pressure: many small tasks, with back pressure which may induce latency
* throughput: many small tasks, no latency, no back pressure

The data sources are unsized iterators, and the payloads are scrabble scores (small tasks) and repeated sha-256 hashes (large tasks). Implementations include Conversant, JCTools, Kilim, Quasar, RxJava, the fork join pool, and Java 8 streams.

It's based on Jose Paumard's kata from Devoxx 2015 and David Karnok's (RxJava) refinements. I've been looking for a decent reactive benchmark for a while, and the kata [got mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/cacgmu/choosing_a_reactive_framework_for_the_jvm/et98i03/) in this subreddit a couple months ago so I added in the various conditions and did some  runs on-prem and on AWS. More details in the readme and the full JMH output is available in [the release](https://github.com/nqzero/reactive-bench/releases/tag/jmh-results).

3563,2019-10-07 18:39:38,2,0,"I've tried just about every fix I've seen for this on stackoverflow and for posts on here, but none of them seem to work for this. I either get ""Expected BEGIN\_OBJECT but was BEGIN\_ARRAY"" or ""Expected a com.google.gson.JsonArray but was com.google.gson.JsonObject"".

I use this same data class structure for other sets of data and am able to parse it fine, I'm not entirely sure what is different about this.

Data class:

    data class RadarrData(val tmdbId: Int, val downloaded: Boolean, val title: String, val overview: 
                     String, val year: Int, val genres: List&lt;String&gt;, val ratings: JsonArray)

Function: 

    fun updateMovies() {
    val url = URL(""${Globals.homeIP}${Globals.radarrPort}/api/movie?apikey=${Globals.radarrAPI}"")
    with(url.openConnection() as HttpURLConnection) {
        requestMethod = ""GET""
        val dirtyJson = inputStream.bufferedReader().use {
            it.readText()
        }
        val gson = Gson()
        val test: List&lt;RadarrData&gt; = gson.fromJson(dirtyJson,           Array&lt;RadarrData&gt;::class.java).toList()
        print(test)
    }
}

The first error comes with the line: 

`val test: RadarrData = gson.fromJson(dirtyJson, RadarrData::class.java)`

The second error comes with the line: 

`val test: List&lt;RadarrData&gt; = gson.fromJson(dirtyJson, Array&lt;RadarrData&gt;::class.java).toList()`

&amp;#x200B;

The json data comes in as an array and looks just like the example on the radarr api page (cut to brevity): 

&gt;\[  
&gt;  
&gt;  {  
&gt;  
&gt;""title"": ""Assassin's Creed"",  
&gt;  
&gt;""sortTitle"": ""assassins creed"",

&gt; {  
&gt;  
&gt;""title"": ""Whatever Movie"",  
&gt;  
&gt;""sortTitle"": ""Whatever sorted"",  
&gt;  
&gt;\]

The previous JSON parses I've worked with had something on the outside that allowed me to call it as a JsonArray.

I was trying to use the technic launcher, but it wouldnt load, there would be a little java icon in the task bar at the bottom for like a second and it will close. Fast forward through many reinstalls of both technic and java and heres what I came up with.

The launcher will only load if 32 bit java is installed (jre-8u221 or jre8u221 i586), then I would have to install 64 bit java and then in the launcher switch versions. (my game requires more than the 1gb limit of java 32). Only then could I launch the game. Ok great, so I closed the launcher and tried to re-open it and the same thing happend. Small icon on the task bar and then nothing. Its not like its just hiding in the background I checked task manager as well. So I looked up some stuff and found that maybe I could reconfig inside the java control panel. So i searched it up with both 64 and 32 installed and it wouldnt open. Just like the technic launcher, it would open a small window, then instantly close. Again I tried with just 64 installed, nothing. Then I tried with just 32 installed. And it opened.

 So whats happening here, my pc has run java 64 before and done it fine. I even dug up the old installer and used that version (java 8u 161 i think). That didnt work either. I am at a loss, I have other 64 bit programs, I have high end hardware, all my drivers are up to date (except my uefi but that has not changed since I built this pc). My final thought was maybe it was a capacity issue, because my c drive is getting quite full, I was going to transfer it all off to an external and wipe it because i am recycling it for my new pc. but that wont be for a few more months. Anyways I opted to install java onto my 1tb hard drive instead which had plentyful space. And again, neither technic or the control panel would launch.

I am at a full loss here guys, I am versed in tech, but not in software development, I only know basics. If anyone has anything I could try, I would love a response please and thank you.

Unfortunately, after having to reinstall IDEA, I tried importing my existing course files  but couldn't figure out how to create a run configuration that worked. Anyway, so I'm now trying to run my code on VS Code, and it generally seems to be working, except for one class I have that reads an input text file.

I have the following line of code:

    val inputFile = File(""src/assets/ips.txt"")

The Kotlin file itself is located in `src/coding_challenges`. From what I remember in the course, if the input file isn't in the same folder as the Kotlin file, then `src` becomes your root folder that you work from. This worked fine in IDEA. But I get the following error when I run the code in VS Code:

    Exception in thread ""main"" java.io.FileNotFoundException: src\assets\ips.txt (The system cannot find the path specified)

If I move `ips.txt` to `src/coding_challenges` and change the above line of code to

    val inputFile = File(""ips.txt"")

then everything works fine. The same happens if I create a copy of `ips.txt` in both `src/coding_challenges` and `src/assets` and use

My problem is, if you can call it that, I practice java codeing because of school thus i get a lot of problem solving challenges(tasks/homeworks) int the range of easy to medium-hard(for me really hard) to level up my codeing skill.

My practice session goes like: I sit down in front of my monitor and getting started whit the task: reading the problem. After I read through and sort of understood the tasks and problems I begin to write the code.

I go well with it until I tumble upon some nested loops or really any harder scenes where I can spend like hours figureing out how to do it and what I need to do  in order to get back the right System.out on the console.

[Purified Internet](https://i.redd.it/5s77f28dh1u31.jpg)

Just in praise of Tkinter, which we all need to gratefully remember, is a native part of a standard python distribution.

I used to go the torn route of flask, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, python... before dawning to the mere fact that what really mattered, to me anyway, was my own, however limited, brain.

I came to realize this when I bumped into ""third party issues"" trying to java-request google search results. I slowly got extremely fed up by all the JavaScript bells and whistles: I felt they were just a massive intrusion, of 'vested interests' denying the simple folks a genuine access to internet.

I am a dutiful payer of various on line subscriptions but, still, raping JavaScript usage, by these paid for sites, turns the experience into a real downer: not only flashing popups, laughable cookie warnings, various 'web storage’, and also wanting your email while at it.

They end up forcing you to think according to their java-script layouts. 

So much for the anti-JavaScript rant. I purified my relation with the Internet, using Tkinter.

Tkinter has a little bit of a learning curve, not on its own, mind you, but because it is best used within a class. 

The whole class code logic is often a haze:

What in hell is this parent and where did the stupid child wander again?

class MainApplication(tk.Frame):

def \_\_init\_\_(self, parent):

tk.Frame.\_\_init\_\_(self, parent)

self.parent = parent

Once you get past this...Tkinter is really a nice and handy little tool. Glorious really.",In praise of Tkinter..

This is generally helpful when executing function that are not safe and can throw `RuntimeException` that we want to recover from, and safely execute our logic with clear pipelined operations instead of `throw`ing and `try/catch`-ing Exceptions.

It can also be used as `Optional&lt;T&gt;` where the left value is `Void` and right value is some type `T`.

IO implementations are used very often in FP Scala. I hope this Java version of IO helps someone.

Most of the work I've done so far has been with scientific computing with python but I want to diversify, and head into web development, with some rudimentary work in Django.

I've avoided C# do far because I was under the impression its exculsive to windows, whereas my preferred platform is Linux, but I recently learnt about .NET Core, which sounds like a beloved platform across the aisle, besides I'm opening up to the idea of using windows more actively as well. I'm hoping you guys can give me a quick rundown of what are the advantages and disadvantages of the platform, as well as what course of action I should take

I've researched and found that a null pointer exception occurs when you try to call a method on an object that is not instantiated. However on line 133 `panels [badge.num].add (newCells [i] [j] = new Cell (this));` the elements in the `panels` array are all instantiated and the elements in the `newCells` multidimensional array are all instantiated. So I don't know what is causing the null pointer exception to occur.","How do I solve Exception in thread ""AWT-EventQueue-0"" java.lang.NullPointerException?"

It  was blazing fast and soooo light-weight(probably due to it being an  editor rather an IDE.) Now I am aware we cant compare the two. Atom is  an editor WebStorm is a giant IDE.

Now I recently started using VS Code and loved it too. It's fast, light-weight, modular, open source...

It  starts as an editor but you can turn that cat into a lion if you want  to and the wonderful thing is, IT'S OPTIONAL. So you wont have tons of  plugins slowing you down if you want them. I always loved modular  applications for this reason. You can basically add &amp; remove what  you want and don't want.

Now...

As  a person from the VS Code side of the fence I really wonder how it is  to be in the WebStorm side of the fence. Can you chaps give us any  feedback? Is it still slow?

This should be a possible option, since the database is held on a network drive, and the connectivity may be poor. I'm tearing my hair out trying to figure out how to handle that scenario in Kotlin. I've googled every youtube video and tutorial on exception handling and I'm 1000% clear on how to handle an exception in the abstract, but this simply NEVER works when running the command to connect to the database. (it absolutely DOES work when attempting other processes that could fail, like the often-tutorialed divide-by-zero)

For example:

&gt;try {  
Database.connect(""jdbc:sqlite:$*databaseName*"", ""org.sqlite.JDBC"")  
}   
&gt;  
&gt;catch (e:SQLException){  
return false  
}  
return true

This \_should\_ return false if there was an exception and true if the database connected, however if the database is not found, the program completely crashes rather than handling and returning false.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\[main\] WARN Exposed - Transaction attempt #0 failed: path to '\*\*badpath\*\*': '\\\\' does not exist. Statement(s): null  
&gt;  
&gt;java.sql.SQLException: path to '\*\*badpath\*\*': '\\\\' does not exist  
&gt;  
&gt;	at org.sqlite.SQLiteConnection.open(SQLiteConnection.java:215)  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Process finished with exit code 1

As you can see, the exception IS an SQLException (altho it makes my brain hurt that you have to guess all of the exact types of exceptions your code might ever theoretically have for the try-catch to be able to handle it) 

&amp;#x200B;

So... What am I doing wrong here? Is there a more robust way to tell Kotlin to try something and just let me know if it failed instead of committing ritual suicide?",Exception handling with modules

&amp;#x200B;

I have a background in Human Resources, looking to switch my career path. Therefore I am looking to gain a certification related to Python. I know people working in IT as network technicians and administrators. All of them have achieved a number of certifications (lots of Cisco, oracle or Microsoft), which helped them to get better in their field of work, gain confidence in what the know and advance their career.

However when I looked up certification on the developer side of things, certification seems to be very hard to find. There are certainly some paths to take for proprietary languages and technologies like JAVA or ABAP, but I was unable to find anything like this related to Python.

Is anyone familiar with a certification related to Python, may it be just pure python development or even Python within a broader curriculum?

Any hints would be appreciated.

SIDENOTE:  
Please avoidt any discussion about the usefulness of certification itself. This kind of discussion has dominated every threat i could find on python certification and has always prevented me from getting the actual information I was looking for. On top of that, I had the opportunity to actually consult with HR professionals from companys I would like to work with and know that in the first phase of assessment they would actually rank solid certification over someones github account. So any discussion related to the overall usefulness of certification is not useful to me.",Python related Certification?

Let's talk about the joys of using  \`java.util.List\`. I mean it's an interface, what could go wrong? Let's see what we can expect of any list.

&amp;#x200B;

 We can probably \`add\` to it? Oh, there is \`EmptyList\`, \`SingletonList\`, \`ArrayList$ArrayList\` and all the fancy \`ListN\`, \`List12\` implementation of Java 11 that don't support modyfing the length of the underlying list.

&amp;#x200B;

 What about supporting \`null\` values? Oh \`java.util.List\` tells me that any implementation may impose restrictions, great! So what about \`Collections.sort\`, wait - it works on \`ArrayList\`, even \`Arrays.asList()\` implementation (\`ArrayList$ArrayList\`) but not on \`List.of(...)\` returned lists because they are immutable in addition to being fixed length?

&amp;#x200B;

 I cannot help but wonder what the \`interface\` of \`java.util.List\` even abstracts? Iteration works alright I guess? Everyone tells you to choose interface return-types over specific implementations but guess what - it makes your API wish-wash because we all know: any observed behaviour will be depended upon, so you cannot change from \`ArrayList\`  to \`List.of\` because someone is \`add\`ing to the returned list. 

&amp;#x200B;

\`Map\` is the same, looking at you \`ConcurrentHashMap\` that doesn't support null-values, throws NPEs on \`put\` but just won't \`put\` anything when generating null values in \`putIfAbsent\`, no NPE - nothing!

We need new interfaces for Mutable, Immutable and maybe even FixedLength collections / lists etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is madness.

&amp;#x200B;

Cherry on top: The JVMs JIT (HotSpot to be specific, Graal is a different beast) is pretty good at inling interface types like \`java.util.List\` when it can determine that a given function is only receiving a small amount of different implementations -good luck with that given the new JDK11 list implementations + the already existing ungodly amount of list implementations",The disaster that is Java Collections

jLuaScript is a Java/Lua bridge which allows to execute Lua code which can access the complete Java environment, including all classes. This gives you the ability to quickly write scripts which can interact with Java classes and objects, including third-party jars which you can add at runtime. It comes with a simple runner which allows to execute a script file, but it can just as well be used as a library to be included into another application.

The main goal is to provide a simple environment for creating scripts which can access more complicated logic by utilizing existing Java libraries.

It follows a few simple principles:

 * Java classes must be imported before they can be accessed.
 * Static context is accessed using the dot-notation.
 * Instance context is accessed using the colon-notation.
 * If possible utilize the first-class function nature of Lua.

Here is a simple example script which uses [EvalEx](https://github.com/uklimaschewski/EvalEx) for evaluating an expression.

    loadJar(SCRIPT_DIR, ""evalex.jar"")
    
    import(""java.math.BigDecimal"")
    import(""com.udojava.evalex.Expression"")
    
    local expression = Expression.new(""1 + sqrt(17) * 5.433839 + a"")
    expression:with(""a"", BigDecimal.new(""3.77722""))
    
    local result = expression:eval()
    
    System.out:println(result)

3695,2019-11-16 20:03:20,1,1,"[jLuaScript](https://gitlab.com/RobertZenz/jLuaScript) has now seen it's [1.0 release](https://gitlab.com/RobertZenz/jLuaScript/-/tags/v1.0).

jLuaScript is a Java/Lua bridge which allows to execute Lua code which can access the complete Java environment, including all classes. This gives you the ability to quickly write scripts which can interact with Java classes and objects, including third-party jars which you can add at runtime. It comes with a simple runner which allows to execute a script file, but it can just as well be used as a library to be included into another application.

The main goal is to provide a simple environment for creating scripts which can access more complicated logic by utilizing existing Java libraries.

It follows a few simple principles:

 * Java classes must be imported before they can be accessed.
 * Static context is accessed using the dot-notation.
 * Instance context is accessed using the colon-notation.
 * If possible utilize the first-class function nature of Lua.

Here is a simple example script which uses [EvalEx](https://github.com/uklimaschewski/EvalEx) for evaluating an expression.

    loadJar(SCRIPT_DIR, ""evalex.jar"")
    
    import(""java.math.BigDecimal"")
    import(""com.udojava.evalex.Expression"")
    
    local expression = Expression.new(""1 + sqrt(17) * 5.433839 + a"")
    expression:with(""a"", BigDecimal.new(""3.77722""))
    
    local result = expression:eval()
    
    System.out:println(result)

Another very important feature is that you can implement *any* interface or extend *any* class:

    import(""java.lang.Runnable"")
    
    local RunnableImpl = Runnable.implement({
        run = function()
            -- Put logic here.
        end
    })
    
    local runnableInstance = RunnableImpl.new()
    
    runnableInstance:run()

When extending a class or implementing an interface, you're providing a Lua table which contains the functions you want to assign. If there is only one function, you can skip the table and provide the function directly:

    import(""java.lang.Runnable"")

        -- Put logic here.
    end)
    
    local runnableInstance = RunnableImpl.new()
    
    runnableInstance:run()

If you only need an instance *now*, there is also a shorthand for that:

    import(""java.lang.Runnable"")
    
    Runnable.implementNew(function()
        -- Put logic here.
    end):run()

3696,2019-11-17 11:47:06,5,1,"I thought that plain java was not distracting enough, so I created a Java package to make it read like Rockstar. Please pardon my horrible coding skills. It makes programs look like this:

}

I.scream(Tommy);

The package abuses Java Objects and is integratabtle into existing Java programs. It supports Float, Boolean, Strings and even Arrays of more Rockstar Objects. I have tried my best to make it conform to almost all Rockstar specs. Deviations were made due to my incompetence or attempts to make it easier to integrate with library functions. It is a vastly inefficient way of programming and consumes way more resources than needed, but makes code fun to read and near impossible to edit without understanding Rockstar specs or the documentation. Pretty fun for obfuscation. This also makes it possible to code a game in Rockstar-like language. Makes coding rockstar-style easier.

This might not be java specifc, but more a general question, but since I am working in java right now, I'll ask here. Disclaimer: I'm fairly new to java and I am trying to translate a python script.

So, the problem:

Lets say 260. It is larger than 255, so I need a byte array of size 2.

The binary representation is 0000000100000100
My current way to store it is to split the string up into chunks of 8, convert to decimal numbers and store those in the byte array.

So, in this example, the two substrings would be 00000001 and 0000100, im decimal 1 and 4.
Then I store them in the byte array, so 
b[0]=1
b[1]=4

## Top 5 Kotlin server-side frameworks-

### 1. Javalin-

 

Basically, Javalin is just a few thousand lines of code over Jetty. It began as a fork of the Java and also Kotlin web framework Spark, which immediately turned into a ground- up rewrite influenced by the Javascript framework koa.js. Since the first release, A new version is released two times per month (overall), where each non-major version is backward compatible.

#### Advantages-

* It centers around completing things rapidly. In some cases this doesn’t feel like an advantage
* Simple to use
* Embedded Jetty server
* Lightweight and fast, especially compared to other counterparts here.
* Lambda- based WebSocket API
* Real micro- framework

#### Limitations-

* Documentation is not a great. While suitable for someone with a prior Javalin knowledge; it simply not good for someone who simply needs to learn from scratch. 
* Not sticking to standard terminology. For instance, what is normally known as Routes and Filters are combined together as Handlers. Which makes it harder when you read outsider tutorials and people keep referring to it as routes or filters.
* Not develop enough; their feature to-do list is still excessively long. To battle this you should depend on outsider dependencies and that is an extremely profound gap. 

### 2. KTor-

 

Ktor is a framework for rapidly making web applications in Kotlin with minimal effort. It is very light and don’t impose any constraints on what underlying technology a project is going to use. What makes it stand up is that it’s created by the Kotlin team. 

#### Advantages–

* Reliable and stable
* Small memory footprint and lightweight
* Fast but competition is faster (like Javalin and http4d)
* Perfect for prototyping
* Real micro-framework

#### Limitations-

* Experiences a similar issue as Javalin. If you have to make anything complex you should incline toward third-party libraries.
* If you do not know what are you doing then documentation is going to be confusing as hell.
* Not mature enough
* Small community

### 3. Spark-

 

Spark is the typical suspect with regards to micro-services. It’s one of the oldest expressive Kotlin/ Java web framework built for rapid development, you can even consider it a higher level of Kotlin frameworks. Really awful the support is still in the alpha version.

#### Advantages-

* Small memory footprint
* Fast and also a lightweight
* Excellent for rapid prototyping
* Easy to setup
* Plays well with Angular
* Real micro-framework
* Embedded Jetty server

#### Limitations-

* Documentation could be better, it is not intended for beginners.
* Not appropriate for large projects. 

### 4. Spring Boot-

 

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand- alone, production- grade Spring based Applications that you can “just run”.

#### Advantages-

* Can create stand- alone spring applications
* Easy to setup and handle
* Spring family environment
* Modular
* Plays well with other libraries
* Large community (very popular)
* Enterprise-ready

#### Limitations-

* Documentation fragmentation. Too many sources, too many versions, too many differences. Make sure you know which version you are going to use.
* Breaking changes between versions. If you hate what Angular is doing you will also hate it here.
* Confusing documentation. 

### 5. Vert.x-

 

Vert.x is a tool- kit for building reactive applications in a different programming language, like Java and Kotlin. This tool (kit) is powerful, however, it is not for everyone. Keep reading and you will find why.

#### Advantages-

* Fast
* Small memory footprint – Comparable to Spark
* WebSockets support
* Reactive systems approach. The idea is to have more flexible, loosely-coupled and scalable applications.
* Vert.x offers a complete ecosystem
* Highly modular

#### Limitations-

* It’s not for everybody. As a reactive toolkit, it fills a different niche compared to other frameworks here. 
* Not a solution for you if the Spring Boot is your framework of choice. Before you try it make sure you know what are you getting into.

## Conclusion-

Just like with Java, this comparison is a fight between well- established all-around frameworks and their more lean micro-service counterparts. Here we’ve listed out some advantages and also limitations of each framework. Know the comparison between Kontin and Java at- [**Kotlin vs Java**](https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/kotlin-vs-java/).

Currently i am trying to get some file generated by the webpage by the query.       

I managed to get to the point where file starts to download using :         

* WebClient       
* WebBrowser (simple embedded in form)         
* HTTPWebRequest         

The problem is that in none of the cases i cannot download the file using normal events - but always i am getting native **File Download** windows popup.               

I know that i am doing probably some dumb thing but maybe someone can help me to narrow the issue:                

&gt; HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(mUrl);

This is N variation of the code - i know it can be better but my current issue is to attach to this download.        
The response AsyncCallback(PlayResponeAsync)   is never ""fired"" but native file download window opens.                

Tried all the webbrowser/client/httpwebrequest file/stream download functions and events.

3754,2019-12-07 15:43:55,1,1,"Hi fellow java developers,

We are working on a project related to Hazelcast and having relatively weird numbers from our performance tests. We could be doing something wrong and our tests could be flawed but I have some theory to support numbers and wanted to ask you, your opinion on the matter.

According to its documentation, Hazelcast tries to balance memory across its members. To explain it with numbers, if you have a map with 100 values that's being distributed to two Hazelcast members,  it means each member will be holding 50 of them ( I'm skipping stuff related to backups for the sake of simplicity). With this setup, when you need to access any of the values, there is a 50% chance of hitting to other member, so that means additional network call.   


Our current microservice setup shares Hazelcast map with just two members, however when we scale up our nodes to ten, our application is getting slower. And all the monitoring tools we have got point problems to Hazelcast calls.   


Our naive theory is, as with two members only half of the value reads requires network call, and with ten members, 90% of them requires network call, Hazelcast is actually getting slower with more members.  Does this make sense? What do you think ?  


Note: To clarify with numbers, with two members and 100 values, each member will hold 50 of them so you have %50 chance of being on the same JVM so less network calls. With ten members with 100 values, each member will hold 10 values so being on the same JVM with value access is getting slimmer. Only 10% of them could be on same JVM, so more network calls, less performance.","Hazelcast scales up, and gets slower"

3759,2019-12-07 18:09:51,4,1,"A couple of days ago the question was posited here: [what are some valid criticisms against C#/.NET](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/e654k7/what_are_some_valid_criticisms_against_cnet/)?   One criticism was that C# enums aren't like those Java enum object thingies.  This is still bothering me, so here's a new question and an answer.

One feature I initially disliked when introduced in C# was extension methods.  They've grown on me since.  I suppose it helps that more modern .NET libs, like most of core, lean on the things heavily.  When I found out you could use extension methods with enums my first thought of was **bloody java enums**.

So, how does everyone feel about extension methods in C#?

And, if you really like the [Java enum](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html) thing I have a C# solution for you.

Java code:

    public enum Planet {
        MERCURY (3.303e+23, 2.4397e6),
        VENUS   (4.869e+24, 6.0518e6),
        EARTH   (5.976e+24, 6.37814e6),
        MARS    (6.421e+23, 3.3972e6),
        JUPITER (1.9e+27,   7.1492e7),
        SATURN  (5.688e+26, 6.0268e7),
        URANUS  (8.686e+25, 2.5559e7),
        NEPTUNE (1.024e+26, 2.4746e7);
    
        private final double mass;   // in kilograms
        private final double radius; // in meters
        Planet(double mass, double radius) {
            this.mass = mass;
            this.radius = radius;
        }

        private double radius() { return radius; }

        }
        double surfaceWeight(double otherMass) {
            return otherMass * surfaceGravity();
        }

                System.err.println(""Usage: java Planet &lt;earth_weight&gt;"");

            }
            double earthWeight = Double.parseDouble(args[0]);
            double mass = earthWeight/EARTH.surfaceGravity();
            for (Planet p : Planet.values())
               System.out.printf(""Your weight on %s is %f%n"",
                                 p, p.surfaceWeight(mass));

I was recently contacted by a recruiter about a student position at her company. She sent me the bellow exercise and told me to send back a solution within one hour. 

I did just that, and a week later received a negative response. I am completely self taught and therefore have never had any true feedback of my code, so this was a massive blow, considering how easy the exercise is. 

I was stumped as I did the exercise the only way I thought possible, so I would love to see how you guys might approach  this:

   

1) Define the classes ‘Vehicle’,  ‘Car’, ‘Motorcycle’ (You may need to add classes!)

Car and Motorcycle can have Fuel **or** Electric Engine.

For each class provide the method toString() which prints the object type and its data.

Each class also has:

Members:

1. Number of wheels.

2. Engine type.

Methods:

1. The method getNumberOfWheels() that return the number of wheels.

2. The method getAmountOfEnergy() that return the amount of fuel / battery left in the engine.

&amp;#x200B;

2)Write a Main class that defines the following 4 vehicles in a list

&amp;#x200B;

1. car with **4 wheels** and **fuel engine** that have **20 liters** left.
2. car with **4 wheels** and **electric engine** that have **40% left in the battery**.
3. Motorcycle with **2 wheels** and **fuel engine** that have **5 liters** left.
4. Motorcycle with **2 wheels** and **electric engine** that have **80% left in the battery.**

&amp;#x200B;

3)Add a method to the Main class that sorts the list of vehicles in descending order, so that:

&amp;#x200B;

1. fuel engines are prioritized over electric engines
2. energy values are prioritized as highest first

for example: (7 liters -&gt; 2 liters -&gt; 25% -&gt; 10%)

4) Print the sorted list of vehicles by calling the toString() method of every object in a loop",JAVA Interview question

I am trying to learn Kotlin/Native with Gradle ─I'm new to both, Native and Gradle, but no Kotlin itself ─, but I am having a rough time including Java libraries (standard ones). I can do a simple *Hello, World!* in Native, but as soon as I try to import, for example, `import java.io.File` I got on `gradle build`:

```gradle
&gt; Task :compileKotlinNative FAILED
e: /.../src/nativeMain/kotlin/Main.kt: (1, 8): Unresolved reference: java
```

My `build.gradle.kts` is as simple as:

```gradle
plugins {
    kotlin(""multiplatform"") version ""1.3.61""
    application
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile(""org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:1.3.61"")
}

kotlin {
	linuxX64(""native"") {
		binaries {
			executable()
		}
	}
}

tasks.withType&lt;Wrapper&gt; {
  gradleVersion = ""6.0.1""
  distributionType = Wrapper.DistributionType.ALL
}

application {
    mainClassName = ""MainKt""
}
```

It's pretty much what JetBrains mark as necessary to build a Native application.

It works if I change `""multiplatform""` to `""jvm""` and take out the `kotlin {}` block, but obviously the build stops being native; or if I simply comment the import, but I will need it eventually. Since what I want is simply understand and test the concepts, the code in `Main.kt` for now is as simple as:

```
import java.io.File //this would be the conflicting line

fun main() {
    println(""Hello, there"")
}

As a learning exercise, I am trying to convert a Java library to Kotlin. (If it matters, I am talking about algs4 from Sedgewick and Wayne companion site to algorithms 4ty edition).

Now, what is the proper way to do it?
I understand, that I could just create kotlin class and call all the static methods with companion object, however I am curious what is the ""right"" way to do it.
1. Create an object, with the same name as the static class object and put everything inside of it? 
2. Just write standalone functions together with global objects?
3. Do it as it was done in java - a static class (companion object + JvmStatic).

Also, there is a static block in the static class I am trying to convert. If I understand correctly, the cose inside of static block should be put inside of init function in (companion) object.
However, what is the alternative to static block (I mean static{ somecode }) in java if my code is not inside of an object or a class?

I can use `with patch(...) as logger:`, but that creates two other problems:

- It's not as ergonomic and would force me to rewrite a ton of code while migrating to pytest.
  - This is something I'd get over if there's really no way to use `patch` in this way.
- If I use a fixture that does some kind of setup, like [the current `IsolatedYcmd`\* decorator](https://github.com/ycm-core/ycmd/blob/master/ycmd/tests/java/__init__.py#L93-L110), using `with patch()` form might be too late to patch things.
  - This is the important part.

I have seen the `pytest-mock` plugin, but it doesn't solve the second concern above.

\* A proof of concept `IsolatedYcmd` written as a pytest fixture can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/bstaletic/58540a12275a88882b7f920e669d093d#file-pytest-py-L14-L27)

&amp;nbsp;

For what it's worth, this is the last piece of the puzzle I need in order to switch to pytest.

As you can see, most of the artifacts are created as intended. But some (iosarm32, iosxX64,...) seem to follow a different pattern. They are not put into the correct subfolder and they carry the 4.10.1 version number I have never configured.

And also: I alsways get this \*already exists under another version\* error.

Whats going wrong here? Why are these artifacts setup with another version number? And why do I get the copying conflict?",Creating a Kotlin MP library for Bintray Publishing
3889,2020-01-20 22:18:30,3,1,"Hi! I'm pretty new to Kotlin/Android development and I've been building an app, but now I noticed that when I change Fragments (using a navController) the state of my fragment isn't restored.

Let's say I have a fragment with a simple button that is disabled on click. How would I keep this button disabled when going to a different fragment and then coming back?

Do I also need to account for closing and reopening the app? And what about 'hard resetting' the app?

3908,2020-01-26 07:18:22,0,1,"Part I

&amp;#x200B;

Create a Java program that inputs a grade from the user. The grade input from the user will be an integer. Once the input is stored, use an if-else-if block of code to determine the letter grade of the inputted integer grade. Do not use a bunch of if statements by themselves to solve this problem. You will print an error message for inputs greater than 100 and for inputs less than 0. Both errors must be handled together by a compound conditional statement that is joined by a short circuit AND or OR operator. Assign your error message to a String variable and use that variable in a System.out.println statement to print the error. You must assign a char variable for each letter grade. Use System.out.printf to print the letter grade.

&amp;#x200B;

Run your program several times using these inputs and ensure that you are receiving these outputs:

&amp;#x200B;

input: 140

expected output: ERROR - You have entered an invalid input.

Input: -45

expected output: ERROR - You have entered an invalid input.

input: 82

expected output: You have earned the letter grade B.

Run it a few more times using various other inputs.

&amp;#x200B;

Part II

Convert the if-else-if code block to a switch statement to solve the problem. Use modulus and/or integer division to convert the grade input so that the range of grades are converted to one value. All other requirements from Part I are still required for part two. Use the same inputs and the outputs should remain the same.

&amp;#x200B;

My Code

&amp;#x200B;

import java.util.Scanner;

&amp;#x200B;

int grade;

&amp;#x200B;

System.out.print(\&amp;quot;Enter your grade: \&amp;quot;);

grade = scnr.nextInt();

&amp;#x200B;

if (grade \&amp;gt;= 90) {

System.out.println(\&amp;quot;You have earned the letter grade A.\&amp;quot;);

}

else if (grade \&amp;gt;= 80) {

System.out.println(\&amp;quot;You have earned the letter grade B.\&amp;quot;);

}

else if (grade \&amp;gt;= 70) {

System.out.println(\&amp;quot;CYou have earned the letter grade C.\&amp;quot;);

}

else if (grade \&amp;gt;= 60) {

System.out.println(\&amp;quot;You have earned the letter grade D.\&amp;quot;);

}

else if (grade \&amp;lt;= 59) {

System.out.println(\&amp;quot;You have earned the letter grade F.\&amp;quot;);

Now I am really lost.

I don't know what these mean &lt;&gt;, they normally come with something inside, I have seen ArrayList&lt;String&gt; for example in java so maybe it means type?

I don't know what &lt;T,R&gt; means, I don't know what Collection&lt;T&gt;.fold is and so on.

I feel this is a common problem for me with documentation, I only can understand the documentation when I understand the subject it is talking about, hence rendering the documentation a lot less useful.

Could somebody, explain in detail how to understand something like this and how I should approach the documentation in order to get the best comprehension?

I tested it and in fact you can nest the println() statements in Kotlin whereas JAVA just doesn't let you do that. However the output is a bit confusing to interpret for me. 

I ran this code : 

`println({print(print(""This!""))})`

and got this as output : 

`() -&gt; kotlin.Unit`

and for statement :

`println(print(print(""This!"")))`

I got this as output : 

`This!kotlin.Unitkotlin.Unit`

I am curious as to if there are hazards, if any, to this approach, or is it just that Kotlin realized what JAVA missed out on.",Why everything has to return something in Kotlin?

3939,2020-02-06 12:19:14,0,1,"I have a problem with coding a Chat application. One of the planned features is getting connected with a random user from the database. Currently I have one button that loads an overview of all users, you can chose one user, and you can chat with that person (message send/receive works, also when i close the app and open it again the messages are still viewable and saved).

For that, I have a NewMessageActivity, which on click on one user leads to the ChatLogActivity and takes the user information with it (toUser and USER_KEY).

Now my plan is to basically skip the NewMessage part and get right into the ChatLogActivity, and assign a random user to that.

I was thinking to just add something like an if/else to my code (so, if toUser is assigned by NewMessageActivity load that, otherwise load random), but I can't get it to work. My users have each individual uid's, that get created randomly when signing up.
Here's my code:

    companion object {
        val TAG = ""ChatLog""
    }
    val adapter = GroupAdapter&lt;GroupieViewHolder&gt;()

    var toUser: User? = null

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_chat_log)


        recyclerview_chat_log.adapter = adapter

        keyboardManagement()




        toUser = intent.getParcelableExtra&lt;User&gt;(NewMessageActivity.USER_KEY)

        supportActionBar?.title = toUser?.username



        listenForMessages()

        send_button_chat_log.setOnClickListener {
            Log.d(TAG, ""Attempt to send message"")
            performSendMessage()
        }

    } 

Here's how I usually get the users for the chat, in case that is important:

        val ref = FirebaseDatabase.getInstance().getReference(""/users"")
        ref.addListenerForSingleValueEvent(object: ValueEventListener{

            override fun onDataChange(p0: DataSnapshot) {

                p0.children.forEach{
                    Log.d(""NewMessage"", it.toString())
                    val user = it.getValue(User::class.java)
                    if (user != null) {
                        adapter.add(UserItem(user))
                    }
                }

                adapter.setOnItemClickListener{ item, view -&gt;

                    //intent.putExtra(USER_KEY, userItem.user!)
                    intent.putExtra(USER_KEY, userItem.user)

                    startActivity(intent)

                    //Zurück zum Main Menu statt zur User Auswahl
                    finish()
                }

                recyclerView_newmessage.adapter = adapter
            }

            override fun onCancelled(p0: DatabaseError) {

            }
        })
    }
}

**5 Key Reasons to Use Python with Preference:**

1. ***Readable and Maintainable Code:*** Focus on the quality of source code to simplify the maintenance and updates is must for writing a software application. Python syntax rules allow expressing the concepts without using the additional codes. Unlike other programming languages, Python emphasizes on simple code readability, thus, it allows using English keywords rather than punctuations.
2. ***Compatible with Major Systems and Platforms:*** Python is supports numbers of operating systems. Python, as an interpreted programming language, allows running the same code over multiple platforms. Python users don’t need code recompilation after making alterations. Users can check the impact of made changes over the codes immediately. It helps the web and application professionals to complete the project in estimated time.
3. ***Robust Library:*** Python has its own standard library that makes it worldwide popular. The integrated library allows to pick the best from the range of modules in the line of particular needs. Each module enables to add additional functionality to Python application without need to write additional codes. Information about different modules can be had by browsing through Python Library documentation.
4. ***Open Source Tools and Frameworks:*** The numbers of open source Python frameworks reduce the software development cost significantly. Python frameworks, libraries and open source development tools reduce the development time. Selection of tools and frameworks can be done according to the project nature. For example, users can speedup and simplify the web application development project by using the Python web frameworks like Pyramid, Bottle, Cherrypy, Django and Flask etc.
5. ***Test Driven Development*****:** Python allows performing coding and testing simultaneously through test driven development (TDD) approach. It allows developing prototype of software application. Users can write the tests before code writing and apply the tests to judge the application code.

**Scope of Learning Python for Career Building:**

* Python is voted as the most favorite programming language surpassing the popularity of C, C++ and java programming languages.
* Career opportunities associated with Python have also grown significantly as its popularity has increased by 40%.
* Python job profiles include Python Developer, Senior Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Software Developer and Data Scientist etc.
* Ansible, Netmiko, NAPALM, Pyeapi, Junos PyEZ, PySNMP, Paramiko SSH etc Python libraries are being used extensively by the network engineers for network automation.
* Python libraries and toolkits like Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, SciPy and GraphLab Create etc are being used worldwide for Data analysis and managing big data issues.
* Python programming language dominates other languages when Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used.
* More and more professionals are using Python for system administration, web development, application development and developing games etc.

Google has recently replaced Java with Kotlin for Android development. As a result, all Android developers must learn Kotlin to develop applications for Android Smartphone devices. At this point, many people may think that learning Java is no more required. In reality, Kotlin is an improved version of Java. It uses its library. It further comes with most of the features and options.

**Kotlin vs. Java - Conciseness**

When it comes to comparing the conciseness factor, Kotlin has been noted as more concise. Writing the Java codes take space and time because it needs a boil plate code. For example, public static void main (String \[\] args){} ) code which consumes space and time. The same cannot be said in the case of Kotlin. Writing Kotlin codes is easier and it takes lesser space. It is a contemporary and improvised version of Java. It does not need a boilerplate code. Hence, it is expected to be more compact compared to the Java programming language. Also, it is more expressive, clean and powerful.

**Comparing the Safety Aspect**

Now, it is time to compare the safety aspects. Which one among Java and Kotlin can be regarded as safer? Since Kotlin is a contemporary coding language, it comes with better safety features. It makes your algorithm safer, as it knows the contemporary challenges. [Read More](https://www.apsmind.com/apsmind/blog/java-vs-kotlin-comparision.html)",Java vs Kotlin - comparison

It's scripts require js coding so i goy going.

I wanted to type this line

the syntax would be type("" (whatever you want it to type here ) "")

First of all it doesnt accept letters like "" etc (giver an error) and changes some letters like \\ and $ with other ones so in this case it doesnt accept them and i believe if it does it will probably type some rubbish interchanged characters. it only accepts normal alphabets not any special character.

Is it the strings im messing up or what and how can i fix it, basically how can i get it to type the lines i want to

1. Download the Java JAR (Snapshot) ([https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/4.3.0-SNAPSHOT/openapi-generator-cli-4.3.0-20200220.141445-113.jar](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/4.3.0-SNAPSHOT/openapi-generator-cli-4.3.0-20200220.141445-113.jar))
2. Rename the JAR as ""openapi-generator-cli.jar""
3. Run the following command to generate a TypeScript Angular 9 client for the Petstore API ([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.yaml)):

Mac/Linux:

\- java -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar generate -g typescript-angular -i [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2\_0/petstore.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.yaml) \-o /var/tmp/typescript-angular/

\- java -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar generate -g typescript-angular -i [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2\_0/petstore.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.yaml) \-o C:\\tmp\\typescript-angular

To generate an older version of TypeScript Angular client, use `ngVersion`. For example, to generate Angular 8 client:

```
java -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar generate -g typescript-angular -i [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2\_0/petstore.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/2_0/petstore.yaml) \-o /var/tmp/typescript-angular/ --additional-properties ngVersion=8

A while back I worked at a company where \*everyone\* used intelliJ for the [play](https://www.playframework.com/)\-[angular](https://angular.io/) stack we were working on. I've never liked IDEs because 1. they're bloated resource hogs, 2. they take a long time to master, and 3. they hide a ton of details under the hood. I much prefer using smart text editors like vim and vscode. I also much prefer creating bash scripts and config files so that every command/setting is in a clear place, rather than being buried within a complex sequence of mouse clicks.

So I was the only one at this company not using intelliJ and I found that this made it really difficult to work with everyone else since everything they did was done through intelliJ, including VC and CI. This experience and feeling that I could only work on a professional java stack if I used intelliJ really put me off Java.

4025,2020-03-06 10:51:01,2,1,"I'm a kotlin/android noob, so I'm still getting my head wrapped around how all the parts of android development work together (specifically, the bluetooth API). I'm trying to adapt [this half-finished example project](https://github.com/Nithinjith/LEKotlin-Android) to get it working on a BLE heart rate peripheral (the stock example from Espressif, running on an ESP32 dev board).

Here's how I'm managing the BLE connection:

    object BLEConnectionManager {
    
        private val TAG = ""BLEConnectionManager""
        private var mBLEService: BLEService? = null
        private var isBind = false
        private val mServiceConnection = object : ServiceConnection {
            override fun onServiceConnected(componentName: ComponentName, service: IBinder) {
                mBLEService = (service as BLEService.LocalBinder).getService()
                Log.i(TAG, ""BLEConnectionManager.onServiceConnected mBLEService = $mBLEService"")
                if (!mBLEService?.initialize()!!) {
                    Log.e(TAG, ""Unable to initialize"")
                }
            }
            override fun onServiceDisconnected(componentName: ComponentName) {
                mBLEService = null
            }
        }
    
        fun initBLEService(context: Context) {
            try {
                if (mBLEService == null) {
                    val gattServiceIntent = Intent(context, BLEService::class.java)
                    if (context != null) {
                        isBind = context.bindService(gattServiceIntent, mServiceConnection,
                            Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE)
                        Log.i(TAG, ""BLEConnectionManager.initBLEService isBind = $isBind"")
                    }
                }
            } catch (e: Exception) {
                Log.e(TAG, e.message)
            }
        }
    
        fun connect(deviceAddress: String): Boolean {
            var result = false
            Log.i(TAG, ""BLEConnectionManager.connect (to $deviceAddress) and mBLEService is $mBLEService"")
            if (mBLEService != null) result = mBLEService!!.connect(deviceAddress)
            return result
        }
    // ...etc

And call this in the main activity onCreate:

    if (!BLEDeviceManager.isEnabled()) {
 val enableBtIntent = Intent(BluetoothAdapter.ACTION_REQUEST_ENABLE)
    startActivityForResult(enableBtIntent, REQUEST_ENABLE_BT)
}
BLEConnectionManager.initBLEService(this@MainActivity)

The BLEService class is unchanged from the [original code](https://github.com/Nithinjith/LEKotlin-Android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/np/lekotlin/blemodule/BLEService.kt).

When I run it, `$mBLEService` is null in `connect`, and I note that when `initBLEService` is called, `$isBind` is always null too. I therefore think I don't properly understand the mechanics of how services work and what they do in this instance. So, why am I unable to bind the service, and is the binding problem the cause of the service being null?",Anyone know why I'm unable to bind to my service in this code?

4030,2020-03-07 21:57:09,41,1,"I'm shocked! 

A year ago, I was sitting around the kitchen table talking to my brother and telling him that I wanted to learn how to code. 

That same night, I signed up for Lynda.com ... After a month I gave up... I don't even remember why. All I know is that from the videos I watched I didn't feel confident enough to build anything. Everything felt jumbled.

A month went buy and I decided to download [https://books.apple.com/us/book/app-development-with-swift/id1465002990](https://books.apple.com/us/book/app-development-with-swift/id1465002990) ... I cannot express how much this book helped me consolidate the core concepts of Swift and Object Oriented Programming (OOP). 

I'm not going to lie; I've always been interested in coding—ever since the Myspace days. However, other than some VB projects, light CSS, and HTML; I had never actually invested enough time to get past the first hurdle of just understanding OOP. I purchased books and would never actually read past the first few chapters (PHP, JAVA, LINUX Kernals). Ironically, I still have the Java book and to my surprise I actually understand it now. 

I remember going through these book and feeling overwhelmed by concepts. This was not the feeling the Apple book gave me. When I finished it I felt confident enough to start my own little projects and use YouTube and stack overflow to find answers when I became stuck.

I watched some coding videos from Sean Allen and thought to myself that I would never have code like that (Funny enough it was just basic stuff still). 

It's crazy, that was only a few months ago. I now have several projects, an app on the App Store, and what I feel, is an in-depth understanding of OOP. I've started implementing BDD, and writing code that is less dependent on specific types and easier to write unit tests for. 

I never thought I'd be able to write something like the class below, especially without using external references but I can now do it. 

So, I just wanted to share this post in case there's someone out there who is worried that they won't be able to learn this stuff. I'm here to tell you that you can. All you need to do is invest time. I literally have spent the last year writing code or reading about swift for about 12hr a day after work. 

Today, I started a new chapter in my programming career. I downloaded Visual Studio Code and started learning Javascript so that I can write my own template file for my website and ditch the $80 Shopify monthly subscription I currently am paying.

I'm also looking for a job and am open to relocating if anyone here is an employer.

Project was created in maven but not executed with Maven. We just either execute using testNG test or by testNG XML. I need to create an executable jar file for standalone mode to give it to other team members who do not have eclipse. So this has been done before me. This person (who is not co-operative at all and would not give me the command or let me know how to  doit), created a taf folder inside user/documents. This taf folder has following folders

cfg (contains xml files),

 testData(all uploads and excel file for usernames and passwords) 

downloads folder(for downloads) test-output(for extent reports and test outputs)

 test-outputDocuments(for backup reports) 

drivers( FF, I-e and chrome drivers) 

test-screenshots(to generate screenshots) all these names are same as in the real project. 

one extra folder is libs that contains all the jar files from the project. but one extra which is taf.jar. 

Then there is a batch file in taf folder that when clicked runs the test case. it has the command ""java -cp ./lib/\*;./drivers/\*;.; org.testng.testNG ./cfg/\*.xml "" so basically it runs the xml file inside cfg folder.

what I could dig so far on this is: 1- taf.jar contains all the .class files with folders and config folder. the MANIFEST file is default one generated by java while generating the exe jar file as it only contains META-INF folder, with MANIFEST.MF containing manifest-version 1.0 and Created-By: 1.8.0-181(Oracle Corporation) 2- All the dependencies inside maven do not contain the one for jar file creation. no main class. (as it is testNG based) 3- there is stand-Alone Mode false for eclipse runs but u have to make it true for stand alone mode as it changes home-dir .

So far what ever I have found is either using a Manifest.txt which contains a main class or through MVN commands which do not work on this project as they throw a lot of errors. If I am missing anything please do ask",Need help creating an executable jar file. willing to pay

So whats up with JS stack &amp; heap concept ?  
It seems that JS' heap, where objects exists have nothing to do with Browser storage.  
So now I want to ask, is it possible at all, to create an object whos 'lifetime' extends across browser tabs ?  
I understand that this is probably bad to do, but I am curious as to how such a thing (if possible) would work without leveraging local storage.

Now for anyone who has used RxJs, there is something called Subject, which is a type of observable that you can also publish data to. This holds a bit of state.  
Where does the rxJS Subject exist, and or how is it storing that data ? This question applies to Ngrx statemanagement library, since it does not store data in browser storage on its own.

4066,2020-03-19 21:25:41,1,1,"We use Java in the following ways that I know of:

1. Numerous systems we've purchased from turnkey vendors running intranet sites that function with Java code.  Either Javascript on page or using downloadable JNLP files.

2.  Numerous rich desktop apps that are programmed in Java... usually have a /java/bin folder embedded in them with binaries that connect to internal app servers and whatnot

3.  We have 3 browsers that are deployed and we access the intranet sites with the JRE plugin... we currently have Java 8u241 deployed but it looks like that may not be a free version, does this need to be rolled back to 201?

Anyone the Oracle rep has been contacting us.  I'd rather figure this out myself or with the communities help.

So on option 1 most of these sites never get updated.  Sad but true (you guys have seen it, flame on if you feel the need).  What are licensing concerns here if any?

On option 2, once again, these apps are never updated.  That embedded Java inside stays on the same version, if I scan these workstations with these installed apps with a vuln scanner they tell me a vulnerable version of Java is on the system, but its only invoked by the app itself... doesn't worry me too much since they all connect to intranet app servers, etc.  Are there any licensing concerns here?

Option 3 is the one that bothers me.  We keep our browser plugins up-to-date.  Java 6u27 was the catalyst that caused us to do that.  We have a nice deployment routine for Java MSIs and an eloquent script in SCCM that keeps our Java plugins up-to-date.  This has caused some issues with some of the sites... considering they are running on old,  unsigned code... but we managed the JRE centrally via GPO and we push a site exception list out for intranet sites... this way we still have up-to-date JRE if they access Java enabled sites on the public internet through their browsers.  Problem is I believe we aren't supposed to move beyond 8u201 here.  I can't block Java in the browser or half our Java-enabled intranet sites will stop working.

Can I go openJDK here... does it have a plugin for browsers, or because of our usage are we going to have to get some kinda site license so we can keep Java up-to-date in our browsers.

My ecosystem has taken me years to put in place and fine-tune.  half of my apprehension with contacting the Oracle rep back is I really don't want to try and get him to understand why we do what we do.  We aren't devs, but we have a lot of infrastructure and a lot of it runs Java.",Help me decipher our Java usage plz and how does new licensing restrictions apply?

I have tried both pygame and pyglet, but I am open to other options as well. My main problem with pygame is that I don't really like the control flow and I wasn't able to get smooth motion to work. On the other hand, I like pyglet's control flow because it is similar to Processing, but doing things like drawing a rectangle or using a spritesheet are very time consuming and difficult with no clear explanation. I know processing for python exists, but it is not a module to import, it is a java executable that interprets the python code, which I do not like the idea of very much. If anyone has a suggestion on what I should use, or a different library (even a python-based graphical editor) that I could use to make a game that I can incorporate tensorflow into, please let me know. Thank you!","Which Game Library Should I use for my project (Pygame, Pyglet or other)"

My general distaste for all things Spring has me suggesting that we go full on RxJava throughout the layers of the Spring service. But he's telling me that Reactor has better support in Spring and R2DBC works with Reactor out of the box, and not RxJava.

Searching this sub, I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/6acxe3/spring_reactor_vs_rxjava/) archived post, that says Reactor is more performant due to RxJava2 needing to do more atomics stuff because of Java 6 support. But RxJava 3 is Java 8+ like Reactor now.

So I'm wondering - what would you guys do? I've never worked with Reactor so I'm biased towards RxJava. Is my bias misplaced?

My major is Master's in Chem eng &amp; Chemistry. I frankly didn't want to go to chemistry/chem eng field but I was kind of forced to go to this industry since my dad was so adamant on it.

I always wanted to do something with computer software development or games. Now that I have a job, I really do not want to stay in this field for the rest of my life. Even though I'm in my 30's I want to change my career. I'm learning C++ on my own and my plan in near future is to make a simple game or an app and using that as my resume.

In your professional field, is this enough to get you a job? or do you need much more than that?

And also, how would you rate the importance of optimization like in terms of Olog(n)?

Any inputs are appreciated. Happy coding!

&amp;#x200B;

edit: Holy crap! Thank you so much for your opinions. I see why I'm learning C++ particularly. Well.. because I heard it's powerful and the knowledge can easily be transferred to other languages since it both offers procedural programming and OOP. Also, I heard that a lot of game engines are built on C++ like Unity and my end goal is to become a game dev. 

I heard a lot of Java and very interested in learning the language. However, since I already started learning C++, I'd like to finish one small project with it and learn java after. I feel like picking up java after C++ won't be too hard. I do have a brief history of using Python and Matlab to code many mathematical formulas in Univ classes such as solving Schrodinger's equations, multiple differential equations. Of course, many hours of writing code in reaction engineering classes as well. I loved the classes where I had to code. It was fun.

I thought about integrating programming to my field and will be actively looking for the opportunity when I have enough experience in my current job, at least an year (I started this job a few months ago). Unfortunately, my work is more related to process side of chem eng and it is already automated and I believe we outsourced the all the software stuff to a different company.

Now, we are working a product  that consistes of two UIs (eclipse and Web) and a java runtime. It's  been developed for more than ten years and we have around 45000 tests in  total, which combine UI, system, integration and unit tests. Out of all of them, 3200 are unit tests, so less than 10%.

So over time we adapted a style of testing a lot of stuff with integration and system tests, which makes sense, as we are heavily integrated into  several systems around us (two application servers, eclipse, multiple  messaging broker, different database backends, ...).

I think it is  totally unrealistic to have 80% code coverage for new unit tests and it  showed already. Two members started writing tests that covered a lot of code, but still were green when I went ahead and deleted production code from  that covered code. Which means, a lot of stuff was mocked.

Now, I'd like to know three things.

1. Your experiences in a similar area?
2. Is there some scientific background to code coverage and it's outcome?
3. What are some good arguments to lower the expected unit test code coverage?

4153,2020-04-15 16:18:41,75,76,"Hello Reddit!

With great pleasure and incredible stage fright I present to you my first publicly released library: [Introspectable](https://source.perfectable.org/nivertius/introspectable). This is a ""commons"" library that makes annoying and ugly java reflections a little more pleasant (I hope).

Library provides methods for finding java elements by reflection using ""queries"". For example:

    introspect(target.getClass()).methods()
        .named(""apply"")
        .parameterCount(1).returningVoid()
        .excludingModifier(Modifier.STATIC)
        .stream();
    
It simplifies creating proxy objects:

    ProxyBuilder.ofInterface(UserService.class)
        .instantiate(invocation -&gt; { 
            logger.logInvocation(invocation);
            invocation.withReceiver(actualUserService).invoke(); 
        });

But two of my favorite features are: 

`TypeView`, which is a wrapper on `java.lang.reflect.Type` and makes it usable - for example allows testing subtyping, which is, as I experienced, very tricky (ever wondered if wildcard type with lower bound is a subtype of the bound? now you can check it!). I spent hours and hours on research and testing and I hope I got it totally right (tests show that I might have some idea). [Section in README](https://source.perfectable.org/nivertius/introspectable#types)

The other cool feature is `FunctionalReference`. This allows constructing interfaces which can act as a 'method reference marker'. One part of the program implements the interface with method reference, and passes it to other, which can 'read' which method was actually referenced. This can replace passing 'class and method name as String' into something actually checked at compile time and refactorable. [Section in README](https://source.perfectable.org/nivertius/introspectable#functional-references). Example:

    @FunctionalInterface
    public interface Factory&lt;F, P&gt; extends FunctionalReference { // the marker declaration
        P build(F factory);

I've been working on this library on and off for years, using it in my other personal projects, and I think it reached maturity with version 4.0.0.

Introspectable is currently licenced with GPL 3.0, but I am thinking about changing it to something more permissive. I'm torn between LGPL and Apache Licence. I could use a advice in this matter.

I'm open to constructive criticism, additions, pull requests, non-constructive criticism, misc advice, optimisation suggestions, insults, new identifier naming suggestions, code reviews and whatever you can give me.","I just released my first library that helps with Java reflections, Introspectable"

For instance, one of our clients requires that we use their Java-based FTP server. a link is accessed which downloads a JNLP file to a user's PC. This JNLP file launches the FTP software. 

Another instance is that we use the third-party remote desktop software to connect to workstations from home. Some users need to run the Java applet to get it working, again, running through a JNLP file on their personal computer which launches the program. Most of these are licensed software which we or the client has paid for. 

With that being said, I'm still confused as to which version we need that doesn't require paying oracle to run these programs. I've spent that last few days reading so many different license-related articles that I think I have confused myself.

Hi all, I have started my data science with python journey for almost 6 months now, and most of the learning is done through jupyter notebook and console until I came across Plotly Dash. I am super excited about this tool, as it allows me to  build web app and deploy to server without any knowledge of html, css and so on. (So far, I only know python and a little bit of java)

  
I decided to build this Covid 19 dashboard as I am interested in global development and I wish to customized the dashboard to highlight data I am interested in.   
I have included the source code, as I am quite new to Plotly and Dash and I might not be following best practices, I hope to receive feedback on how I can improve in terms of anything and hope to learn from everyone.

 Lastly, I wish all of you, stay healthy and stay safe.

Arrays in Java can be adressed only with 32-bit indices, that means the maximum size of an array is around 2\*10^(9) elements. This is maybe inherited from the beginnings of java in 32-bit. Now we have 64-bit. So we could create bigger arrays and access them with a long.

I've follow this guide: [https://howtodoinjava.com/angular/rxjs-observable-httpclient/](https://howtodoinjava.com/angular/rxjs-observable-httpclient/)

It looks easy, but it's just not working for me.

Here's my code (from a component):

    providers = new Array&lt;Provider&gt;();
      constructor(APIService: HealthPairService)
      {
        APIService.getProviderAll().subscribe(response =&gt; {
          this.providers = response.map(item =&gt; {
            return new Provider(
              item.ProviderId,
              item.FacilityId,
              item.SpecialtyId,
              item.ProviderFirstName,
              item.ProviderLastName,
              item.ProviderPhoneNumber,
              item.Facility,
              item.Specialty,
              item.Appointments,
              item.Insurances
            );
          });
        });
      }

If I insert a console.warn(item), the objects are coming from the database just as they should.

But they're not being written to the array for some reason.

If I do the same console.warn for the providers array I get 3 separate empty arrays with zero length.

On the HTML side:

      &lt;table border=""1"" style=""width: 33%""&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Provider Id&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Provider First Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Provider Last Name&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr *ngFor=""let prov of providers""&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;{{ prov.ProviderId }}&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;{{ prov.ProviderFirstName }}&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;{{ prov.ProviderLastName }}&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;

I have this, and the information I'm expecting is not being displayed.

I also get 3 empty rows on the table, like the 3 empty arrays.

There are three entries in my table, so I feel like I'm pretty close on this one.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the problem with this data not being copied over as it should?

We definitely see it coming back from the http request when I do the console.warn(item).

The reason for me was that SparkJava seems to be dead so I have to check out some alternatives.

My first attempt was Ktor - and boy... documentation is sometimes wrong or incomplete and it took me quite a while to assemble the example. Ktor tries to avoid the SB-magic but replaces it with Extension-Function-magic. Extension-Functions are a really cool Kotlin feature but in my opinion they overused them in Ktor.

     * How cool ist this!

&gt;2. Classes and interfaces. These are ""symbols"". Example: the interface `List`

4253,2020-05-09 00:29:50,46,1,"Hello Guys,

I made a little game engine, which makes it really easy to create games in Java.

The engine offers quite a lot of features:

* Objects are seperated into GameObjects
* Sprites, Animated Sprites, Sounds
* KeyBoard and Mouse input
* A Camera System
* An easy to use file system
* Support for multiple rooms (scenes)
* TileSet system
* Physics
* and much more

There's soon going to be a **TileMap Editor** and a **Room Builder** for the engine aswell.  
I'm also in the making of several games using the CGGE2 GameEngine, including a Platformer and a FarmVille like game.

The engine also offers **full documentation** (in form of a PDF file) and full javadocs. 

I'd love to see a few games made with it and I'd especially love to see some **contributions** to it, so that we can make it even more feature complete and performant. I'm also open for any kind of critique as it helps me improve the engine even further.

The goal of the engine is ***EASE OF USE*** and ***USEFULNESS***.

Especially since I have no idea what to call it, it's a technique I've seen used in multiple already-developed-and-established open-source games I've taken up modding in.

So, I'm working on making a small RPG in the style of Pokemon or Final Fantasy (are all of them), in which you traverse an open world, and occasionally encounter enemies and enter a turn-based system. Got a good picture in your head?

I want to make a list of possible enemies (and collectible player units) which hosts variables like name, health, description, typing... which can be called via the whole block's name (not the name variable, but maybe they're the same names). 

For example, the game ""Mindustry"", (though written in Java and thus not entirely helpful) uses pretty much the exact system I want to use. It has a multitude of blocks defined in the code, which are either environment blocks (like a section of stone, or a deep treacherous body of water) or more ""functional"" blocks which the player can build with (like a conveyor belt, or a coal generator, or an electric-arc-using turret), and they're all defined in a couple different .java files like this:

        graphitePress = new GenericCrafter(""graphite-press""){{
            requirements(Category.crafting, ItemStack.with(Items.copper, 75, Items.lead, 30));
    
            craftEffect = Fx.pulverizeMedium;
            outputItem = new ItemStack(Items.graphite, 1);
            craftTime = 90f;
            size = 2;
            hasItems = true;
    
            consumes.item(Items.coal, 2);
        }};

at which point the code can refer to ""graphite-press"" and retrieve any of these variables.

That code is, as stated above, Java and not C#. Because I'm working with Unity, I have to use C# instead of Java. Does anyone know if this technique can be used in C#? (And, if so, how best to accomplish it? I want most to be able to define a single entity on multiple lines, within a set of curly braces. That's the goal.)","Pokemon- or Final Fantasy- style RPG enemy ""template"" feature?"

4288,2020-05-19 04:16:04,0,1,"Hi! =) 

In a personal project of mine, I'm looking to do my database integrations a little different than I've done until now. I wish to use reflection for runtime access to the function name and name of the class that function belongs to. The reason for that is I wish to remove any implementation details concerning both the actual logging and the query itself from the dao. So a sample query would in my mind look something like this:

    fun update(isFinished: Boolean) {
    val query = QueryFileReader.readSqlFile(::update)
    val parameters = MapSqlParameterSource().apply {
        addValue(IS_FINISHED, isFinished)
    }

        try {
        namedTemplate.update(query, parameters)
    } catch (error: Exception) {
        throw DataAccessException(::update, error)
    }
}

This is also my first time looking into reflection. What goes on here then?

* `QueryFileReader` attempts to read the contents of a file that belongs to the function through reflection (`KFunction&lt;*&gt;` *parameter type*). So it attempts to get a fully qualified name like `com.business.app.repository.customer.update` for instance. Then based on that name, it knows to look in `src/main/resources/db/queries/customer` for a file called `update.sql`.
* The `DataAccessException` takes two parameters. One is a `KFunction&lt;*&gt;` type and the other simply is the original exception. It then logs the exception to file, before it rethrows the exception as a custom one with a ""safe"" error message that the end user can see (*so I'm logging and hiding the original cause*). The idea is that based on the first parameter, it should (as the `QueryFileReader`) be able to get the proper error messages in a resourceBundle through reflection.

However, I haven't found a clean way to get both function name and class name through one parameter. It seems as though `KFunction` has no direct tie to the enclosing class (`javaClass.enclosingClass` is null quite often).

Am I going about this the wrong way? Any better way to achieve the same goal? Also, any obvious antipatterns here?",Experimenting with reflection to make database queries and logging simpler - feedback and suggestions appreciated

Hello,

I'm new to java and android studio. I'm trying to make a game in whac-a-mole style. The problem I have is that I don't know how to assign an image/icon for an object I have. To put it more specifically, my game consists of GREEN and YELLOW monsters. the yellow monsters are bad, so you have to click them in order to get rid of them, otherwise they turn into green or move somewhere else on the map. The green monsters are good and unclickable but they can turn into a yellow monster. I want to set an icon for my yellow and green monsters, but I don't know how to. I have read some infos about bitmaps or other stuff that could help but I don't quite know how to implement it on my code, like what is the version of using that for my code. This is why I posted it here, to be more specifical. I hoped you could help.

Bellow, I posted an image where I draw the canvas, the terrain in which monsters spawn. I suppose that I have to change something here in order to have an image for my monsters.

I use the [JetBrainsRuntime](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime) project and patch the `FTScalerContext`, so that all fonts can rendered with bold, just like what `embolden=true` do, and then you build your own JetBrainsRuntime with embolden font rendering :)

For custom application events, such as request handler invocation counts, request handler durations, error counts, etc. where does this make metrics libraries such as Micrometer fit in, as there seems to be some overlap? At a first glance the latter has a richer set of metric types (histograms, guages, etc.), and good integration to several systems such as Prometheus, JMS, Graphite, etc. I'm assuming the JVM JIT is smart enough (especially if the metrics library is written in a way to interact well with it) that it should have low overhead anyway when generating these events.

Like, Micrometer already provides [JVM system metrics](https://micrometer.io/docs/ref/jvm), similar to the JFR.

4322,2020-05-27 16:01:23,51,1,"**TLDR: All modern frontend development seems to be done using one of React, Angular or Vue. Does this mean using a java framework for your frontend is a bad idea, or is an outdated approach?**

I'm starting a new project at work and one of the tasks we've to do is setup a basic frontend for our application. Our backend is currently all written in Spring mostly with spring boot and deployed using docker and kubernetes. On our last project, we had a similar setup with our frontend built using Apache Wicket. Wicket was...interesting. Its documentation wasn't great, but once you got the hang of it, it wasn't too bad to use, but I would rather not work with it again if possible. 

That brings me to my current project. My team and org have never built good frontend applications. They always feel like they're UIs that belong in the 90s or early 00s. This is mostly because we are all backend java developers and none of us are UI/UX designers. I see nowadays that everybody seems to be using either React/Angular/Vue to build their frontends. The design convention seems to be that you develop  your backend all as REST APIs using whatever language you want, and then you call them via your frontend which is written in one of the aforementioned technologies. My question is really this, is their a benefit to doing this, over say using a Java UI framework like apache wicket, java fx, spring mvc etc.? 

I want to propose using some more modern frontend tools on this new project, but I don't have an answer to the questions I'm going to be asked by the project manager, which will be: 

1. ""What benefits are there to doing it that way?""
2. ""Why not use an existing java framework, since everyone on the team already knows java?""
3. ""Shouldn't the design be independent of the framework we use? Switching to something like React isn't going to make us better designers by default""

I don't really have answers to those questions, other than the fact that modern frontend development really seems to be done using these new JavaScript technologies, and if I googled what Java frontend framework to use, the results usually say that nowadays, you don't build them in Java.",Opinions on using Java for frontend development?

&gt; Returns the search path of URLs for loading classes and resources. This includes the original list of URLs specified to the constructor, along with any URLs subsequently appended by the addURL() method.

And the Kotlin documentation claims:

&gt; Methods that follow the Java conventions for getters and setters (no-argument methods with names starting with get and single-argument methods with names starting with set) are represented as properties in Kotlin. Boolean accessor methods (where the name of the getter starts with is and the name of the setter starts with set) are represented as properties which have the same name as the getter method.

Well, all righty then, I should have a .URLs property I can use. But no:

    res6: kotlin.Array&lt;(out) java.net.URL!&gt;! = [Ljava.net.URL;@5b6ac24b
    
Of course, the rule is that .getFoo() maps to a .foo property. Note the downcasing; the property on the Kotlin side is called .foo and not .Foo. So maybe it’s called .uRLs? Close, but no cigar!

    &gt;&gt;&gt; (cl as URLClassLoader).uRLs
    error: unresolved reference: uRLs
    (cl as URLClassLoader).uRLs

I recently decided to start programming in C# and i must say i really enjoy it .

I am an experienced java developer and just decided that its time to move on and pick up something new.

In the last few days i kept reading the documentation from microsoft , did some codewars katas and that all was pretty nice and fun since the syntax of java and c# are so similar i didn't have much problems finding the stuff i needed to accomplish my tasks or to write the code at all.

Nevertheless i am looking for a book which is containing all the information i need to get familiar with c# idioms , best practices and language features overall since i find myself trying to do things ""the java way"" and i really find it hard to get rid of this without any external instructions.

Preferably something with some tasks in it .It would be great if it would be close to the concept of the book ""the c++ programming language"" or ""learning python the hard way"" or something like that.

I have been surfing and searching for a few days now and i didnt really come to a conclusion about which book to pick up, so i decided to give this subreddit a try and ask if some of you guys got some first hand experience with switching from another language to C# ,or learning it as first language,with a book of your choice which you can recommend.

I appreciate any recommendations and will consider them all.

4336,2020-05-31 14:14:45,183,0,"At CppCon 2017, Bjarne's keynote address was in part on the need for C++ to have better support for new programmers, using the metaphor of difficulty settings on a camera, where you can set it to ""Auto"" (ironic) to get pretty good performance for most people, with an easy curve, and then more advanced settings for people who know what they're doing.

My personal interest in C++ is making it easier for new programmers (the myth that C++ is hard for newbies is a pet peeve of mine, but it also has some truth). Sort of like the Lorax, who speaks for the trees, I look at C++ from the perspective of someone who is coding in C++ for the first time.

One of the earliest topics covered in C++ is also one of the hardest to do right for new programmers: cin. Few new programmers are capable of inputting even a single integer using cin properly. By this I mean that they handle errors correctly (What if the user types ""squirrel"" instead of an integer? What if an EOF is received on the keyboard?), know how to clear the error flags and reprompt in a loop. Especially without just copy/pasting boilerplate code that they don't really understand.

For example, this is a typical way you'll see someone get three integers from the standard input:  

    int x,y,z;
    cin &gt;&gt; x &gt;&gt; y &gt;&gt; z;    

Why is this bad? An error could take place in any of the three inputs, causing a cascading failure (I'll talk about errors further below), and the seemingly innocuous fact that x, y and z are uninitialized, which *shouldn't* present a problem, *except when it does*. But people write code this way since the way cin works won't allow declaring a variable and initializing it from the keyboard on the same line. So a lot of paranoid/experienced programmers do this instead:

    int x = 0, y = 0, z = 0;
    cin &gt;&gt; x &gt;&gt; y &gt;&gt; z;

But this isn't great either, because we're setting a value on a variable that literally will never use that value. Ideally it will be discarded by the optimizer, but you're still typing code that should be discarded, which is cognitively nonsensical to new programmers.

From my personal experience, a lot of new programmers want to (and often try to) write code something like this:

    int x = cin, y = cin, z = cin;

Because then you can declare a value and initialize it from the keyboard at the same time. We can also do this with const variables, which is nice. Const, after all, doesn't mean compile time determinable, but rather immutable once set. But it is impossible to have cin &gt;&gt; work with const at all, since it can't be combined with a variable declaration.

Since C++11, const has become more and more important to us, and the inability to set a const variable using cin is, to me, enough impetus in and of itself to suggest we should have something in the standard library that would play nicely with the const-everything movement. For example, something like this from a small header library I wrote [here](https://github.com/ShakaUVM/read):

    const int ROWS = read&lt;int&gt;();

And since we're talking about modern C++ trends, there's also auto. I'm not a huge fan of the Auto Almost Anywhere movement, but the auto keyword has certainly been popping up a lot in modern codebases. And auto doesn't work with ""cin &gt;&gt;"" at all:

    auto x;
    cin &gt;&gt; x;
(This will not compile since auto x cannot deduce its type, and it can't even be made to work because cin can't appear on the right hand side of an assignment operation the way we need it to.) So we could do something like this and make the Auto Gang happy:

    const auto NAME = read&lt;string&gt;();

This way you don't need to specify the type twice, which is nice from a Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) standpoint.

The next major problem with ""cin &gt;&gt;"" is how it works, or doesn't work, when you mix cin &gt;&gt; with getline. (For those of you who don't know, cin &gt;&gt; will leave a trailing newline in the input buffer, causing the getline to return an empty string... but only the first getline.) I have seen this trip up... well, basically everyone at one point or another, but new programmers especially are baffled when their code seems to just non-deterministically not work.

The biggest problem with cin, however, is error checking. The main strength of cin, its design *raison d'etre*, is that it can chain together multiple input statements at once and then (hopefully the user will remember to) check for errors after:

    cin &gt;&gt; x &gt;&gt; y &gt;&gt; z;
    if (!cin) { ... }
The trouble is that this is very nearly always bad code. Except in the most trivial of programs, where you exit() if anything at all out of place happens, it is a very serious problem to not be able to tell which variable the input failed on. Does x have a valid value? y? Well, we know z doesn't. Since we don't know how many valid values have been successfully consumed from the input stream, we can't recover from it without the user's help.

Also because of the fact that once one input fails, all subsequent calls fail, without the programmer being very careful to vet their input (which most new programmers aren't) their code will typically explode and fall into an infinite loop the second the user enters anything that doesn't exactly match what their code is expecting. Cin results in fragile code.

So to combat these problems, new programmers typically hit up Stack Overflow and get pointed to boilerplate code [like this example from the FAQ](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/input-output#istream-and-ignore) that will let them recover from an erroneous input and reprompt:

        #include &lt;iostream&gt;
        #include &lt;limits&gt;
        int main()
        {
          int age = 0;
          while ((std::cout &lt;&lt; ""How old are you? "")
                 &amp;&amp; !(std::cin &gt;&gt; age)) {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; ""That's not a number; "";
            std::cin.clear();
            std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits&lt;std::streamsize&gt;::max(), '\n');
          }
          std::cout &lt;&lt; ""You are "" &lt;&lt; age &lt;&lt; "" years old\n"";
          // ...
        }

And they need to do this with every. single. integer. ever. read. from. cin. How many new programmers do you think can code that from memory? How many do you think will be diligent enough to copy/paste the code so that they can recover from an error on every input? And if they did, how horrible is their code going to look?

If you are ready to respond, ""Well, that should be wrapped up in a function"" then, well, I'm in agreement with you. My take on it [is here](https://github.com/ShakaUVM/read) on GitHub. I think we need something along these lines in std. 

**Standard libraries exist to make complex tasks simple, and common tasks easy.** Especially (again, from my perspective as the Lorax) for new programmers. What we have right now, and have dealt with since the 90s, is generations of new programmers not properly vetting their inputs, and *learning* to not vet their inputs since it's too complicated to memorize and too verbose for their code to look any good, which leads to ""teh hax"" down the line as they write code in production the same way they learned in school. 

I don't think we should remove cin or getline or any of the existing tools, but I do think we need an ""auto setting"" for new programmers for input.

[My header-only library](https://github.com/ShakaUVM/read) does the following things:

1. Handles prompting the user alongside the input, like how Python does it.
2. If you ask it for an int, by golly, *it will give you an int*. It will throw away input the user types in, clearing any errors, reprompting the user each time, until a valid int is read.
3. It allows freely mixing the ""cin &gt;&gt;"" and getline() analogues without bugs.
4. It allows you to declare a variable and initialize it from an input stream on one line, allowing more compact, sensible, readable, and safer code.
5. It allows you to use const with input
6. It allows you to use auto with input
7. It works with any type that has an operator&gt;&gt; and default constructor defined for it.
8. It's far less verbose than similar code in Java (http://java.util.scanner/) and is type safe, unlike the equivalent code in Python.
9. Returns an default object if it hits an EOF, otherwise it is impossible for it to leave the input stream in an error state, preventing cascading errors from multiple cins chained together.
10. It probably makes the functional people happy to have input treated as a normal function.

Compared to that giant block of code from the FAQ above, this is all a new programmer would have to write:

    int age = read&lt;int&gt;(""Please enter your age: "");
    cout &lt;&lt; ""You are "" &lt;&lt; age &lt;&lt; "" years old.\n"";

I've tried this out with new programmers, and unsurprisingly they like the more compact option.

Downsides? You lose the ability to manually handle error checking and recovery (it's an ""auto setting"", remember?), and you could also probably write a more performant version. But benchmarking it on a million ints, it has the same speed as the old way of reading data as long as the optimizer is on and ASAN is off. It will introduce angle bracket notation earlier than they'd probably normally encounter them, but new programmers seem to take it in stride.","We need to do better than ""cin &gt;&gt;"" for new programmers"

Those days are gone when you blindly prefer Java for android based projects. As time passed, Kotlin emerged as the tough competitor of Java for android development. Now it’s time to switch over Kotlin. It is not just about the popularity amongst the developers but also the advantages over Java. Before comparing Kotlin with java, Let see some basics of Kotlin-

### What is Kotlin?

 

Kotlin is developed by JetBrains, and was first released in 2016. Immediately after the launch, it has gained a lot of popularity among the android community. And it gained momentum when google announced Kotlin as a first-class language for developing Android apps at the I/O 2017.

When it comes to its usability, Kotlin has a set of tools and frameworks that work with Java. Its advanced compiler can check the errors during compile time and run time also. It also reduces the lines of code to a great extent. Kotlin has everything that developers need and couldn’t find in Java or any other alternative like JRuby or Groovy. It is concise and completely interoperable with Java. Also, Kotlin came with higher compatibility with Android Studio in which IntelliJ IDEA, JetBrains’ own Java IDE serves as the backbone. Know the best Kotlin server-side frameworks at- [**5 Best Kotlin Server-side frameworks**](https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/5-best-kotlin-server-side-frameworks/).

## What Is The Problem With Java?

Java was released 20 years ago. And hence each new version of Java has to be compatible with the previous version. It becomes a challenge to compete with newer, more concise, expressive programming languages. Java is still the official programming language for android development but it just starts to show its limitations and its age.

## Reasons To Use Kotlin Over Java-

 

### 1. Easy Code-

Kotlin programs are easy to code as it does not need semicolons in their program. Also, they have smart casts and string templates. Java is not a concise language and it increases the chances of bugs. Kotlin is a concise language that means having fewer chances of runtime and compile-time errors. Kotlin provides an easy way to use mutable and immutable declarations for different data structures.

### 2. Completely Interoperable With Java-

One of the biggest advantages of Kotlin is, it is compatible with java. With multiple ways, it can easily use and exchange information from Java. Code of Kotlin and Java can co-exist in the same project. Kotlin can perform well with Java programming language. You can use multiple java libraries in Kotlin projects and this makes it more compatible. Compatibility is not just about the libraries but also with some advanced frameworks. You can use easily use Kotlin from Java by just converting a complete project to Kotlin. This is the biggest advantage for developers that they do not need to learn a new language. Anyone who is proficient with Java can easily code in Kotlin.

### 3. More Concise Than Java-

Every Kotlin programmer is happy with this feature. Kotlin is a statically-typed language that is very easy to read and write. You can solve the same problem with fewer lines of code and this reduces the number of bugs and crashes on the UX side. Due to the fewer lines of code, it becomes-

* Easy to maintain, 
* Easy to read and 
* Simple to apply changes when required.

There are some Kotlin features that are responsible for its code conciseness are- Data classes,  Smart casts, Type interface, Properties

### 4. Smart And Safe Compiler-

One of the main goals of Kotlin’s development team was to add a good compiler. And here are some important aspects of the compiler in Kotlin-

* It performs a lot of efficient checks, decreasing runtime errors, and the bugs in code.
* It detects errors at compile time not at runtime, by using the “fail-fast” principle.

### 5. Easy To Maintain-

Kotlin supports a lot of IDEs including Android Studio hence It is a “one-stop language” for all application development. You can freely use all those you have already tried and tested development tools that you’re comfortable to maintain code. As the Kotlin possesses fewer lines of code, it is easy to maintain and work upon. This is one of the best advantages over Java.

### 6. Eliminating Null References:

The biggest advantage over Java is null references. Accessing a member of null reference results in a null reference exception and this is a significant drawback of Java called as NullPointerException or NPE. The type system of Kotlin is dedicated to eliminate NullPointerException from code.

The possible causes of NPE’s may be:

1. An explicit call to throw NullPointerException();
2. Usage of the !! operator;
3. Java interoperation:

* When try to access a member on a null reference of a platform type;
* Generic types used for Java interoperation with incorrect nullability, e.g. a piece of Java code might add null into a Kotlin MutableList&lt;String&gt;, meaning that MutableList&lt;String?&gt; should be used for working with it;

4. Some data inconsistency with initialization, when:

An uninitialized this available in a constructor is passed and used somewhere (“leaking this”);

A superclass constructor calls an open member whose implementation in the derived class uses uninitialized state;

### 7. Solution To Java’s Issue-

Old java has a lot of issues. It hinders a well-known issue of null pointer. Kotlin tried to solve these issues. To overcome difficulties of java, it has adopted things from multiple languages like C# and Scala. It has instances from the Pascal language and is considered as very influential in Kotlin’s development. Some of the elements such as parameter lists and variable declarations with data type following a variable could be in Kotlin. It eliminates the error by removing the boilerplate code. It has some features like late initializations, delegations and also addresses a type safety. Kotlin was easy to type wrongly typed variables to a list before generics came along. This would typically lead to blowing up during the run time because the compiler does not detect it.

### 8. Improves Productivity-

Kotlin has been built with developer productivity in mind and is the key advantage of Kotlin over Java. Also, it’s a given that improved productivity returns to concise code itself, including its natural syntax and its general clean language design. It will need less time to write new code, deploy it, and maintain it in Kotlin. Concise and clear code in Kotlin helps to improve the developers’ productivity. Kotlin has a lot of powerful features that accelerate development tasks. These features are-

* Object declarations
* Parameter values
* Extension functions

I've been into it for about six years but never had enough time so after each holiday I usually had no time for it until the next holiday. That's changed for the last nine months and a lot more since this whole lockdown thing began in my country since the end of March. I began with python and moved to learn java. I was able to learn and understand concepts like variables, loops, functions, object-oriented programming, etc. I moved to java because I wanted to find something that I could use what I  was learning on and I originally thought I wanted to go into android development. It ended up that I found out from that and my earlier experience with HTML and CSS that I only loved the programming and logical side of all this and I'm not really into UI design and all that since its not a set of instructions or formulae like things and I'm not really good at that.

The version 1.1.1-rc4 is the last release candidate before the official version (if there are not big bugs), to test this version I want open a little talk with community to talk some feature and if someone one test the library to send the feedback about it.

In the material-ui-swing-1.1.1-pre\_release6.1 I decided to give a name all release and maybe also meaning and in the preview I want to announce that the name of material-ui-swing-1.1.1 will be Gotham and the mascot will be Bane.

Meaning: The result of this version and also the support for the library on Github and for me (vincenzopalazzo) by the java community on Reddit help me to continue to learn and improve the library. This version contains all (or in part) suggestions from this community about the style and I don't know why but I think that the sentence inside ""Batman: The dark knight returns"" can use to express the work of this version of the library.

I'm working on a little weather app and it's my first time dealing with JSON. At the moment my app is almost working as intended, I'm just having problems trying to take this Json information from openweathermap into my data objects. Sorry if the terminology I'm using isn't quite correct too.  


My only problem is the weather part of the json info.

    {
     ""coord"":{""lon"":-0.13,""lat"":51.51},
     ""weather"": [
     {
         ""id"":803,

         ""icon"":""04d""
     }
     ],
     ""base"":""stations"",
    

This is the only part of the full Json that has a \[ {} \] in it. This is making me think it wants an array of info?

&amp;#x200B;

My WeatherData class is extensive so I'll just list the problem bit in it. It references another class 'Weather' as I've made classes for any part of the Json that has { } in it and it seems to be working great when I comment out the Weather bit in my constructor.

    data class WeatherData(val coord: Coord, val weather: Weather, val base: String //more stuff )
    
    data class Weather(val id: Int, val main: String, val description: String, val icon: String)

What I feel like I want to do is something like, val weather: arrayOf{Weather}.

  
The error I get is 

    com.google.gson.JsonSyntaxException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Expected BEGIN_OBJECT but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 1 column 47 path $.weather

Just quickly wanted to say thanks again to the guys that helped me out a few days ago, thanks this sub :D

I'm getting the following error message when I try to add some new values to a text view on my app.

    android.view.ViewRootImpl$CalledFromWrongThreadException: Only the original thread that created a view hierarchy can touch its views.

The strangest thing is that this problem sometimes happens, and sometimes doesnt.

I'm running it within an overriden onResponse() method within a OkHttpClient. Everything has been working great, but now it's gotten to a point where I can't add any more values to my weather app without the app crashing.

Some examples of code that works currently:

    threeDay.text = getNextDay(twoDay.text.toString())
    threeWeather.text = weatherData.daily[2].weather[0].main
    cityText.text = getLocalLocation(weatherData.timezone)
    weatherSummaryText.text = weatherData.current.weather[0].description

And then some error code, which when I test in a println method gives me exactly the value I want:

    nowTemp.text = kelvinToCelsius(weatherData.hourly[0].temp).toString()
    oneTemp.text = kelvinToCelsius(weatherData.hourly[1].temp).toString()

Where kelvinToCelsius is just a converter method I made.

Can anyone give me any insight into this strange problem?

4428,2020-06-26 17:44:27,2,1,"Little backstory/context:
Roughly 6 years ago just after finishing school, me and a couple of friends took a short coding class consisting of a bit of full stack (css, html, java script and php) and a bit of game dev (c#). Now I've come to the realisation that I may have been 'too young' to enjoy and/or appreciate learning to code, and a packed classroom full of distractions didn't quite help either.

Progression:
What I want to become is a Web/full stack developer, eventually transitioning to app development. 

I see my progression going something like this:
1. Get a hang of the basics.
2. Get proficient and comfortable with creating good looking interactive frontend websites.
3. Experiment with the backend; admin panel, hooking up basic and complex databases, integrating APIs etc.
4. Eventually transitioning to Android/iOS app development.

I am now looking for recommendations as to which coding language to stick to. I was thinking C# (and the obvious CSS, HTML) as from researching it looks like it can handle both frontend and backend development alongside both Android and iOS development. And it kind of looks less complicated than PHP which I kinda found difficult to learn. 

Is C# a good choice for what I want to accomplish? Or would something like Java with the Angular framework be better? 

Do you guys think it's worth sticking to 1 language like C# and getting proficient at using it in all aspects, or alternating between a few different ones?

Also, does anyone have any experience with learning to code from sites like Udemy or others? Any recommendations on what I should start on, Like learning CSS, HTML, Bootstrap first, then C#?",Want to start Web dev and Android/iOS apps

The problem I'm seeing is that if I wanted to do anything with my weatherData value, I can only access it from within this method. This causes problems for future things I have in mind such as swiping to a new location and repopulating the data with a new URL, or sending notifications to the app with snippets of weather details.

So my question is it possible to move this all to some kind of higher level function maybe? (sorry thats probably wrong terminology.) I'd really like to just have this class of weather data, to be used at any point throughout my application. Is that possible?

4451,2020-07-03 22:15:53,4,2,"I have been working on a Kotlin App using Spring Boot and GraphQL with all my data stored in a MongoDB database. I have started using the GraphQL-Java-Extended-Scalars to try to deal with my DateTimes in my Database but it keeps throwing the error Expected something we can convert to 'java.time.OffsetDateTime' but was 'LocalDateTime'.  I was wonder how do you correctly setup GraphQL-Java-Extended-Scalars and what data type should I use for my DateTimes?

My GraphQL Schema is set up like this: 

    scalar DateTime
    scalar Date
    
    type Query {
       users: [User]
    }
    
    type User {
      id: ID!
      username: String!
      password: String!
      email: String!
      dateOfBirth: Date
      dateCreated: DateTime!
    }

I defined the custom mapping and extended scalars like this: 

    @Component
    class scalars() {
    
    
    @Bean
    fun objectMapper(): ObjectMapper? {
        return ObjectMapper().registerModule(JavaTimeModule())
                .disable(SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS)
    }
    
    @Bean
    fun schemaParserOptions(): SchemaParserOptions? {
        return SchemaParserOptions.newOptions()
                .objectMapperProvider(PerFieldObjectMapperProvider { fieldDefinition: FieldDefinition? -&gt; objectMapper() }).build()
    }
    
    @Bean
    fun date(): GraphQLScalarType? {
        return ExtendedScalars.Date
    }
    
    @Bean
    fun datetime(): GraphQLScalarType? {
        return ExtendedScalars.DateTime
    }
    }

Then  I created the user object with these data type set up: 

    @Document(collection = ""users"")
    data class UserEntity(
        var username: String,
        var password: String,
        var email: String,
        var dateOfBirth: LocalDate,
        var dateCreated: LocalDateTime
     ) {
        @Id
        var id: String = """"
     }

and lastly, my DateTime in the MongoDB database is in this form: 

    ""dateCreated"" : ISODAte(""2020-0703T:30:52.237Z"")

Hopefully, this is information to help solve the error it keeps throwing when I run the query for dateCreated of the user. Thank you for all your help in advance",Kotlin Spring Boot throws an error getting a DateTime out of a MongoDB Database using Graph-QL Java

If that is the case, is there a way to force svcutil to generate everything? Or could there be another reason why it doesn't generate these classes?

I am making an exe of my python 3.7 script with nuitka on Windows 10.

My script need to run some sdkmanager and npm commands before to run properly.

It also auto-install Java and add the environment variable.

As you know, my exe cannot enjoy the freshly new environment variable if it is not retarted.

So my exe restart itself, it can read and display the new environment variable... but when some commands run (which needs Java), it bugs saying « java was not found ».

But if I restart myself my exe, it will enjoy the JAVA environment variable and the commands are not bugging anymore and everything seems to be fine.


So I decided to make a separate exe which install all the stuff, add the environment variables and call my main exe. I still have the same issue.

I use some script to propagate the environment variable but I still have the same issue. 

Does anyone has a solution please for this kind of issue?

The only thing i felt bad about is a bit of clutter-ish overhead that i got when i had to explicitly defone an interface. So i though what if java/compiler/some tool could automagically create an implicit interface for a class and its public methods and the class implicitly implements that interface. Wouldnt it be great? Maybe even if it did that by default for all classes that dont already implement/extend something. And then call this interface something like ""I&lt;classname&gt;"".

I recently enrolled in Svetlana Isakova @ JetBrains' excellent coursera course ""Kotlin for Java developers"" I found it supremely informative and though I have not finished yet, I was motivated enough to complete 4.5 of the five weeks of material in just a few days. While I am used to Java and personally do not like using some other languages like python, I could immediately see the great advantages that Kotlin offers. I have decided to list some of my top 5 reasons to use Kotlin so that others may be swayed.

1. Java interoperability. Kotlin can be used with java code in a project directly, can be seamlessly converted to from java and can use any Java library.

2.:Runs on JVM, Android, JavaScript(!) and native executables on certain platforms. You can use it everywhere you can use java and beyond.

3.:It's clean and concise. Seriously, it is just so much more compact. On occasions I've been able to condense 20 lines of java into 4 lines of Kotlin. I think that speaks for itself.

4.: Functional And Oop. I think Kotlin strikes a great balance between a pure functional style as seen e.g. in Haskell and a classic Object oriented approach like I was familiar with from Java and c#. Depending on your preferences, you can use both styles. I think this aids a great deal in transitioning to the language.

5. Easy to learn from a Java background. As I have already said, I went from knowing literally nothing in Kotlin to a rather respectable level in just a few days. Transposing and transferring prior knowledge from Java to Kotlin works seamlessly and if you forget how to do something in Kotlin, you can just write it in java and either use the java code directly or convert it to Kotlin code.

That is the kind of thing I want to re-create with GraphQL. I want to spin up my full Spring container and use GraphQL queries to read/write from/to the database, and then validate that the operations succeeded.

I'm really struggling to figure out how to do this. I'm not posting any code here because all I know so far is MockMvc doesn't seem to see the GraphQL endpoint.

This is very broken and doesn't work. For starters it's like the dependencies get ignored. With my MPP attempted build.gradle.kts whenever I go to my code there are errors everywhere because the dependencies aren't properly build handled. Another issue I'm facing is the fact nothing is being shaded in the jars (Because dependencies are being ignored). The last issue I'm dealing with is that this MPP build.gradle.kts creates 3 jars instead of 1, before it just created  Ride-1.0.0.jar but now it creates  Ride-1.0.0.jar, Ride-jvm-1.0.0.jar, and Ride-metadata-1.0.0.jar.

4572,2020-08-09 20:45:37,7,1,"Hi!

I have a simple question but I do not know whether there is an answer.

When defining an anonymous class you can let the object inherit from multiple interfaces. The object has then both types like every (non anonymous) class that inherits from more then one interface.

    interface First {
     fun runFirst()
    }
    
    interface Second {
     fun runSecond()
    }
    
    fun test() {
     val both = object : First, Second {
            override fun runFirst() {
              println(""first"")
            }
    
            override fun runSecond() {
              println(""second"")
            }
        }
    
     // MainKt$test$both$1
     println(both.javaClass.typeName)
     
     // first
     // second
     both.runFirst()
     both.runSecond()
    }

My variable `both` in the given example is implicitly typed. But what is the Type? IntelliJ says `&lt;anonymous object: First, Second&gt;`. The JVM type name seems to be `MainKt$test$both$1`. The obvious way to solve this problem is to introduce a new interface:

    interface Both: First, Second

But then I could simply make it a non anonymous class instead of an interface.

Is there even a way to explicitly declare ""anonymous types""? I am excited to hear your thoughts on this.",Is there a way to define a type explicit and anonymous?

Apparently, since Java 11 the newest version of JavaFX is no longer included with JDK.

I installed JDK 14.something and was able to compile my program with the external JavaFX library no problem.

But, when I went to run it with Java MyTest it said it can't run classes compiled from newer versions of Java.

OK, I thought, I just need to update JRE to be 14.something so they match.

But JRE version numbering is all over the place and I have absolutely no idea how to find the latest version. The Java updater completely fails, because it can't uninstall 10.0.1 for whatever reason.

Following various links and search results for ""latest jre windows"" I some how ended up installing 1.8, 8.something and 9.something.

I've found that i learn best when i make projects, So as a learning experience i decided to make a URL Shortener using Flask. So i came up with a dumb name (Slic3) and got to work.

It's about as bare-bones as these things can get. You give it a URL, It validates it with a regular expression i copied from the internet because i couldn't figure out how to do it myself plus i've always been terrible with regular expressions even in other languages. It looks up the URL in it's database\* If it finds it, It returns that shortened url, And refreshes it's timestamp, Otherwise it creates a new short url, Adds it to the database, and returns that.

The short URL's last 24 hours\*, After which they are purged from the database.

There's also a little statistics page that shows you some stats and let you view the CSV file. The site claims it's for transparency, But its really a debug feature i decided to keep in for kicks.

*\*It doesn't actually use a database per se, In the interest of simplicity i just store everything in a CSV file.*

*\*It's roughly 24 hours because it ""purges"" the database of expired links once every hour.*

&amp;#x200B;

The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/veethree/slic3), And it's currently hosted on [pythoneverywhere](http://veethreedev.pythonanywhere.com/).

So I’ve spent the last 6 months devising my own solution.

It’s still in development, some parts only support maven and Java8, but I plan to remove these limitations eventually. Still, I’ve been using it daily for more than a month now, and it usually works fine, so I figured it’s time for a first release.

I’ve set it to run every time I save a file, and it has made my life much easier. Hopefully someone else can find use in it! It’s full of rough edges, so any bug report, request or simple feedback would be appreciated.

I am interested in the state of running java on FPGAs. I've heard about some cross-compilers? Are they working?

&amp;#x200B;

I use verilog at the moment, but I am interested in any experiences using java. I looked at JOP to execute JVM code directly on the FPGA, but I guess that makes only sense, if you write the performance-critical methods in some form of HDL, because I don't see much performance gain otherwise?

So, I write C++ and occasionally some Java (a desktop Swing application) for a living. Been thinking about trying out Kotlin for a while, finally found a reason: Compile &amp; patch [https://github.com/manuelsc/HDDFs-MPG-Dumper](https://github.com/manuelsc/HDDFs-MPG-Dumper)

I got to say, Kotlin kicked my ass today. It wasn't even the language that did it for me. It's Maven and the build tools. The IDEs did not help.

So I tried Eclipse, loaded in the Kotlin plugin, made a Kotlin project, set it as a Maven thingy and BAM, Kotlin dependencies disappeared. WTF. Mind you I've never used Maven (I'm quite happy with Ant, and I loath Make, MsBuild is pretty bad). Googled for help, found a terrible tutorial. Decided that maybe Eclipse's shitty Kotlin-Maven support was a sign I should try something else.

So I looked at the .gitignore file, it mentioned IDEA project files, so I'm like ""welp it's about time I tried out Intellij again"" I've used Eclipse for all of my Java development (it's the only thing Eclipse is good at). The nice thing about Eclipse is you can mostly ignore dependency problem, just put the jars in a folder and pull them into the project dependencies. What you see is what you get. Unless I completely missed it Intellij, completely lacks anything remotely useful to help new users out with Maven. I've been thrown into the deep end of Maven. Finally dropped the dependencies in and... The Maven Central site Intellij tried to pulled the dependencies from didn't have it. I couldn't even figure out what to google for that one.

So I went back to Eclipse, made a new project, not a Maven Project, and downloaded the jars from Maven Central, added them as dependencies to the Java project, Eclipse was happy. No errors, no unhappy squiggles. And then I tried to launch it. org.jetbrains.kotlin.ui.console is like ""ERROR: Unresolved reference: java (3, 8)"" along with pages more of errors like it can't find jack shit. Regular console is like ""Error: Could not find or load main class MainKt""

4654,2020-09-06 16:07:09,39,1,"In the current version of sealed classes in Java 15, whenever you have a sealed class or interface, you declare which classes are permitted to extend or implement it.

```
public sealed interface Computer permits Laptop, Desktop, CellPhone {}
```

And then the classes which extend that sealed class must either declare that they are `final`, with no more extension allowed.

```
public final class Laptop implements Computer {}
```

That they are `sealed` again, meaning this subclass also has a restricted set of subclasses.

```
public sealed class Desktop implements Computer permits BudgetPC, GamingPC {}
```

Or that they are `non-sealed`, which means that they can be subclassed arbitrarily.

```
public non-sealed class CellPhone implements Computer {}
```

My issue is that in normal situations with java, `final` means ""No extension"" and no modifier already means ""arbitrary extension allowed"".

```
public class CellPhone implements Computer {}
```

So it would be unambiguous to just have no modifier at all.

While I understand that other JVM languages have trended towards final classes by default and requiring some sort of keyword like `open` to say that they are open for extension, the rest of Java does not have this behavior which makes this really stand out.

I know the language designers must have taken this into account and probably erred on the side of making people explicitly choose the behavior they want, but as much of a bikeshed as it is I really wish the language maintained symmetry.",Does anyone else not like the non-sealed keyword?

4667,2020-09-09 08:56:35,0,1,"**How we built Localazy CLI, command-line friendly software localization tool for smart&amp;lazy developers.** 

We thought about the right solution that would enable other developers to use Localazy on all platforms. We wanted to keep the developer-friendly / developer-centric approach and CLI, aka the command line interface, was the logical answer. 

We wanted **Localazy CLI** to be supported on all major platforms. Ideally, we wanted no dependency on Java or Node as those usually mean a huge binary or giant virtual machine. Small and fast binary for a given operating system looked like a perfect solution.

Kotlin is already heavily used at Localazy, and it powers the whole backend. And so [*Kotlin MPP*](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/mpp-intro.html) was a logical choice to look at for this task. It allowed us to write a single codebase for native Linux, macOS, Windows and Java in a programming language we know well.  


Almost all the code is shared between platforms and written in pure Kotlin. There were only two platform-dependent features - filesystem access and HTTP communication.

The filesystem access is quite simple, and we just create an actual implementation for Java (using java.io.File and streams), Linux/macOS (using POSIX) and Windows (slightly modified POSIX as there are small differences on Windows).

For HTTP communication, good old *HTTPUrlConnection* is used for Java and *ktor client* for Linux, macOS and Windows. The prototype of CLI was ready in a couple of days, and with a bit of fine-tuning, we were able to compile it to Java’s JAR and native binary for Linux, macOS and Windows.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Thanks to JetBrains for Kotlin, it was fun to write the CLI, and it works smoothly on all platforms.

We've built an open source library for adding authorization (permissions, roles, etc.) to Java apps, called oso. You write policies using the oso policy language to govern who can do what inside your application, then you integrate them with a few lines of code using our library. Under the hood, it's a policy engine that's embedded in your application.

Roles are a common pattern to reach for when setting up permissions, but we've found that they're limited and can get clunky, so oso provides a language (called *Polar*) that's purpose-built for representing common domain concepts that can be useful like data ownership, hierarchies, relationships, etc.

You can use oso in any Java application, and we made a tutorial for using it in Spring Boot ([https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/application/index.html](https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/application/index.html)).

4702,2020-09-16 09:54:47,39,1,"This is a thread following [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/i0i0e4/constexpr_if_and_requires_expressions_changed/) and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/i15g4p/c_has_become_easier_to_write_than_java/fzuq0jp/?context=3).

There's an emerging modern cpp subset, I personally call it ""CppScript"", that closely resembles the coding style of most popular dynamically typed languages. consider the following Python program:

    class TypeA:
        def f(self):
            return 'TypeA'
        def g(self):
            return 'Hello!'
        
    class TypeB:
        def f(self):
            return 'TypeB'
        
    def Test(obj):
        if hasattr(obj, 'g'):
            print(obj.f() + ' says ' + obj.g())
        else:
            print('g() is missing from ' + obj.f())
            
    Test(TypeA())
    Test(TypeB())

Below are the corresponding C++ programs that accurately replicates the behavior of the Python program above, in different versions of C++ (I have also tried to further downgrade from C++11 to C++98 but I failed because SFINAE seems exceptionally hard in C++98, I can't figure out the syntax to describe `decltype(&amp;T::g)` in C++98):

C++20: [https://godbolt.org/z/xG5v4s](https://godbolt.org/z/xG5v4s)

C++17: [https://godbolt.org/z/v9nY9P](https://godbolt.org/z/v9nY9P)

C++14: [https://godbolt.org/z/5Eh1Mv](https://godbolt.org/z/5Eh1Mv)

C++11: [https://godbolt.org/z/961dnY](https://godbolt.org/z/961dnY)

as you can see, the C++20 version is bit-identical (by ""bit-identical"", I mean each line of the C++ code **directly** corresponds to a line of the Python code above) to the Python code and as the C++ version gets older, the code gets more intricate and the coding style gradually deviates from the script looking Python/C++20 to more traditional template metaprogramming.

The CppScript subset of modern C++ is very easy to learn and write, you just need to follow these rules:

1. `auto` everywhere, this is not that much about ""I just don't bother with typing the types"", `auto` is essential to duck typing and letting your code ***automatically*** generalize to any compatible type.
2. favor duck typing (static polymorphism) over dynamic polymorphism (type erasure + virtual functions) whenever possible. This is because C++ is after all, statically typed, and the type information is either mostly erased (if RTTI is enabled or if there's any virtual function) or completely erased at runtime, therefore any functionality that relies on runtime type information will be very limited. many extremely powerful features including duck typing and dependent types are compile time only for C++ and you will want to take advantage of these features.
3. Don't overcomplicate things with a million classes and design patterns, use `requires` expressions and `constexpr if` if you want to query the behavior of something and change the behavior of your code accordingly.
4. Think in dynamic typing, but be aware that any type related stuff must be determined at compile time. You don't need a highly constrained mindset like you do for other less permissive statically typed languages like Java. C++ is very flexible at compile time, for instance, functions (function templates to be precise) could have return values of potentially different types, as long as the exact return type is reachable at compile time.

&amp;#8203;

    template&lt;auto x&gt;
    auto f() {
        if constexpr (x == 0)
            return 42;
        else
            return 2.71;
    }
    f&lt;0&gt;(); // returns int
    f&lt;1&gt;(); // returns double

personally I don't see a huge gap between the CppScript subset and dynamically typed languages like Python for most use cases, and I think it's a great startpoint for anyone that struggles to learn C++, it is much simpler, easier and more intuitive than the rest of C++",CppScript: the evolution of modern C++

• You are creating a small sandwich shop. The shops sells two items:

• Sandwiches are $6.50 each

• Salads are $4.50 each

• Write a program that displays a menu of the items available. The menu has three options: “sandwich”, “salad”, “end program”

• Give each menu option a number, the user should enter in the number

• If the user enters in an invalid number, display an error message and ask the user to reenter the menu option

• If the user enters in the “end program” option, display a goodbye message

• Write a program that displays a menu of the items available. The menu has three options: “sandwich”, “salad”, “end program”

• If the user enters in “sandwich” or “salad” ask the user how many they want to purchase

• If the user enters in a number that is less than or equal to zero, display an error and require them to reenter the number

• Once the user has entered a valid number, the program calculates the cost of the order and displays a message with the item purchased, the number of items purchased, and the cost of the purchase

• The program redisplays the menu and allows additional ordering. The program will continue running until the user specifically selects the “end program” option.

• Comment your code. Make sure there is a comment for every block

4709,2020-09-19 23:21:05,38,1," Before I learned about the use of an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) (Object-Relational Mapping), I handled all interactions with the database through either stored procedures or building a query and setting up parameters. It was not the most exciting part of development. When I was introduced to NHibernate, an ORM for .net based on Hibernate, an ORM for java, I jumped right in and started bringing it into my projects.

There are hundreds of different ORMs. The goal of most ORMs is to abstract interactions with the database, support multiple databases, and handle mapping. Some implementations also extend the base database functionality by adding caching, lazy loading, and bulk operations, to name a few. The most common denominator of these ORMs is that they generate SQL statements for you. Some do this through their own query language which could be string-based (HQL), or through methods that build the request internally.

In the past few years, I have completely moved away from using ORMs in my personal projects and when I have to work with ORMs, I am very cautious. I know SQL well enough to know what good SQL looks like. I’m also always having to work extra hard to ensure that the generated SQL performs well. ORMs can generate beautiful SQL, but it can also generate statements that are overly verbose and slow.

I’m not here to say that ORMs are evil and you must always stay away from them. I’m here to show the issues that using an ORM can bring to light. I want to start with the abstraction most ORMs provide. Abstraction is an amazing thing. ORMs use abstraction to provide a common API that can speak to different database flavors. The abstraction is what excited me at first. I thought being able to swap out the database with minimal changes to the code was amazing. I’ve used the ability to swap out a database, my use-case being that I wanted the ability to do unit testing against an in-memory database. It was pretty great, at least that was my opinion at the time.

Abstraction is not a bad thing. It can speed up development by dealing with most of the inner workings of database interactions. Where abstraction becomes a problem is that it is generating SQL for you. It is true that this opens the door for developers that are not comfortable with SQL, it forces developers to learn the ORM. Each ORM has a learning curve and each has its own API to interact with the database. This can cause developers to focus on the ORM, not the SQL it is generating. To be good at an ORM, I believe you not only need to understand the SQL it is producing, but you also must know how to use the API to get it to build the SQL you need it to produce. Most ORMs do allow you to write your own SQL, but that is typically not recommended, especially for the more opinionated ORM frameworks. There have been too many times that I have struggled to get ORMs to build SQL the way I need it. I typically find myself falling back to straight SQL for complex queries. ORMs are usually great at creating simple queries but when you need something more advanced, it can be tough to get what you need out of it. End of the day, my issue with the abstraction that ORMs provide is that they hide SQL. This can become a crutch for some people as they put off learning SQL and instead learn the ORM. If you need to switch to another language or system that uses a different ORM, you now need to learn the new ORM.

In my experience, to properly use most ORMs, you have to adapt your system to use it, which can become very invasive, requiring you to have to follow specific patterns to even use it. Some require you to use their own query language, others require you to build your objects with metadata. which is used to handle mappings. These are not bad things, but the more code you have to tailor to the ORM, the harder it is to replace it if you need to. Of course, you can abstract an ORM by isolating it and putting as much as you can behind interfaces but in my opinion, external dependencies such as a database should almost always be abstracted, especially if you want to bring in unit testing that does not actually hit the database.

I am a fan of almost anything that simplifies and speeds up development. Yes, ORMs do exactly that, but sometimes the way they do it can cause pain in the long run. I believe that anyone who uses an ORM should understand SQL well enough to understand the SQL that is generated. I also want to caution when using more advanced ORM features such as lazy-loading. These features can provide a lot of value but they can also cause unintended side-effects. I’ll never forget a bug that took too much time to track down. I was handling an object returned from NHibernate that had quite a few other table dependencies that were set up for lazy-loading. You could force the loading of the data at the time of the queries execution or you can let the ORM query the extra data when you need to use it. An example could be a User table. A user might have one or more roles. You would get a user object from the ORM and when you access that objects roles property, the ORM will execute an additional query to load that uses roles. This can be an awesome feature that can provide huge performance boosts. That said, it can also cause issues if your lazy-loading loads other lazy-loaded data. My bug was just that. Because of all of the lazy-loading, the state of my object and its properties were hard to debug. My issue ended up being that the state of the object didn’t always reflect the state of the database, especially as other processes were interacting with the same underlying data, changing the state of my dependencies as I accessed the lazy-loaded properties.

I’m taking my stab at creating an ORM for Typescript that is extremely lite and using its helpers is completely optional. I would say I’m about 60% done and I hope to finish it by October. I’m naming it nORM which stands for no ORM. when I’m ready, I’ll publish it to GitHub and create an NPM package.",ORM or not

In my previous approach in python I used some kind of 3D visualization toolkit(vedo) that made the whole creation of  lots of 3D primitives and a window quite easy because it did all the very detailed graphics stuff for me. The python approach was way to slow (not just the visualization but the whole algorithm).

I just had to initialize a new plotter and add cube primitives to it and then say plotter.show.  everything was really easy.

*TL;DR: trying to get a job but keep failing at pair programming interviews over and over. Don't know what to do and am considering leaving the tech industry to seek something else out of frustration.*

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start with a little bit of background so you can understand where I'm coming from. I started out as a web/java developer(4\~ years exp)  then became an Android developer (5+ years exp) and have led small sized Android teams over the last 2.5years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I lost my job in late March. Over the last 3 months I have been aggressively looking for a job but I seem to keep failing in the technical department when it comes to pair programming interviews. Though, I must say that I feel a lot more confident when I'm given one of those take-home tests where I feel like I can excel without being judged or something but that doesn't seem to be the case nowadays as 90% of the companies I've interviewed with thus far didn't do it. Out of all the companies I interviewed with, 4 of them I managed to get to very last step of their hiring process. But like you'd guess, they turned me down in the end. I tried to practice more, going to those code challenge websites along with working on my own small project to try and keep my mind sharp but that also doesn't seem to help at all. With that being said, like the title says, I keep failing at pair programming interviews and I don't know what to do about it anymore and decided to take it to the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

As a matter of fact, I do understand how software architecture works and what purpose they serve (MVVM for instance) and I can talk about it for hours because I really find it interesting. Not to mention the new Google Jetpack APIs etc. But for some weird reason my mind blacks out when in that scenario.  


Lastly, what really intrigues me too is the fact that I see so many developers getting new jobs within weeks and I'm really starting to feel that I might've just ""got lucky"" so far in my career and that I might not be as good as I thought I was to begin with. I'm actually considering completely deserting the industry altogether to pursue something else instead.

I'm confident in my practical and analytical skills, my teammates and managers never had a problem with me and feedbacks are always on a level of ""meets/exceeds expectations"", and companies themselves are known companies, so it's not like ""Yeah, whatever. Let's take this random guy and give him good title""

But for the last few months, I had some kind of fear, that if I'll lose my job because of COVID-19, I might have a hard time finding a new one, because I suck at theory. I've tried to study it again, but a few days later, I just forget it again, and I have to reread everything over and over again.

Are there any suggestions from you? Maybe there's someone who had similar issues, but managed to overcome it?",I'm a senior Java dev that sucks at theory and I need help (not a programming help)

Just randomly got a link yesterday to do some challenge question. Completed level 1 without breaking a sweat. Level 2 seems easy too but my code satisfies all the test cases that I can think of except for google(even the non hidden ones), and I have 1 day left. (long post ahead)

Problem: 

Power Hungry
============

Commander Lambda's space station is HUGE. And huge space stations take a LOT of power. Huge space stations with doomsday devices take even more power. To help meet the station's power needs, Commander Lambda has installed solar panels on the station's outer surface. But the station sits in the middle of a quasar quantum flux field, which wreaks havoc on the solar panels. You and your team of henchmen have been assigned to repair the solar panels, but you'd rather not take down all of the panels at once if you can help it, since they do help power the space station and all!

You need to figure out which sets of panels in any given array you can take offline to repair while still maintaining the maximum amount of power output per array, and to do THAT, you'll first need to figure out what the maximum output of each array actually is. Write a function solution(xs) that takes a list of integers representing the power output levels of each panel in an array, and returns the maximum product of some non-empty subset of those numbers. So for example, if an array contained panels with power output levels of [2, -3, 1, 0, -5], then the maximum product would be found by taking the subset: xs[0] = 2, xs[1] = -3, xs[4] = -5, giving the product 2*(-3)*(-5) = 30.  So solution([2,-3,1,0,-5]) will be ""30"".

Each array of solar panels contains at least 1 and no more than 50 panels, and each panel will have a power output level whose absolute value is no greater than 1000 (some panels are malfunctioning so badly that they're draining energy, but you know a trick with the panels' wave stabilizer that lets you combine two negative-output panels to produce the positive output of the multiple of their power values). The final products may be very large, so give the solution as a string representation of the number.

Languages
=========

To provide a Python solution, edit solution.py
To provide a Java solution, edit Solution.java

Test cases
==========
Your code should pass the following test cases.
Note that it may also be run against hidden test cases not shown here.

And I want to learn this as soon as possible because, I will start work on a very large kotlin/gradle project at work very soon.

1. create a kotlin project with gradle/kotlinDSL as build system
2. add the fuel (http client) as a dependency.
3. use fuel to make a http request.

At the moment I am stuck at ""adding fuel as a dependency"". In intellij, I added fuel as a dependency in project settings but still i keep getting ""unresolved reference""


Here are some of the problems I faced and does not seem straight-forward for someone that has been coding professionally for a long time, but is very new to the java ecosystem.

* couldn't find the one package manager. python has pypi. rust has crates. c# has nuget. So I naively assumed I would find something like that in the java/jvm/kotlin world. Oh boy, how wrong I was.
* theres like 10 different JDKs. I am not sure which one is the most used and which one I should use.
* confusion about what the JDK is. Is it the compiler , runtime and standard libraries. ?
* there is jscentral. maven central. and many others. Are they repositories of java libraries? kotlin libraries? or a combination of both.
* can i use any java libary with kotlin? Or are there some java libraries that won't work with kotlin? If so how do I tell if a java library will not work with kotlin
* are libraries restricted to working on only certain SDKs and not others?
* what is a module? can modules exist within other modules? In the c# world a solution can have many projects. Is it something like that?

I have so many other questions and If I seem frustrated, my apologies. I have been trying to get fuel added as a dependency and It just wont work. I've been trying to work this out for the past one day.

Otherwise, I think kotlin is a beauty. I just wish it was easier to understand the ecosytem.

But does it really matter? When recommending to a beginner they're not going to dealing with massive data sets with millions of pieces of information. 

Who cares if python is 0.01 seconds slower than Java? I find it mildly annoying when beginners are discouraged from python because in these top 10 videos, the host says it slow and everything and that person ends up taking C++ and quits programming altogether later that week, as I have seen a lot, even with my friends. Even I was discouraged from python several years ago, because people kept bashing it for the little stuff, so I ended up learning java, which made me pull my hair out in the beginning. 

I can perfectly understand if you are comparing the 2 languages speed to someone who has experience and may benefit greatly with C being a lot faster, but when recommending to a beginner, does it really matter?

I'm a sophomore computer science student and i wanted to talk about this struggle i seem to be going through lately with learning Java. First of all i wasn't sure if i should've posted this on r/learnjava since this isn't a technical question but if this doesn't belong here, pardon me. Anyways i have been studying computer science and been introduced to a wide range of technologies and some detailed aspects from a few branches of our industry such as hardware engineering, software development, robotics and data science, that allowed me to figure out exactly what career path i would like to choose on the long run to put food on my table. Currently i am very interested in writing/developing code in general. Even if it's a website or a native desktop program or a mobile application, anything that has code and works. I just love to build and know the mechanisms of a function that runs on a computer and being able to see it in action as it serves a meaningful purpose. When i started learning Java during my freshman year i was so engaged with learning a new concept of the language, using a new keyword and fascinated that i could explain my thoughts on a scientific matter in Java code. I just saw a huge mountain of knowledge of the Java SE platform and was eager to learn everything i could. I quickly noticed that i shouldn't rely on my university courses alone. I finally chose to learn Java specifically in depth by myself. After a few months i have been studying all summertime learning the standard platform of Java and can confidently say i have generally a good grasp of the language and the concepts that consist of it. Fast forward to now i am a bit lost into what to learn and where to apply my knowledge. I tried a few courses online continuing my journey with the Java EE APIs but i struggled understanding the technologies. Suddenly i was bombarded with acronyms and terms i never heard of such as REST APIs, Maven, Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Docker. I researched anything i could but i still lost track and couldn't keep up. I feel like i need some kind of road map to start from 0 and work my way up to understand the necessity and insides of these technologies. Everything on the internet from tutorials to courses seem a bit unorganized to me. I feel like i am in a dark cave with no map and no flashlight following any path that i find in front of me. Has anyone else felt like this especially all the self-learned developers, and how did you overcome this struggle. Any good general rule in learning languages that i don't know about?

The most common way to generate a human-readable UUID is doing the following:

If you use .toUUID() you can get the same result like this:

There's also a few more bells and whistles like generating UUIDs based on a collection, varargs, range of integers or even in a sequence.

4783,2020-10-15 10:10:03,0,1,"Recently, I have made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jb1dcm/is_there_any_documentation_for/) about kotlinx.serialization.properties and if there is any documentation. Turns out there apparently isn't, but the comments and my sourcecode-digging helped me out. The problem however is that KXS-properties is only capable of converting an object of an arbitrary model class into a **flat** `Map&lt;String, Any&gt;`, the keys already being in the correct format. Now there is still the last step needed, namely converting the map into a string that conforms the properties format (and vice versa). You might think that cannot be too hard, but it turns out that the [specification of the properties format](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.Reader)) is a lot more intricate than one might think.

I found a way to avoid writing the entire encoding / decoding on my own, just by using `java.util.Properties` and the `load()` and `store()` methods. To make this quick solution available to everyone, I created a public gist. If you need this functionality in your code, just copy paste the following:

https://gist.github.com/RaphaelTarita/748e02c06574b20c25ab96c87235096d

However, there are two major problems with this solution:

1. The usage of `java.util.Properties` makes the solution JVM-dependent. And this kinda kills the idea of KXS, which is mainly to be multiplatform. I'm currently considering to actually implement the encoding / decoding on my own, but it's gonna be tedious.

2. Right now, all values are mapped to their `toString()` results. Normally, you'd have to inject all custom serializers at this point, but I have no idea how to do this so that it does not involve runtime reflection. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Anyways, for now this Gist exists, despite the problems it has. So if you need to serialize a model class and encode it to a stringified `.properties` file (or vice versa), feel free to make use of this snippet.",First attempt at a StringFormat for KXS-properties

4799,2020-10-27 06:03:26,21,1,"According to the Tiobe index, C # and Java have been among the top five programming languages in the world for many years, and in a final race, C # and Java were simultaneously at the finish line. But none of them agreed to step aside in favor of the other.

This is why developers wonder which of these abilities is most useful for newcomers to learn.

So we decided to take a look at the C # and Java programming languages so that both you and the winner know where to start and which language is best for you.

**The birth story of the Java programming language**

One day, the engineering team of Sun Microsystems was sitting and drinking coffee, when suddenly one of the team members said, ""I got so tired that I struggled with so many numbers and symbols and wrote the code, that is, can one day speak to these systems in human language?"" ""

And suddenly everyone said in unison, ""Why not?"" And so it was that Java was born around 1995.

**The reason for the popularity of Java**

Java played a lot with the children of the C family, so it is very similar to the C and C ++ languages, but the object orientation level of Java is higher than C ++ and of course it is more secure.

The Sun was so diverse that it was able to put strange names on different versions of Java. Merlin, Mustang, Tiger, Dolphin are some of the weirdest names in the Java version that have been released in recent years.

Many tools, platforms or libraries also support this language.

It is good to know that many of these platforms are commercial and proprietary, but since Java has everyone's air, it has included several open source libraries among its platforms to satisfy everyone.

Due to the high security of Java, many large and state-owned companies turn to this language to write their programs.

The main and specialized field of Java is building applications in the field of Android, Android was developed under Java from the very beginning, so without consulting Java, it will not work.

**C # Birth**

A few years after the birth of Java, Microsoft, because it liked the capabilities of Java and had a tough competition with the company, after a lot of fuss, finally built a language and named it Cool or Cool.

 But since they could not create a proper logo and treatment with Cole's name, they finally named their cool kid C #.

C sharp is object-oriented like Java, and its level is higher than the c and c ++ languages. But the main thing about Cisharp is that he is very dependent on the operating system and he was anxiously separated from his childhood and did not want to act independently at all. In short, he cried and cried so much that Microsoft built a desktop for him in their own home, Windows, and renamed it the .net environment. So that C # programmers can use them to better develop applications.

This dependency is one of the main differences between Java and C # languages. Java can easily run independently of the system, but C # is dependent on the .net environment and does not work without it, but later it turned out how good .net For example, it can detect and delete extra and unnecessary code.

Since C # is very jealous, it does not tell itself that Java can run on all systems, then I will stay here only on Windows, so he went to his friend .net, he did not leave any friends and by creating a middle language, Made it possible for programs written by C # to run on other operating systems. For example, if you are writing an application for the Android system, you can run the application on another operating system with the tools available in .net and with a slight modification, provided that the .net framework is also installed on the second system.

C # has a lot of system clutter, so if it senses a code might damage the system, it immediately appears like lightning from the unseen and does not allow the code to be written or executed at a later stage.

C # is a compiler language and has good execution speed, so many startups turn to it for various activities. The game developers, of course, are friends with C # and push the boundaries of the world of fantasy and reality with the help of unity3d tool.

As easy as Java is in the Android environment, C # is free in the Windows environment and does not say no to any program, so if you love Microsoft products or like the Windows environment, it's best to get to .net as soon as possible. And go C #.

C # is very popular in Iran and around the world and is supported by many libraries and frameworks, and Microsoft provides a way to develop and improve the performance of C # every day with one or two new tools such as Xamarin.

**Differences between C # and Java**

* **Labor market**

C # entered the market a little later than Java, but soon found a good foothold among Iranian programmers. Because of the ease of working with C #, as well as the presence of powerful toolboxes and frameworks such as .net, almost all Iranian software developers prefer to migrate to C #.

Working with C # is also a bit faster than Java, and since the startup community is always looking to cut costs, it's only natural that C # befriends most startups.

 

Web development and web-based software is also one of the main specialties of this language.

For game development, many companies prefer to go to C #, because with UNITY 3D, it is easier to make the game, and of course, you can save a lot of time and money.

So if you enjoy working with startups or gaming in the country, you can safely go to [C # programming training](https://darsman.com/courses/elementary-education-up-to-moderate-csharp/).

Until recently, Java was the undisputed ruler of app development, until Microsoft introduced Xamarin, and now Java has to step back a bit, because C # also has a lot to say about app development, though it still does. If you like to work in Android environment, it is much better to go to Java and click on C # next to it.

Java is also open to parliament, many large government agencies have to use this language to write their programs due to the high security of Java, on the other hand, Java seems to be more useful for large-scale computing.

The situation abroad, of course, is very different, and many companies still turn to Java first to build applications and software, on the other hand, since Java became friends with Oracle, it has been gaining ground abroad. And of course, it is widely used in the field of making banking and accounting software.

In the end, it seems that the Java market may not be a coin within the country, but its situation across the border is good and it can be counted on to generate revenue.

* **Learn**

Did we say C # is limited to the .NET environment? Well, this is a huge advantage when learning, because you can easily and with much less time, get rid of all the .NET tools, and find your way to this framework much sooner, on the other hand, because of the welcome Many C # in-house programmers do not spend a single day training video to work better with this language.

But the social nature of Java is to its detriment here. Java is just like a robot with twenty hands, these extra hands are the same Java helper frameworks, it is very natural that learning and working with twenty hands is much harder than dealing with a small hand.

Another issue is the level of object-orientation in Java and C #, learning object-orientation in Java is more difficult than in C #, and the choice is yours.

**Conclusion**

C # is a system-dependent language, and with the introduction of new .NET versions, this problem has almost been fixed, but the .NET environment is still not very OPEN SOURCE according to Microsoft policies.

In contrast, Java is an object-oriented language that does not depend on a particular system and can easily travel between the worlds of systems with the help of a Java machine.

Learning C # is much easier because it is simpler and limited to a specific framework, and with a little effort you can easily tame C # Sharp.

On the other hand, with Java in Iran, you can only climb the ladder of large state-owned companies. Of course, Java may be able to get its hands on as a freelance programmer, but due to the great interest of startups in C # and the language skills in developing software under Windows And the desktop, C #, seems to have already taken over the business and revenue market.

Of course, if you are planning to migrate, it is good to know that Java is a flagship in foreign countries due to its security and efficiency, as well as its proper infrastructure, and even large companies like Google prefer to work more with Java-based programmers.

With all of this, no one can choose between C # or Java as a better language for teaching programming, each of these languages ​​has its own characteristics and capabilities, and therefore can be more useful in some activities, ultimately this You have to choose one of these two languages ​​based on your favorite field of work and accompany it until the end of the work and go to C # or [Java language training](https://darsman.com/courses/introductory-and-intermediate-java-language-training/).

4810,2020-10-29 09:54:05,27,1,"Not trying to be controversial or provoke anyone, but I find it weird C# is so unfriendly to people learning to code in most cases.

When I learned Java back  in my computer science education, we had books with concrete excercises at the end of every chapter, when you nailed those you could be sure you had a 100% understanding of the topics. We also had sites like codingbat, where you can sit around and do tons of excercises in a browser window, making it very easy to practice the java wherever you went.

After googling alot and following this sub alot and even posting questions about learning materials in here, it's always the same answer ""C# in a nutshell"" or ""go read the docs"" and no sources for excercises at all? I can't find a single C# books that actually contains concrete excercises and neither can I find any websites that is anything like codingbat.

I'm not a beginner myself, closer to intermediate, but when I'm unemployed for a few months (like currently) it would be nice to be able to look up some excercises somewhere and just practice various things in the browser fx or in a book, to keep the language fresh, without needing visual studio and making an entire project every time.

Also, we are a start up, its a small mobile team, so if you wanted to branch out to our RoR backend api integrations or even to the swift and iOS side of things, we are happy for someone to go down those paths!

&gt; After conducting some real world experiments using the feature described in this JEP it became apparent \[1\] that generic enums don't play well with generic methods. The issues are especially evident when considering static generic methods accepting a Class&lt;X&gt; parameter, where X models an enum type, many of which are defined in the Java SE API itself, like EnumSet::allOf, EnumSet::noneOf. In such cases, passing a class literal corresponding to a generic enum as a paramater would result in a compile-time error --- because of a failure in generic type well-formedness. A proposal attempting to rectify these issues was later formulated and discussed \[2\], but was also found lacking, as it essentially amounted at promoting the use of more raw types, and, more broadly, raised concerns regarding the return on complexity associated with the enhanced-enums feature. For these reasons, we are now withdrawing this JEP.

Optional was presented in Java 8 to explicitly denote the presence of nullability, but we don't have any reliable way to denote the absence of nullability, and they do not work well together (the Optional object itself can be null). Still, we can rely on documentation but I think it would be nicer to have the ability to offer more restrictive enforcement on such a critical and fundamental problem.",Nonnull compiler enforcement?

Hi, 
I'm working on a project with about 30K lines of code. The product is in active development of new release, it contains several modules written several years ago. Recently we started an initiative to improve code quality, specifically to reduce Null Pointer exceptions at run time. Ideally null check should be done on variables before they are used, but much code written in the past does not follow this. I want to use static code scan tools, identify such cases where null check is not performed and then report it back to dev team. Over the period this should be able to achieve goal of reducing NPEs. What tools can help in this regard? A quick search of internet showed PMD, SpotBugs and Sonarqube. I did install Sonarqube but did not find any java checks to this purpose. There is some ErrorProne plugin which can help with this kind of checks (GitHub - uber/NullAway: A tool to help eliminate NPE).

So, I am new to java, and I'm mostly just fiddling around with a small program I created that will take your mpg and distance you want to travel and tell you how many gallons of fuel you need. Just a really simple program. At first I was doing it like this:

float mpg;

float distance;

float totalGal;

totalGal= (distance/mpg)

However, now I'm trying to experiment and assign values to actual places like atlanta or new york city. I was wondering how I could write it so that it fills in the ""distance value with whatever destination I choose. For instance, I have Atlanta as a float value and assigned atlanta as x many miles, so when it asks me what my destination is and i choose atlanta, it has a value, but how do I get it to fill that value into the totalGal?

Background: I've a fair bit of experience building Rails (MVC but mostly Web API) with React.js projects. Over the last couple of months, I've been busy absorbing C\# syntax/ features, writing new backend for existing projects using asp.net core and learning best practices. I want to continue along this path: i.e building APIs using ASP.Net with React/ Redux Frontend. That being said, I am not sure if that's the best skillset mix, esp from an employer's point of view. 

  


I'm noticing a massive hype on social media around Blazer. Seems like all tube content and course creaters are down with this and going batshit crazy. I have no credible source to ask how industry is actually reacting to this. Could someone please advise, if I need bother learning Blazor? (Also, is MVC/razor still in use?) Tbh, server rendered frontend components sounds to me like obsolete tech (for some weird reason it distinctly reminds me of Netscape, backstreet boys, Y2K and dreadful java applets).  


  


Ok, I'm being dramatic and I do get it, at least some of it. Being able to write the entire app in C\# and not having to deal with JS quirkiness; there's definately nothing wrong with that. Besides that, are there any other major upsides that I am not aware of? Is it worth investing proper time in?

Hi, I was asked to implement in Java what a PHP server does. It's a socket server that receives a line, reads it, saves in DB and responds. I did it in Java and all is working with the following problem:

I test the server using a PHP client provided online. When the PHP client calls the PHP server it responds correctly. When it calls my Java socket server the file gets read, saved in DB but the response cannot get through to the client. It says that 0 bytes were received even though I am sending a response.

My question would be, [in this file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XhWMVGPvPoGMieaqQUJ_8zF4rXMsAiMc/view?usp=sharing), i immagine line 1313 on socket\_write(); this servers sends a response to the client. I need to send the same response but I am failing. Is there something specific on this response that the PHP server sends? Could it be that the php client cannot read java? Maybe I should send something encoded in some way?

PS. I would immagine the PHP client will read the response same way the PHP server does on line 793? I don't have access to the client, that's the hard part...

I was trying to make an httplistener in and found that I need to register the uri using netsh, otherwise this wont work. There are many ways to do this, but all require administrator permissions, or an elevated prompt to run the netsh command.

However in java, using NanoHttpd, there is no need for any elevated prompt or running with administrator permissions to be able to listen on this address/port. Does the NanoHttpd library use a diffrent technique to accomplish this, and if so, what can I use to do thesame in c#?","Why do i need to register an uri with netsh (with admin permission) to make an http listener, and why do other languages like java not need this."

It's fully open-source, and is what powers my other project, [EteSync](https://www.etesync.com), and its integrations with GNOME, KDE and the likes. You can self-host it, or use the hosted service.

We already have a working Java library, though it uses JNI and only works on Android at the moment. I'd love feedback/help on what's the best way to add non-Android JNI support. Is it possible to do it from the same repo?

I would also love to get your feedback on the API itself. Did we do anything wrong? Can anything be better? Would love help from from experienced Java developers!

I can build applications from scratch no issue, i'm great at drilling down on clients needs and building functioning and clear code.

I can think of things that would be helpful like pair programming etc, but there isnt much opportunity for that in our company.

**Use-case**

As a first phase Commerce I.T. requested that a user should be able to log a call online. For the initial Helpdesk application (Service Desk) only three roles will be considered: A ***manager***, a ***technician*** and a ***student*** . When a *manager* logs on to the application, they will be able to see the new calls that came in. Only managers will be allowed to see new calls that were logged. Each call status becomes **logged** once it is logged. The status of the call will change to **assigned** after being assigned to a *technician* by the *manager*.

If the *technician* has to provide information or provide a service like answering a question, in which case the customer need not be involved, the call status will become **open**. Should the user require guidance from the technician (helpdesk consultant) in the form of a consultation, the call will also be changed to **open**. The call will stay **open** while a technician is dealing with the request/incident. Once resolved the call status will be changed to **closed** – even if the call was unresolved, but it was decided to discard the issue, the status will become closed .

A *user* can log into the system to see the status of their calls and the technician's response. In special Only the manager can revert the status of a call back to **opened** or **assigned**.

**User Requirements :**

An administrator, technician and student must be able to log into the system in order to access the required functionality. Menu functionality must be updated depending on the role of the user.

A student will be able to log a call and see a list of his/her own calls and the status of the call. Each call must have the name of the student, a short description of the problem as a subject line, as well as a description for the technicians to understand what they must do. Each call will have a priority indicator

– high, low, medium. Each call will also have a status indicator i.e. logged, assigned, open and closed. Each call will also have a comment field that a technician will complete before a call is closed.

A manager will be able to see all the calls that have been logged as well as report on calls logged over a chosen period of time. Managers can assign calls to technicians and change the priority and status of calls. Managers will be able to filter the list according to the different statuses of the calls that were logged. For example, they could see all the active calls or only those that were closed. Optionally managers should be able to search for a specific call (bonus feature).

Each technician will see a list of calls assigned to them and sort the calls according to priority and status. Technicians are able to change the status of a call to **closed**.

   

# System Requirements:

Your application should have the following:

● C# ASP.Net Web Application (.Net Framework)

● Model-View Controller Architecture

● Microsoft Entity Framework

● Code-first approach (we will provide you with some testing date)

● “Individual User Accounts” authentication.

● Collapsible Navigation bar.

● Local DB – SQL Server Express

##### ● User Roles - 3 roles Manager, Technician &amp; Student

● Each User/Role is only allowed access to their specific functionality/data.

● You application should be able to list information in a table format

● Filtering options should be available when information is listed.

● Sorting of information should be available – For example: Managers can sort according to users etc. and results need to be limited to e.g. 10 results per page.

● Search – you might need to include a search function.

● Note: If you can develop a similar application on the platform that you used for your final year project i.e. flutter/React Native etc. given the requirements that we provide you – we will also accept this – your application should also include “individual user accounts” for authentication.C# ASP.Net Web Application (.Net Framework)

# Design Requirements

The following section outlines some design guidelines for your application.

## Database Design

Please assume a minimum length of 5 characters for text fields.

You can use the following “Calls” table as an example for your database design. You can find the Data in the Excel file: **INF3003W\_CaseData30112020.xlsx. Please note that those fields marked with two asterisks(\*\*) in the column headers of the Excel file are required** **fields.**

📷     
 

Fig 2.1 Call table

   

##### Please note that this model excludes your roles table and the user tables created by Microsoft Authentication.

📷     
 

**Fig 2.2 ASP.Net System created tables.**

**User Roles**

In order to assign a user to a role you should use the UserManager as well as the RoleManager. The code snippet provided shows how to create a new instance of the UserManager and RoleManager.

📷     
 

For your Config we suggest that you create three roles namely Manager, Technician and Student.

public void CreateRoles()

{

ApplicationDbContext context = new ApplicationDbContext();

var roleManager = new RoleManager&lt;IdentityRole&gt;(new RoleStore&lt;IdentityRole&gt;(context));

if (!roleManager.RoleExists(""Manager""))

{

var role = new IdentityRole(); role.Name = ""Manager""; roleManager.Create(role);

}

if (!roleManager.RoleExists(""Technician""))

{

var role = new IdentityRole(); role.Name = ""Technician""; roleManager.Create(role);

}

   

if (!roleManager.RoleExists(""Student""))

{

var role = new IdentityRole(); role.Name = ""Student""; roleManager.Create(role);

}

#### When seeding the users you should create at least one administrator (manager), two technicians and three normal users (in this case students). You can use the passwordHasher function to store a secure version of the password. You can also use a GUID for the ID of the user i.e.

var user = new User

{

UserID = Guid.NewGuid()

//Be careful with this line, in this model a guid was used instead of an int for the ID's in the models UserName = ""TechGuy"",

Email = ""[stud1@myuct.ac.za"",](mailto:stud1@myuct.ac.za) FirstName = ""Tech"", LastName = ""Guy"",

StudentNumber = ""TCKGUY001"",

};

#### Remember to add the users that you created to the respective roles i.e. Admin, Technician or user i.e.

userManager.AddToRole(user.Id, roleManager.FindByName(""Technician"").Name);

## UII Design

You can use the following screenshots as an example for your application.

I figured JFrog was an enterprise grade solution, so I started with the open source JFrog Web UI. Long story short, I hit four or five glitches in a row and had a bad time.

The helpful org importer omitted my personal GitHub org. That's okay, I only have a handful of repositories to import, so I still have the option of importing these one by one without much of a fuss. But I would like to inquire about one day adding personal org imports, so I started to reach for a forum to inquire.

Well, JFrog support points of contact are actually hard to reach. The official ""community forum"" is just a link to a tag on StackOverflow, where non-JFrog members are moderating and generally autodeleting these sorts of open-ended questions. I won't bother trying to post there.

I found (two) subreddits with JFrog names, no posts, no sidebar description. Pass.

There are JFrog Confluence pages. There may be Twitter accounts. I could not find an email address. I eventually found a Web form, and I wrote up my entire question long form to gain insight into JFrog's perspective. When I hit submit, I got a 4xx error.

Any one of these oversights would have been easy enough to overlook. But the general lackadaisical attitude to effective, inviting community involvement leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. I think I'll stick with other JAR hosts for now.",JFrog rant (MFW the support system is bugging)

Well...

I have been elected to be part of a competition where we are required to do an individual project. So, I have to develop a mobile application but the problem is, I only have a month as a maximum. I am a computer science student, so I am already familiar with programming languages such as java and python and also familiar with data structure (but not databases)
but I have never developed an app. Or any GUI project. and I really don’t know if it’s even possible to finish it within a month with my beginner level experience. So, I though of asking here for any advice that could save my time so I can plan and manage my time properly. 

Do you think that it is possible?
Is there any learning resources you would recommend?
Is using swift is the best option for my case? 

Note: I know how programming needs time since I’ve already experienced it, and that’s why I am almost panicking right now, but It would be enough to me to get the experience itself out of this competition, I am not putting myself under pressure to win it or something. 

I would be thankful for any advice you could give me. Thank you all.",Developing an app within a month

1. I had to switch from `spring-boot-starter-web` to `spring-boot-starter-webflux` so I can use the `coRouter` in the router DSL. Is this really necessary?
2. I have some IO which I wrapped with `withContext(`[`Dispatchers.IO`](https://Dispatchers.IO)`) {...}` and made the function suspending. Subsequently I converted every function that calls these function suspending as well, all the way to the top (meaning to my rest endpoints). This means that 90% of my functions are now suspending. This seems like a lot of `suspend` keywords. Is this the way to go? Or should I have only made the IO layer suspending and used `launch` or `async` somewhere in between? Or alternatively, is there a way to tell the project that just every function is suspending so that you don't have to repeat this keyword over and over again?
3. I had to wrap my tests in `runBlockingTest {...}` from `kotlinx-coroutines-test` as all my functions are now suspending. This mostly worked great and I didn't have to modify much else. The only thing that bugged me is the following:   
`assertThrows(InvalidValueException::class.java) {`  
`runBlocking { service.doSomething(faultyData) }`  
`}`  
Here I had to introduce the additional `runBlocking` to make it compile. Is there a way around it? Would this be better with different test libraries besides JUnit?
4. I'm writing and reading csv files with `apache-commons-csv` which is blocking. I haven't looked around yet to find a non-blocking csv library. As mentioned above I wrapped all the IO calls in `withContext(`[`Dispatchers.IO`](https://Dispatchers.IO)`) {...}` but IntelliJ is still complaining about `inappropriate blocking method call`s. What should you do about it in case there is no non-blocking library to use?

5002,2020-12-22 20:09:22,2,1,"Hi, i'm looking for some career advice, but first a little context about me and my situation. I'm from Argentina and now I'm living in Madrid Spain, I've been around the code since I was 14 years old, currently I'm 30, I graduated as a programming technician in high school and then studied systems engineering (what in the rest of the world is known as computer science) but I did not finish the degree, I completed 50% of it. From then until now I have been working as a software developer and the last 4 years as a JAVA developer, in different companies, different teams of all sizes, different projects from different fields such as banking and e-commerce.

In all the projects I have been in until now, I was able to meet the expectations and even in some of them exceed them, although in many moments I felt that I was not going to be able to achieve it or that the situation exceeded my knowledge or preparation, I think this is known as the impostor syndrome and sometimes it causes me some stress at work, which has been increasing in the last time.

Many times I feel that in most situations what I do to solve things is google them, try to understand how they work and give some kind of solution that in most cases works but I feel that deep down I only touch the surface of knowledge. I feel that I lack deep knowledge about the basics of programming, such as design patterns, code clarity, exception handling, etc. I am not a fan of seniorities but if I had to define one for myself I would say it is semi-senior.

I think I'm at a point where I need to take a step in my professional career to finish solidifying my profession as a programmer, but I don't know in which direction to do it or what guidelines to follow, so I'm looking if someone could give me some advice or recommendation of how to continue maturing my career to overcome all these points mentioned before.

5009,2020-12-25 16:13:55,46,1,"From time to time, people do measure math operations done in Java and PHP and the difference can be really big.

But from my understanding (which could be wrong), both languages have virtual machines running bytecode/opcode; Java will precompile it, PHP will do it during runtime. And I assume ``opcache.novalidate`` for max performance so once opcode is generated, PHP runs at full speed.

---

The only **major** difference that I can see is that PHP keeps checking parameter types, something that Java doesn't need to do because of integrated static analysis. 

Now with PHP having JIT, the real question I have:

- is there any other technical difference that I missed above?

---

Just for fun; 

let's say PHP gets an option to disable typehint check and we rely on phpstan/psalm. So technically it would be _possible_ to have Java speed, right? 

I.e. if all of the above is correct, there wouldn't be **technical** differences that affects the speed, right?


---

Keep in mind that this is just my curiosity; PHP is already very fast but I never really understood this VM stuff. 

And I am not saying that I would even want core developers to focus on speed; there are other things and more speed is not even on my top 10 wishlist.",Can someone ELI5 the major difference between PHP and JAVA internals?

&amp;nbsp;

So my normal day to day is as an application developer. I'm building my 1st library that will be used outside of my direct team and application.

&amp;nbsp;

So my question is should I just publish the jar using jdk 7 as `mylib.jar`, or is there any benefit to publishing it in multiple versions? i.e. `mylib-java7.jar`, `mylib-java8.jar`, and `mylib-java11.jar`, etc...

As you can see, you are able to change the output by manipulating the url. So when you enter hr=10 you get the sun elevation at 10 am. I want to WebScrape the elevation for every 1 hour in a day, so hr=0 -&gt; hr=24. And then I want to add the values of every hour to a line chart, so that I get a chart of the elevation of the sun during a give day. I have been able to WebScrape the data for one specific value, but the code is pretty long, and I think there is a better way of doing this than using the same code 24 times and just editing the hour. Also I don't know how im supposed to even get the output data into a chart. I would appreciate some help, for example via discord

It’s a nice place and I really enjoy working with my team but, the actual work doesn’t really interest me and outside of this company the language I work in in not really used.

I made a small tool to make local development a little bit lazier for myself and co-conspirators, and to have an excuse to work more with Kotlin. I also wanted something I could easily share without worrying about compiling it for every platform, or what version of Python was installed - so Kotlin felt like the perfect tool for the job. Would love feedback.

[locurlfwd@github](https://github.com/danpozmanter/locurlfwd)

Essentially I wanted to run an API off a remote server (or locally on a different port), and run the frontend locally, without having to think about CORS or setting up nginx.

So if you had a server running off `myapi.mydomain.com/api/`, and were running a local REACT app via npm off `localhost:3000`, you could run:

    java -jar locurlfwd.jar 9000 -d http://localhost:3000 -d api=https://myapi.mydomain.com

Then test on localhost:9000 in the browser.

I used jooby for the server, and the new kotlinx-cli library (rather than clikt).",Local URL Forwarding App

TLDR: I am kinda stuck in the tutorial hell, I dont know where to move next after I finished the basic language syntax. Is there any good course, curriculum or anyting where I can be a job ready C++ programmer? like for java: Jobreadyprogrammer.com

Long story:

I am an Engineering Manager Bsc, pursuing career in the field of digital marketing. I want to become a Back-End Developer, and go to higher abstraction (autonomus systems, self driving cars, etc. in the future). I already did the MOOC of University of Helsinki Java I. I started to learn C++, because I was told that its has many concepts that are hard to grasp on (pointers, operator overloading etc) which can make you in general, a better (java) developer. My question is, that after 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I learned the basic syntax (followed the lectures of [learncpp.com](https://learncpp.com)), and I already know the basics of OOP from my Java knowledge. I bought the C++ Nanodegree from Udacity, but I canceled it after 1 months, because it is too advanced.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I have to 

\- Learn about data structures and algorithms (Found a great study material, and bought Algoexpert, doing Hackerrank)

\- Learn about Databases (SQL maybe?)

\- Learn about Design Patterns

\- Make some pet projects (My github already has cca. 100 Java apps thanks to the project-based MOOC)

Where should I move next? The hard part is that, you can learn web development easier (freecodecamp, the odin project, etc.) there are many materials if you want to become a Java developer. What about C++? I feel that its a little bit forgotten language, no interactive tutorials, no step-by-step projects (like the jetbrains academy for Java, where you can just pick a project from beginner to hard level and you can make a Blockchain project.

Should I continue to learn Java and try to implement the material in C++ as well? Do I have to slow down and do the OSSU computer science course? 

How should I tackle these steps to achieve my goal? I feel a bit overwhelmed without any mentor.",Self-taught C++ advice?

Don't take this as me hating on java, in my short 4 years of programming proffesionally so far I just have never looked at a problem or project and thought AHA! JAVA is the solution i NEED for this.

The only time I used Java was at school, and there I just programmed everything in C# and it was mostly correct. Only problems I had was with MySQL, but that's not the point.

If I wanna programm a Mobile App, I use Flutter. Even if I don't intend on developing for iOS, I have the ability to very easily include it, and even if iOS is out of the question I still love Flutter, and if Flutter is out of the question, I'd use Kotlin or C# with Xamarin because fuck Oracle.

If I want to program something that needs to be optimized like routing algorithms or other backend, no question, C++ or C. Java optimization is ... eh.

If there is a tool I need to do something real quick, creating mockdata for example or doing something else, some other util, pyhton is what i will use. Python is so fun I started contributing to open source in my free time and play around a lot with it, because it just a comfy language to use.

If I want to program a game, I will use Unity and there I will use C#, because C# is beautiful, and also not by oracle.

ANY desktop App I'd want to do, I would use C# for, using XAMARIN (which is pretty) unless it needs too much optimization, then C++, or it is extremely simple, then python. 

If I wanna do Data Science, web crawling or whatever - python.

If I wanna do Websites, which i never did, i guess JavaScript and HTML?

Why is it that most projects and programs I use are either made with C#, C++ or Python? What do you, dearest other redditor, use Java for where you decided 'java is the best solution for this'? Why did you in that instance pick Java?",Is it just me or can't I find a good use for Java?

I have joined the development of an old JavaEE (2016 or older) project. The structure seems like the original devs hadn't had much experienced with JavaEE or the code is just vastly outdated, idk.

They used tomcat7, java8, servlets, hibernate without jpa, google guice for dependency injection and not cdi.

What I wonder about the code is, why they did not even use the typical annotations on classes or methods like @GET, @INJECT or @Transactional, @Entity etc.

In every documentation or tutorial they are part of it nowadays.
Where they introduced in JavaEE at a certain version?

What would happen in a modern jakarta Web Applikation when you dont write the @GET of @inject etc. annotations?
Do they even have an effect on the compilation or are they just there to make the code more understandable? What happens when one is not using them?

Also, they did use hibernate but not jpa. The had a hibernate mapping file and classes for the entities but even these were not annotated.

And the had DTO classes for every entity but these are used nowhere..

I am even not sure they used EJBs. The entity classes look like simple POJOs.

Also they just used tomcat 7 as web container. But wasnt this version not supporting EJBs? TomEE fits better I guess. 

I would really like to migrate to jakarta and hopfully microservices but it seems I need to understand first what actually is going on there and what is redundant.

This plugin makes it easy to incorporate any tool available via the ToolProvider API into a Maven build without the use of shell scripts. In Java 15, this is particularly helpful for working with jdeps, jlink, and jpackage. jmod, jar, javac, javadoc, javap are also available. This plugin is available via Maven Central. The most recent update adds shortcut argument aliases for many of these tools.

Find more information about [jtoolprovider-plugin on GitHub](https://github.com/wiverson/jtoolprovider-plugin).

Second - maven-jpackage-template - a template leveraging the above plugin to seamlessly generate native JavaFX desktop applications. Some of the features in the template include:

* Leverage Maven profiles to automatically generate macOS and Windows installers.
* Continue to use ordinary Maven dependencies, but still leverage modules to generate \~30mb native installers (e.g. DMG and MSI).
* Use GitHub Actions to automatically generate macOS and Windows installers - develop on, say, Linux and let GitHub generate macOS &amp; Windows builds for you.
* Illustrates many native desktop integration features - e.g. file system drag-n-drop, single menubar on macOS &amp; dynamic dock icon updates on macOS, and more.

Find more information about the [JavaFX native desktop template on GitHub](https://github.com/wiverson/maven-jpackage-template).

Both of the above are available under the Apache 2.0 license.

If you have any questions about any of the above, let me know!

P.S. Blatant plug: If you are interested in deploying Java desktop apps, please check out [ChangeNode](https://changenode.com/) \- auto-update, crash reporting, analytics and more.

The python program does a lot of reading binary and writing binary.

I've been using the java.io.File class to read files as a byte array, so far it's working just fine, but I ran into a problem.

I have some 32 bit, signed, little endian, int that I want to read in this byte array. I had no idea where to start so I went to google.

I found some code:

    fun getIntAt(inx: Int): Int {
    //fileBytes is the byte array
    val bytes = fileBytes.copyOfRange(inx,inx + 4)

    var result: Int = 0
 for (i in bytes.indices) {
        result = result or (bytes[i].toInt() shl  8 * i)
    }
 return result
}

I'm not really sure what shl does...

for the most part this works, however some of the int that get returned are negative, with is not suppose to happen. I thought it had to do something with my indexing but throwing it into a hex editor I got the value I was looking for

the byte array \[-88,2,0,0\]  
should be returning 680,   
but it's returning -88

Sorry for the programming question, there was very little online about this.

The relational operators `==` and `!=` work with all objects, but their results
can be confusing:

    // operators/Equivalence.java

    public class Equivalence {
      static void show(String desc, Integer n1, Integer n2) {
        System.out.println(desc + "":"");
        System.out.printf(
          ""%d==%d %b %b%n"", n1, n2, n1 == n2, n1.equals(n2));
      }
      @SuppressWarnings(""deprecation"")
      public static void test(int value) {
        Integer i1 = value;                             // [1]
        Integer i2 = value;
        show(""Automatic"", i1, i2);
        // Old way, deprecated in Java 9 and on:
        Integer r1 = new Integer(value);                // [2]
        Integer r2 = new Integer(value);
        show(""new Integer()"", r1, r2);
        // Preferred in Java 9 and on:
        Integer v1 = Integer.valueOf(value);            // [3]
        Integer v2 = Integer.valueOf(value);
        show(""Integer.valueOf()"", v1, v2);
        // Primitives can't use equals():
        int x = value;                                  // [4]
        int y = value;
        // x.equals(y); // Doesn't compile
        System.out.println(""Primitive int:"");
        System.out.printf(""%d==%d %b%n"", x, y, x == y);
      }
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        test(127);
        test(128);
      }
    }
    /* Output:

    Primitive int:

    */


The `show()` method compares the behavior of `==` to the method `equals()` that
exists for all objects. The `printf()` format argument uses the specifier `%d`
for `int` output, `%b` for Boolean output, and `%n` to produce a newline.

If you need a ""not equal"" comparison, use `n1 != n2` and  `!n1.equals(n2)`.

In `test()`, you see integer-valued objects created in four different ways:

- **[1]**: Automatic conversion to `Integer`.
- **[2]**: Using standard `new` object-creation syntax. This *was* the preferred
  way to create ""wrapped"" `Integer` objects.
- **[3]**: Starting with Java 9, `valueOf()` is preferred over **[2]**. If you
  try to use form **[2]** with Java 9, you'll get a warning and a suggestion to
  use **[3]** instead. It is difficult to determine whether **[3]** is preferred
  over **[1]**, and **[1]** seems much cleaner.
- **[4]**: As primitive `int`s.

The `@SuppressWarnings(""deprecation"")` is not necessary for Java 8, but is
included in case you compile the code with Java 9 or newer.

For a `value` of 127, the comparisons produce the results you expect, *except*
form **[2]** which produces `false` for `==` and `true` for `equals()`. Although
the *contents* of the objects are the same, the references point to different
objects in memory. The operators `==` and `!=` compare object references, and
have different behavior *depending on how the `Integer` objects are
created*---presumably, **[1]** and **[3]** yield `Integer`s that point to the
same storage in memory. `Integer` values from -128 through 127 produce this
behavior for `==` and `!=`, but outside that range they will not, as seen with
the call `test(128)`.

If you're using `Integer` you must only use `equals()`. If you accidentally use
`==` and `!=` for `Integer` and don't test it for values outside -128 through
127, your code will pass but will be quietly broken. If you're using primitive
`int`s then you *can't* use `equals()` and *must* use `==` and `!=`. This can
cause problems if you start by using `int`s and then later change to `Integer`s,
or vice-versa.

In Java 9 and on, the use of `new Integer()` is deprecated to eliminate this
issue. Think about that. Java has included this very odd behavior for *two
decades* before acknowledging it was a mistake.

When working with floating-point numbers, you encounter different equivalence
problems, not because of Java but because of the nature of floating-point
numbers:

    // operators/DoubleEquivalence.java

    public class DoubleEquivalence {
      static void show(String desc, Double n1, Double n2) {
        System.out.println(desc + "":"");
        System.out.printf(
          ""%e==%e %b %b%n"", n1, n2, n1 == n2, n1.equals(n2));
      }
      @SuppressWarnings(""deprecation"")
      public static void test(double x1, double x2) {
        // x1.equals(x2) // Won't compile
        System.out.printf(""%e==%e %b%n"", x1, x2, x1 == x2);
        Double d1 = x1;
        Double d2 = x2;
        show(""Automatic"", d1, d2);
        Double r1 = new Double(x1);
        Double r2 = new Double(x2);
        show(""new Double()"", r1, r2);
        Double v1 = Double.valueOf(x1);
        Double v2 = Double.valueOf(x2);
        show(""Double.valueOf()"", v1, v2);
      }
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        test(0, Double.MIN_VALUE);
        test(Double.MAX_VALUE,
          Double.MAX_VALUE - Double.MIN_VALUE * 1_000_000);
      }
    }
    /* Output:
    0.000000e+00==4.900000e-324 false
    Automatic:
    0.000000e+00==4.900000e-324 false false
    new Double():
    0.000000e+00==4.900000e-324 false false
    Double.valueOf():

    Double.valueOf():
    1.797693e+308==1.797693e+308 false true
    */

On paper, the comparison of floating point numbers should be very strict---a
number that is the tiniest fraction different from another number should still
be unequal. This works for the call to `test(0, Double.MIN_VALUE)`, where
`Double.MIN_VALUE` is the smallest representable value. (`%e` in the `printf()`
call presents the results in exponential notation).

However, it does not hold true for the second `test()` call, where the argument
`x2` is the value of `x1` minus one million times `Double.MIN_VALUE`. It seems
like `x2` should be significantly different than `x1`, but the two numbers still
compare as equal. You encounter this kind of problem in virtually every
programming language because when a variable holds a very large number,
subtracting a relatively small number won't make a significant difference. This
is called a *rounding error* and occurs because the machine cannot hold enough
information to represent a tiny change to a large number.

You might be fooled into thinking that using `==` produces a correct result in
this case, but it does not---it is simply comparing references.

Using `equals()` when you're not working with primitives seems like the
straightforward answer, but it's not as simple as that. Consider class `ValA`:


    // operators/EqualsMethod.java
    // Default equals() does not compare contents

    class ValA {
      int i;
    }

    class ValB {
      int i;
      // Works for this example, not a complete equals():
      public boolean equals(Object o) {
        ValB rval = (ValB)o;  // Cast o to be a ValB
        return i == rval.i;
      }
    }

    public class EqualsMethod {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        ValA va1 = new ValA();
        ValA va2 = new ValA();
        va1.i = va2.i = 100;
        System.out.println(va1.equals(va2));
        ValB vb1 = new ValB();
        ValB vb2 = new ValB();
        vb1.i = vb2.i = 100;
        System.out.println(vb1.equals(vb2));
      }
    }
    /* Output:
    false
    true
    */


In `main()`, `va1` and `va2` contain identical values for `i`, but the result of
comparing them using `equals()` is `false`, which is confusing again. This
happens because the default behavior of `equals()` is to compare references. To
produce the desired behavior of comparing the contents, you must *override*
`equals()` as in class `ValB`. `ValB.equals()` contains only the minimum
necessary code to solve the problem for this example, but it is not a proper
`equals()`. Note that the standard argument for `equals()` is an `Object` (not a
`ValB`), so we must force `o` to be a `ValB` using a *cast*: `(ValB)o`
(ordinarily you must check the type first before casting, but we'll skip that
until a later chapter). Then we can compare the two values of `i`, using `==`
because they are primitives.

Most of the standard library classes override `equals()` to compare the contents
of objects instead of their references.

I'm a Kotlin newcomer, I've been learning for a while now and I'm mainly interested in building Desktop apps and GUIs. As the title says, I've been using TornadoFx for a while and I found that was perfect for my porpouses.

The problems started while I was trying to build a jar from it (using gradle): either I got noClassFound exception, or no manifest attribute found error or JavaFx components needed but not found. The project runs smoothly (gradle task run) but It does not correctly build an executable jar. So I started wondering if there was any problem with my gradle build.

I started looking on the web but for a newbie It's a bit of a jungle of informations out there: everyone tells just a piece of the full story and It becomes really hard to understand what is the correct behaviour for your situation. Plus, from what I understood, TornadoFx has many forks and side projects (LauncherFx, Badass runtime plugin,..) to work with Java9, Java 10 and others.

I am currently using openJdk11, javafx 11.0.2 and kotlin 1.4 (as the guide of tornadofx suggests for openjdk users). Is this the correct setup? Do you guys have any updated docs to follow and to learn from to build something executable?

Should I just give up and start learning JPCompose for desktop? D:

&amp;nbsp;

So my professional life started in 2018, the same year Java 11 came out. I work for a large bank, so I don't expect the cutting edge, but for the life of me I can't understand why it seems like everyone (not counting this sub) still thinks Java 8 is the new thing. I see coworkers starting brand new projects with java 8. I see job listings and hiring managers that specifically mention java 8. Oracle/Amazon/Zulu are offering java 8 updates at least until 2030, far longer than java 11. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm always a little sad when I see people pushing Kotlin/Go/etc and they cite some some feature that java is missing, when in reality newer versions of java have said feature. Or when they mention performance as a reason to move to Go, but if they just updated their runtime to a newer java version, they would likley see large gains for free.

&amp;nbsp;

So I'd love to hear your thoughts. Why is java 8 so popular compared to say 11 or 15? Will 17 take off faster than 11 did?

I was afraid that someone might be using it directly and that prevented me to apply some changes as it might brake their code. The obvious solution would be making this internal class package protected but that might not always possible. Java 11 provides modules which gives the developer the possibility to not expose certain classes, but that will only work if the end user is also having a project with module-info.java file.

The ideal solution would be sealed classes but that is available from java 15 onwards. I came up with a lightweight library to easily protect publicly accessible internal implementations for java 8+.

Altough Rosetta works fine, it's slow. So I used Azul JDK 15 build for M1.

As a first test I wrote a few QR Code examples ([Github](https://github.com/lessthanoptimal/KBoofExamples/tree/master/src/main/kotlin), [Medium w/video](https://medium.com/@peter.abeles/qr-code-scanner-in-kotlin-e15dd9bfbb1f?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ef089675e392f8bb43dde10f583f8770)) (e.g. create, scan, estimate 3D pose) in Kotlin where many of these new features are used. 

As an example of what I've done with extensions, [BufferedImage](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/image/BufferedImage.html) has been extended with functions for converting it into more useful data types. This is much easier than the Java equivalent. A lot of math operations now also have a cleaner API.

What I'm hoping to get is feedback on the extensions, also how Kotlinized the example code is, and other suggestions for improving Kotlin integration (besides rewriting everything in Kotlin). I know the extensions are poorly documented at the moment and that's because they are a sketch.

5228,2021-02-25 19:22:20,16,1,"I'm implementing a [simple java virtual machine](https://github.com/phillbush/jvm) for school. For now it just reads a class file into a `ClassFile` structure, I'll write the disassembler and the jvm itself later.

In `class.c`, I'm using setjmp(3) to move control back to the function that reads the class file (`class_read()`) when an error occurs in one of the functions called by it.
When an error occurs, `class_read()` will free the `ClassFile` structure it was building.

However, the functions called by `class_read()` also allocate memory. And, if I do nothing, those memory spaces will be lost after the `longjmp`. To overcome this, I wrapped `malloc(3)` in a function that push the allocated pointer onto a global stack.  This pointer is popped when the function can successfully return the pointer; but, when an error occurs, longjmp moves control back to class_read(), whichwill free every pointer on this stack.

Is this a hack? Is this a good programming practice? Can I make it better?

Is blocking NIO faster than blocking IO even in single-connection networking?


Simply googling it does give us several hits that proves NIO is faster &amp; more efficient than IO in “massive-client network management”.

But, will it be faster than the IO when we don’t need to handle massive client? Like only one client is connected?

Being specific, let’s say we are going to send data(e.g. big files) from one computer to another(so, only one client!).
In this situation, which will be faster, Blocking IO or Blocking NIO?(non-Blocking or asynchronous connection won’t be useful in this situation, right?)

Some people say that modern Java’s IO is implemented to use NIO inside so nothing but scalability is their difference([see](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9247832)), but others consist that NIO is still faster because the other make some overhead with converting raw data to byte array([see](https://coderanch.com/t/276098/java/Java-NIO-traditional-IO)).

Which is correct, and what should we use when we want to have fastest network with client(s) that we can easily handle without massive multithreading?",Is Channel(nio) faster than Stream(io) even in single-connection networking?

We used some \*coding magic\* to hook into the game at runtime in order to be able to do anything we want, though so far we've only managed to enable hidden features as we need more devs for cooler stuff! (feel free to join the discord server below if you'd like to contribute to the project). The pictures at the bottom of this post were taken on two of our most popular multiplayer MCPI servers and showcase features such as:

\- Survival mode

\- Natural mob generation

\- Enhanced UI (which has more features such as being able to make a survival world without hexedit)

\- Fancy graphics

\- Smooth lighting (or as smooth as a version of Minecraft from 2013 can get)

\- Increased render distance

And much much more!  Not only that, we made our own full server software for hosting your multiplayer games!  We are also working on in-game sounds and a full-on ""world edit"" for MCPI, with things such as space selection with wands, commands, and shape generation. We used Python and tkinter and also make a custom launcher called ""[MCPIL](https://github.com/MCPI-Revival/MCPIL)"" with config options for the mod, as well as a ton of our other projects like [MCPIEdit](https://github.com/MCPI-Revival/mcpiedit) which is basically a MCPI NBT editor, and [MCBES](https://github.com/mcpi-revival/mcbes) (WIP) which translates MCPI multiplayer packets to bedrock. And we’ve saved the best for last! All of our projects are licensed open source, so you can modify, contribute, and redistribute them to your heart’s content! And did we forget to mention that we've made the mod a docker container so you can run MCPI on any Linux OS and system, even x86 PCs?

My background is with java from a start but I've later moved on to c# and c++.

I think my biggest problem with python is the dynamic typing. It just won't make sense in my head. You can't combine 2 variables when printing because the compiler doesn't care to automatically convert them to string where they should be converted.Also recursion is a pain in the butt because return types are optional so reading the code makes for lots of simple mistakes that wouldn't be missed in a stricter language. Also lists can both contain variables and lists and tuples and lists of lists etc. It makes it really annoying to write any compile secure function as I would have to acknowledge every possible combination.Also IDEs aren't as friendly as they are for statically typed languages.It literally makes me nauseous to work with python, and it sucks because I really want to like the language. It's just too chaotic for me.

Does anyone have any advice of how I should interpret the language to give me less headache and nausea? It really does feel like looking at an ugly painting to read code in python.I even took a introductory course in python at university and I still can't get over this feeling.

At the moment, I am looking to buy a new CPU to replace my trusty (but old) intel i5 4570 from 2014.
I currently work at university [they did provide me with a beefy work station], but sometimes I want to let my computational studies run at home.

Generally, I am doing algorithm development: In order to test these algorithms, we let them solve a large number of generic problem instances. This can be nicely done in parallel by using the Java Thread class. [Creating some sort queue for all the many hundred problem instances that are to be solved and then have one thread solve one problem instance at a time. Data does not need to be exchanged between the different threads.]

My question is now: Is it correct that I should opt for a CPU with a relatively large core/thread count?
Would the speed scale linearily with the number of cores of the CPU [let's assume equal clock speed]?

Currently I am looking at the AMD Ryzen 3900x with 12cores/24threads. Many people say that the Ryzen 5600x is equally as good. However I believe that most of this is just gamer-talk or based on generic benchmarks. Is it correct that for my use case, the 3900x (12 cores vs. 6 cores of the 5600x) is recommendable?

Does Threading work equally well on AMD and Intel or is there anything else I need to keep in mind?

I've been a high school Computer Science teacher for over 10 years (like 11ish but who's counting at this point...)

I have always taught kids in my room but I started teaching an AP Computer Science course in java virtually two years ago. This was all fine and good but I got interested in providing my own a-synchronous resources for my students to make learning virtually more accessible. Fast forward a year and we've convinced my district that if I can make video series for students to learn introduction programming then it will help non-trained teachers offer these courses to students at smaller rural schools where there are less course offerings.

That triggered me getting to produce my Arduino course. Then this year, expedited by the pandemic and the need for virtual resources, I got to build my Python course. Next up is building a full Java course that hits on everything in the AP Computer Science A curriculum.

I know there's a million resources out there and I was doing it for my district and my students, but I figured if I'm going to be doing it anyway, I might as well share it with a broader audience. So, with permission, I ""branded"" the content and published it all on YouTube.

Anyway, from one CS teacher to a bunch of humans trying to learn how to code: I hope it's helpful.

5298,2021-03-28 21:51:19,75,1,"Before starting the discussion, I would like to narrow down the discussion to construction of new applications to serve HTTP + SSR (server-side rendering).

In the last years, I feel we have had a ""boom"" in the java framework space, now we have many more options than we had before. My understanding is that still Spring/Boot \[1\] is THE major player in the Java framework space, but in the age of Kubernetes and containers its startup time is really annoying (yes, they are working on the native build, but it's still in beta \[2\]). Its dev-feedback loop is also suboptimal when you compare to (said to be) more modern ""ecosystems"" (not object of the discussion here, so I won't mention).

To list couple of options that appeared in the last years:

* OpenLiberty ([https://openliberty.io/](https://openliberty.io/))
* Microprofile ([https://microprofile.io/](https://microprofile.io/))
* Micronaut ([https://micronaut.io/](https://micronaut.io/))
* Quarkus ([https://quarkus.io/](https://quarkus.io/))

The not so old, but not so common either:

* Vertx ([https://vertx.io/](https://vertx.io/))
* Javalin ([https://javalin.io/](https://javalin.io/))

For server-side rendering, I've found a **really** nice option, which is still very young, but IMHO much better than thymeleaf, jsp, jsf, freemarket, velocity, etc.

* jte ([https://github.com/casid/jte/](https://github.com/casid/jte/))

So let's say at least for SSR I already know what I'll be using.

Now, besides the dev-feedback loop aspect and the startup time of such frameworks, we could also take a look at the performance. 

If we look at the TechEmpower benchmarks \[3\], we see that the Java framework performing the best is called Jooby \[4\]. Though it performs the best amongst the Java frameworks, I'd argue that's a ""fairly exotic"" one (no offense), i.e. not so widely spread and therefore hard to find examples, users to exchange ideas, integration with other tools/systems, etc etc.

Maybe the question here could be: how much the performance shown in TechEmpower matters anyway? Netflix, for example, is a major user of Spring and they are very happy with it \[5\]. Would the average application hit such performance limit where you'd even consider changing framework/language to get better performance and resource usage?

Hence my question: **What would you use to start a new HTTP + SSR project with Java today?**

Next  I double click on a .iss(inno setup compiler) executable, which then  renders a text file/gui window, then set the date variable(example:  const Date = '20210413';), then, in the inno gui I click the  compile(control+f9) button, and finally when the compilation says  finished, I click on the close button(the red x).

I mean I picked up c# 2 weeks ago for my second course after programming in java for a month or 2 in another before. I've had no experience programming before that. With that being said, while I'm grateful to be in college, my professor with all due respect is kind of subpar. I've had the same professor for these 2 courses and while he's a very nice guy he does not explain stuff well at all and there's so much technical difficulties in his class it's like I'm fighting to learn and submit what I want to. 

So besides tutorials, language references and some small reading, I've recently started picking up side projects, just things to keep me going and learning and interacting with coding rather than just the boring weekly assignment so I can not get bored and so I can see what it's like to work with it when it's something I want to do. This has felt great, I've been learning a lot, like constructors, the basics of object oriented programming, refactoring, the works. The great thing now is I actually know the reasoning behind why some of the code works and what I'm doing (I can see I'm passing a string parameter to the WriteLine method rather than seeing it as a ""make words"" line). 

Today I completed the first program that I'm really proud of. A client sided, file based password manager that generates, and finds already existing passwords that's based around a text file on the user's computer. It even asks for confirmation before writing to the file and allows the user to tweak the password if it doesn't fit the website exactly. A little shoddy, I know, but it's made me extremely happy. For the first time I've made an actual very useful program that I have and will use, and it's sitting on my task bar.

In my app, there are two navigation icons, one fr the ""my account section"" and the search icon to show the users' list that have created the account via Firebase Auth the search one has a fragment that consists of a recycler view. this recycler view is supposed to show the users list.

the recycler view is NOT showing the updated users' but the previously set list when I go to the search icon for the first time, but the moment I go to ""my account section"" and then come back to the search icon, it starts showing what it is supposed to show i.e. the updated users' list. Please help me with this bug.

This is the recycler view fragment's onCreate() function:

the function getChoiceCurrentUser() basically is for filtering the users according to what interest they choose.

    override fun onCreateView(         inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?,         savedInstanceState: Bundle?     ): View? {         println(""onCreateView()"")         userListenerReg = FirestoreUtil.addUserLis(             this.requireActivity(),             FirestoreUtil.getChoiceCurrentUser(),             this::updateRecView         )         return inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_search, container, false)     }

This is where the recycler view is supposed to be shown in the updated form

The update recycler view function: 

&amp;#x200B;

    fun updateRecView(itemsVar: List&lt;Item&gt;) { // contains two nested functions fun initialiseRecView() {             recycler_view_search_people.apply {                 layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(this@SearchFragment.context)                 adapter = GroupAdapter&lt;ViewHolder&gt;().apply {                     peopleSec = Section(itemsVar)                     add(peopleSec)                     setOnItemClickListener(onItemClickVar)                 }             }             inRecViewCheck = false         }          fun updateTheItems() = peopleSec.update(itemsVar)          if (inRecViewCheck) {             initialiseRecView()         } else {             updateTheItems()         }      }

 and here is the FirestoreUtil's member function:  

    fun addUserLis(         context: Context,         choice: Any?,         onListen: (List&lt;Item&gt;) -&gt; Unit     ): ListenerRegistration {         return firestoreInstance.collection(""users"")             .addSnapshotListener { querySnapshotVar, fbFsException -&gt;                 if (fbFsException != null) {                     println(fbFsException)                     return@addSnapshotListener                 }                  val i = mutableListOf&lt;Item&gt;()                 querySnapshotVar?.documents?.forEach {                     if (it[""choice""] == choice &amp;&amp;                         it.id != FirebaseAuth.getInstance().currentUser?.uid                     )                         i.add(                             Person(                                 it.toObject(User::class.java),                                 userID = it.id,                                 context = context                             )                         )                 }                 onListen(i)              }     }

Now, some webservice [propose a swagger](https://swagger.io/)  (AKA openapi) that displays the resources available, as well as the security requirement to access those resources. Example github proposes [https://github.com/github/rest-api-description](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description)

There is already [a project](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) to produce programmatical access to such a webservice in java.

How comes there is not a library to produce a code that would make be integrated easily in spring-boot ?  Typically a dedicated maven project would compile from the swagger description my.swagger.yaml into its src/generated/java , eg the classes org.github.openapi.GithubSSOV2, this project would be in dependency of the springboot and could request the github with `@autowired GithubSSOV2 github` then use it like the previous Facebook from spring-social-facebook.

I was interested in checking out the modern c# stack for a change of pace and a learning adventure.  
But, I haven't worked with c# - or the ilk since some nasty mono memories in unity -- years ago. What are the actual modern frameworks for exposing web services / api. I was curious so I could find tutorials that weren't riddled in older tech, and it's cumbersome to navigate c# with .NEt, [Asp.Net](https://Asp.Net), having Core added after either.

5379,2021-04-21 15:40:46,63,1,"TL:DR;    I helped a Jr. developer with their project working on the two main features for the project.  They received a major company award for the program without recognizing others efforts to make their program worth getting an award for.

When this happened, I had 10 years under my development belt.  I was just understanding the ""art"" and ""science"" behind development instead of just hacking at it until it worked.  Software architecture and construction where just sinking in, and .net (2.0 at the time) was mature enough for the company I worked at to be adopted.  I had switched from VB 6.0 to [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) (I have since repented of this sin and moved to c#).  I was leading a group of three developers, myself, a mainframe developer desperately trying to validate their need to the company, and a very, very jr. developer.

This jr. developer, whom I will refer to as X from here on out, was just out of school.  Previous to their foray into development, this person was line manager for another manufacturing company.  So their experience in programming was what they learned at the local university, which did not teach .NET at all.  

So, I hired X knowing they were new, but confident they could pick up the language and learn programming in .net since they had java experience and a good foundation of OOP.  So we worked on our first project together.  X did a lot of the front end work making the forms pretty, and I worked on the middle and back end interfacing with the SQL server database (this was before EF so it was a lot of tedious work).  We released the program into the wild, and it was a smash hit.  We saved the company at least $750k a year and kept a major customer from walking.  We got recognized from corporate, and won the regional award.  X got to cut their teeth on a major project, and was confident enough to start working on their own with guidance from me.

Fast forward two years.  X is now working on another project that is going to revolutionize the incident reporting system the company is using.  X is promising big things, and really selling this software.  X promised two features they were having problems getting to work.  The big feature was a spell check for the input.  This was promised to make the report professional when submitted to the government or auditors.  Apparently the company was embarrassed many times with typos that, well...let's just say the language was not appropriate.  The second, was a set of KPI reports that would give an overall picture we could hand to auditors to speed along safety audits. 

Well as you can guess, X had no clue on how to implement a spellcheck and didn't have enough experience with SQL to generate SQL statements for the reports that didn't take forever to run.  So, after two weeks of struggling and the deadline fast approaching, they asked me for help.  I stopped my work, implemented a spellcheck and re-wrote all their SQL reports.  The software was released on time to much fanfare.  The internal customer and X started their campaign to nominate this software for another award.  X came to me to help write up the technical aspects of the spellcheck and reports, my manager flitted around hitting up all the right people and making the right calls to get this on the radar.  

Well nominations came out and X's program received another award.  And much to my surprise my name was left of the contributors list.  No big deal I guess, the awards don't mean much, there wasn't any money, but the trophy was nice, and let's admit it, we all like to recognized for our hard work.  I just let it roll off my back, chalked it up to a universal hatred, and moved on.  Two weeks later, I'm called into my managers office.  He wants my opinion on promoting X to a senior developer due to their outstanding work on this project.  Big raise for X, and a jump from junior to senior, and making just 2k less than me after just two years.

So, I told my manager.  ""Hey manager, did you know I wrote all the code for the spellcheck and wrote all the SQL to speed up the KPI reports in super, fantastic, awesome program X wrote?"" 

Manager: ""What, X told me they did that,"" blood drains from Manager's face.

Me: ""Nope, that was me.  X sat in their cubicle for a month trying to figure it out. Two weeks before the release, X asked me to help.  I jumped in an implemented spellcheck and the KPI reports.  The two major features of super, fantastic, awesome program was nominated for.  With no help from X.  X was to busy writing up their nomination form and putting pretty icons on the form.""

Manager: ""Well, uh....it's to late to put you on the nomination.  The trophies are done.""

Me, staring in disbelief: ""Uh manager, I don't care about the trophy, what I'm telling you is X isn't a senior developer, and if X is promoted and making that much, then X will be working on their own while I get my work done.""

I got up and left.  X was promoted, X and the manager got their trophies, and that year they did include a gift card bonus.  Sure it was a $100, but hey, I won't turn down $100 and I confess, I was pissed that I wasn't recognized and treated to a fancy dinner and $100.  

So, true to my word, I stop helping X.  X starts super, fantastic, awesome program number two.  Oversells, over promises, and started lining up their next trophy.  But karma, came knocking on the door.  First, I was put on a project at another site that was behind schedule and over budget.  Word from the top said I was dedicated 100% to this project until it was done--no exceptions.  Second, we were moved out from our local Manager to a regional manager located across the country.  As expected, our local manager sells X as the best developer ever, so Regional manager has high expectations of X.

So as the deadline approached for the next program, X is really under the gun.  A month until launch and all the window dressing is done, but none of the features are implemented.  X does a demo showing the features to come.  Clients get excited, and buzz starts generating for the next award.  X is strutting around bragging about trophy number 3, while I toil away on a project in obscurity.  Two weeks to launch and X doesn't have any features done.  

X: ""So, hey, how would you implement this feature,"" they ask me. 

Me: ""Don't know, I haven't seen your code, and besides, I am project Z until further notice.  You'll have to figure it out.""

X: ""Oh, ok"".

Two hours later, X:""Hey, so, um, if you were do to this, how would you...""

I cut X off, ""Look X, I am on this project 100% of the time.  If you need my time, contact regional manager, get them to approve some of my time to help you and I will. Until then, please don't bother me.""

I sit in my cubicle and listen as X's panic starts to come full boil.  First it was a frantic all to Regional Manager pleading for my time.  From what I hear from my end, that won't happen. But shortly after the call Regional Manager IM's me and asks for me to call them.

I leave to a private room, and call.  Regional Manager is concerned X's project is in trouble, can I fill them in.  I sure do.  I say X was promoted after two years as a very jr. developer to Sr. developer, is over their head and this program isn't going to come close to it's promised actions.  Regional Manager then asks what the program is, I tell them it's a pet project for a single mid level manager here so they can get another trophy.  No it's not important to the company, no it's not critical.  Yes X could be used somewhere else on more important projects.  I do suggest though, albeit nefariously, that X is close to completion and to let them finish it up and release by deadline.  Regional Manager agrees, but I also say I can't help Project Z is close to first release, ""Besides,"" I say, ""X is a sr. developer and capable of this right?""

So, X continues to struggle, I continue to finish Project Z, which did eventually get released and made a big impact dollar wise to the company (but no trophy since the team I was on felt it was more important to finish the job then campaign for trophies).  So X's deadline comes and goes, no release.  Pet Project manager is getting heat.  Pet Project Manager sold this program too and its vaporware.   Regional Manager calls X into a tele-meeting and demotes them back to Jr.  Pay is reduced, and no more projects assigned to X.  X is to work on existing projects until X can prove they are sr. level material.  I left about six months later.  I still keep in contact with some friends from the company. Local Manager took over the management duties again, X is now a lead developer, still programming [VB.NET](https://VB.NET) and chasing the dream of their next trophy.  

I learned a couple of lessons from this.  First, no one is going to toot their horn for you.  If a program you developed, or had a part in, makes a big difference and you want to be recognized, let your manager know.  Send emails, keep a paper trail.  If it isn't to get a trophy, it sure looks good in an interview when you reference specifics in a project.  Second, X was a dick.  You will work with dicks.  The only way to deal with them is understand some people exceed on their merits, other exceed on kissing ass.  It will be easier to look at yourself in the mirror knowing you exceed on your merits and not with a ring of crap around your mouth from kissing ass.",Let's share battle stories. Here one of mine.

5382,2021-04-21 17:50:38,12,1,"Hi all – What happened to the push toward AOT compilation of Java applications? Is it dead? Why?

Two things:

**1) Android**. I remember that Android 5 implemented the Android Runtime (ART), which supported (required?) AOT compiled apps. But the story was always unclear and poorly documented by Google. It looks like true or comprehensive AOT is still not implemented, but it's hard to find details. One issue is that Android 7 switched to OpenJDK, and apparently reintroduced a JIT. But there might have been some JIT-ing even before then – it's not clear, and it's not clear if there are certain parts of apps that are AOT and other parts that are still JIT-compiled.

**2) GraalVM** was [removed from OpenJDK 16](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8255616). So was the jaotc AOT ""feature"" (compiler?) that was introduced in Java 9. (GraalVM was introduced in Java 10.) They say it's due to lack of use or interest in these features.

Is AOT still not a solved problem in some sense? What's the issue? I'm not clear on why Java and C# are so difficult to precompile, relative to something like Go, OCaml, or WebAssembly. Is there not much observed improvement in startup and execution performance?

5401,2021-04-26 12:00:04,13,1,"Hi folks,

Im curious about methods of protecting byte arrays (private keys) against heap dumps. I know a lot of people say if someone has access to perform a heap dump, then it's already too late.  However, I've been reading up on 2 potential safeguards - as mentioned in the post title.

Would a regular java or bouncycastle keystore (held in memory only) protect against this kind of attack? If not, how about a bouncycastle keystore running in FIPS mode?

The other alternative I've seen would be to hold these keys in a GuardedByteArray, which looks like a nice and simple solution without any obvious drawbacks. 

Are there any other solutions I may have missed?

5402,2021-04-26 18:58:04,3,1,"I'm fairly new to Kotlin Multiplatform and I'm trying to rewrite an old Java library to be used for android and ios as a trial run.  The first thing I am encountering is that most Kotlin projects are using the ""java.io""  and ""java.nio"" packages to accomplish reading / writing  and compression / decompression, but this only works for the JVM.  Kotlin Native is not as clear on how this is handled.  

The second issue is that I need to decompress files with either ""bzip2"" or ""lz4"" type compression.  These are a little bit odd formats as they are not widely used by the web, like gzip.  These two types are both supported in the JVM via a couple of 3rd party libraries (apache, etc), but I've haven't found anything to support Kotlin Native.  How would I even accomplish this on ios?  I'm assuming I would have to use interoperability and there would have to be ios/kotlin native specific code to handle, but am not 100% sure.

Recap of my issues:

1. What is the best approach or library to do file I/O in Kotlin Multiplatform?
2. I have some special de-compression needs using ""lz4"", ""bzip2"" for Kotlin Native.  What would be a recommended approach to this problem so I could use existing libraries?",Kotlin Multiplatform - File I/O and de-compression questions

5412,2021-04-28 22:03:29,3,1,"Hi all,

I just added Kotlin support to ***JobRunr*** \- a distributed background processing framework where you can schedule a java 8 lambda (and now also Kotlin functions). It is ideal for long-running tasks, like calculations, consuming webservices, document generation, ... .

An example:

&gt;*BackgroundJob.enqueue { println(""this will be run in the background"") };*

When you launch a background job, the function is analysed and stored into persistent storage (RDBMS or noSql). Next, different background job servers can pick up the different background jobs. JobRunr comes with a built-in dashboard that allows you to monitor all your jobs and failed jobs are automatically retried 10 times with an exponential back-off policy. As it now supports Kotlin, I'm actively looking for some feedback. So if you have some time, I really would appreciate your input and idea's. You can find the github repo at [https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr](https://github.com/jobrunr/jobrunr?fbclid=IwAR0c3d0hRAIFd5A-t0u7E1nqCOio5boYoapAM_A_emy7ifmqp9EfS330mnw).

I kinda still struggle with the syntax of Kotlin especially when I have to do something with the data from a lambda. I'm trying to build a simple REST api for uni project, currently messing with ktor, exposed and moshi. However I'm getting the following error:

    java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No JsonAdapter for class java.util.ArrayList, you should probably use List instead of ArrayList (Moshi only supports the collection interfaces by default) or else register a custom JsonAdapter.

I'm not sure how to solve that, because I do use a List, however my guess is that Kotlin lists are compiled down to java's ArrayList.

From from what I've googled, this should work and be enough, but I guess it's not the case:

    val listType = Types.newParameterizedType(List::class.java, Author::class.java)     
    val moshi = Moshi.Builder().build()

Now this function has a java method that in newer versions of java, but still isn't available in older versions, which you want to/need to continue to support. From everything I've read, this case sounds like a perfect use for multi-release jars.

Currently build tools such as maven run unit tests after the compile phase, meaning you can't unit test a multi-release jar, you have to wait until the verify phase until you can test the jar itself.

Are you now required to migrate unit tests that hit this (potentially coomon) code path to integration test (verify) phase, via mavens failsafe plugin? This seems like unnecessary churn.

It feels like maven still operates under the assumption that testing classes onto the classpath is the same as testing a jar, which doesn't appear to be the case anymore.

Has there been any guidance on how to make the development and testing story around multi release jars easier?

5441,2021-05-07 13:53:31,1,1,"Hello,

Does anybody know about a good tutorial to learn Java, possibly for free? I tried to get through Oracle's content but realised I might need to cover some basic to intermediate topics, first. I used to code in C++ and am familiar with OOP concept including inheritance, composition and polymorphism, templates, some basic design patterns, agile coding and SOLID approach. I have a very good experience in Python and LUA as I did a few projects.

I would like to have something similar to Bruce Eckle's ""_Thinking in C++_"", which I read a long time ago when I was learning C++. The book was fantastic and I learned a lot from that book. I know Bruce also wrote ""_Thinking in Java_"" 4th ed, which only covers Java versions up to SE 5. I came across another Bruce's book ""On Java 8"" (https://leanpub.com/onjava8).

    bitmap.UnlockBits(bitLock);
    return bitmapImageData;

    buffer.Video.AddFrame(FrameToImageData(frame));
}
```

But when code reaches `buffer.Video.AddFrame();` it exits with code `139` without throwing any exception.

I have two test files and only one is causing it. One is `.png` file 100x100 and it works fine. The other is `.png` file 1000x1000 and it makes program exit as soon as it reaches this method.

I'm a CS teacher in a public college in France, and time has come to update our techbase.

We currently teach Java 8, with Netbeans 8.2. This IDE was released in 2017, which was 4 years ago. I feel like it's time to drop it for a newer version, but we would rather not wipe hundreds of PCs if it's still the most widely used version in a professional environment.

We have an internal discussion, on whether to keep the last Oracle's release of Netbeans (ie 8.2), update to latest version (12.3), or even replace it with another IDE.

We feel like it would be best for our students to teach them the tools they'll use later in their career (even if switching from Netbeans to Eclipse or IntelliJ is quite simple), so I'm asking you this quite simple question : which IDE do you use in your current company, and do you know why this one in particular was chosen ?

Our only limitations are ""it must run on Windows 10 without administrator privilege"" and ""it must provide a graphicaal interface for Swing application development"". Maybe budget can be a factor too, though we could definitely buy a few licenses (we are dropping PowerAMC because of its price, so any spending must be justified).

Pros would be : able to manage different languages (our students also learn C and PHP/HTML/JS during their courses), git integration, database integration, javadoc/doxygen integration, maven/unit testing, maybe UML plugins ?

Secondary question : should we switch from java 8 to java 11 next year ?

Thanks a lot for your answers !","Java professionals, which IDE do you use in your daily work ?"

&amp;nbsp;

My work, a big bank, uses a jdk from adoptopenjdk. Teams have to get high level approval if they need Oracle jdk. I believe only important legacy projects use it. Does your work pay for Oracle jdk, or does it use a free version?

&amp;nbsp;

The reason I'm curious, is because Oracle seems to be the largest fininacial contributer to Java. My understanding is that all the core teams are made up of Oracle employees. Also my understanding (Though this predates my professional career) is that java development slowed down drasticly during the final years of Sun Micro, since they couldn't afford to work on Java. Oracle now is investing heavily in Java and it's seems clear that platform is greatly benefiting from it. 

&amp;nbsp;

I suppose my question isn't limited to just Oracle and java. Do companies that make languages actually profit from their development? Or are they loss leaders? I guess there is a third option that the the language solves a problem that would be harder without the language. I'm guessing Mozilla/Rust is in that last category.

5474,2021-05-14 15:07:05,63,1,"As a Scala developer who was I need of some sort windows native GUI  for my pet project, my eye fell upon C# WPF(which, well was in default and i heard about it long time ago). 

So, I found out that compared to like 7-8 years ago C# not changed much. It was an plain old ugly stuff.doBeginDoSideffect; stuf.endDoSideEffect. Now it's just the same, with minor cosmetic changes. 

Some  desing decisions are just unexplainable by any way like: 

1) Semicolon inference.  There's no real point in having thousands of extra symbols of no semantic. Python, Scala, Java script and othe languages have proven this many times

2) Type inference. It is horrible in C# even compared to Java, not mentioning Kotlin or Scala. In java i managed to write code in style where I even rarely need to directly state variable type, thanks to generic inference. In C# ""you cannot define type from usage"" which drives me nuts. Okai I will spend anothe line of code jsut for type decalration. 

3)  Type system inconsistencies. It is even relatively not consistent. Do I typelambda? Do i have variance?  Do I have Top ? Do i have Bottom? Do I have Unit? Do I have propper subtyping? I don't mention discriminated unions, adts, intersections. I understand that CLR will have stroke from processing higher kinds but still erasure is a thing and if not you have type tags. 

4) Lack of typesafe and consistent API which will actually prevent errors. So splitting updates is not a thing, and doing stuff like  s.setFoo(foo); s.setBar(bar); s.setFar(far); is bad because if someone will throw exception between or in setters state will be cranked up and it requires significant additional effort to maintain consistency, but most of APIs are like that, which is crappy. 

Next, why BeginInit() and EndInit() are the things?  Why you even think of initialisation if you don't have all the required stuff?  Why you just cant do this when you'll get all the reuqired items? It is allways possible even if the process of initialisation is complex and long, requires various async processes and might fail. 

And even more, why the're ton of WPF api methods which accept and return object, UIElement and so on?  And why things to get them working require few statements to be written and don't hint in any way that something was left out? This is clearly solvable problem both typeability and atomicity.

5) NULLS. Nulls everywhere, at any place. Rust has proven that nulls are not ""for performance"" and not for ""readbility"". They are just evil and nothing changed in 8 years. 

6)  Concurrency insanity. From looking at method it is not possible to know in any way if it blocking or async and which side effects it will induce, when it will allocate resources and when it will free them. Async/await is just pure evil made to destroy your productivity. How I supposed to know oredering of all this stuff and which concurrency capabilities it utilises? I also see no easy and straightforward means of fine-grain controlling over threads/threadpools/whatever stuff uses. Stuff they use in like things like ImageSource with mixing sync and async stuff is a kind of pure, refined haram despite of being seemingly ""convinient"". 

7) Even VS 2019 hurts editing experience compared to intellij idea and there are no plugins to fix that. Autosave? No, you are the slave of Ctrl+S. Local file changelog? No, forget about it, use git for every sneeze.

 4 button hotkeys for most routine and simple things are just insane Ctrl+/ and Ctrl+\* for both comment and uncomment? No, they are just for lazies, true programmers play piano Ctrl+K, Ctrl+C. Multicareting - no, this is forbidden. 

In intelliJ I can find all the stuff from sources but M$ seems to protect its precious ~~garbage~~value so I can't just look at implimentation just by cliking and looking. 

8)  Gui obsession. I can't see easy way of doing everything as code(i.e. build, resources, dependencies e.t.c.)

Will they fix something or they just don't give a shit?",Are C# and visual studio stuck at 2000s?

## Supported models

1. [**ACL (Access Control List)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list)
2. **ACL with [superuser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser)**
3. **ACL without users**: especially useful for systems that don't have authentication or user log-ins.
3. **ACL without resources**: some scenarios may target for a type of resources instead of an individual resource by using permissions like ``write-article``, ``read-log``. It doesn't control the access to a specific article or log.
4. **[RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)**
5. **RBAC with resource roles**: both users and resources can have roles (or groups) at the same time.
6. **RBAC with domains/tenants**: users can have different role sets for different domains/tenants.
7. **[ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-Based_Access_Control)**: syntax sugar like ``resource.Owner`` can be used to get the attribute for a resource.
8. **[RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)**: supports paths like ``/res/*``, ``/res/:id`` and HTTP methods like ``GET``, ``POST``, ``PUT``, ``DELETE``.
9. **Deny-override**: both allow and deny authorizations are supported, deny overrides the allow.
10. **Priority**: the policy rules can be prioritized like firewall rules.

## How it works?

In Casbin, an access control model is abstracted into a CONF file based on the **PERM metamodel (Policy, Effect, Request, Matchers)**. So switching or upgrading the authorization mechanism for a project is just as simple as modifying a configuration. You can customize your own access control model by combining the available models. For example, you can get RBAC roles and ABAC attributes together inside one model and share one set of policy rules.

The most basic and simplest model in Casbin is ACL. ACL's model CONF is:

```ini
# Request definition
[request_definition]
r = sub, obj, act

# Policy definition
[policy_definition]
p = sub, obj, act

# Policy effect
[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

# Matchers
[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act

```

An example policy for ACL model is like:

```
p, alice, data1, read
p, bob, data2, write
```

It means:

- alice can read data1
- bob can write data2

We also support multi-line mode by appending '\\'  in the end:  

```ini
# Matchers
[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj \ 
  &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act
```

Further more, if you are using ABAC,  you can try operator `in` like following in Casbin **golang** edition (jCasbin and Node-Casbin are not supported yet):

```ini
# Matchers
[matchers]
m = r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act || r.obj in ('data2', 'data3')
```

But you **SHOULD** make sure that the length of the array is **MORE** than **1**, otherwise there will cause it to panic.

For more operators, you may take a look at [govaluate](https://github.com/Knetic/govaluate)

## Features

What Casbin does:

1. enforce the policy in the classic ``{subject, object, action}`` form or a customized form as you defined, both allow and deny authorizations are supported.
2. handle the storage of the access control model and its policy.
3. manage the role-user mappings and role-role mappings (aka role hierarchy in RBAC).
4. support built-in superuser like ``root`` or ``administrator``. A superuser can do anything without explict permissions.
5. multiple built-in operators to support the rule matching. For example, ``keyMatch`` can map a resource key ``/foo/bar`` to the pattern ``/foo*``.

What Casbin does NOT do:

1. authentication (aka verify ``username`` and ``password`` when a user logs in)
2. manage the list of users or roles. I believe it's more convenient for the project itself to manage these entities. Users usually have their passwords, and Casbin is not designed as a password container. However, Casbin stores the user-role mapping for the RBAC scenario. 

## Installation

```
pip install casbin
```

## Documentation

https://casbin.org/docs/en/overview

## Online editor

You can also use the online editor (http://casbin.org/editor/) to write your Casbin model and policy in your web browser. It provides functionality such as ``syntax highlighting`` and ``code completion``, just like an IDE for a programming language.

## Tutorials

https://casbin.org/docs/en/tutorials

## Get started

1. New a Casbin enforcer with a model file and a policy file:

```python
import casbin
e = casbin.Enforcer(""path/to/model.conf"", ""path/to/policy.csv"")
```

Note: you can also initialize an enforcer with policy in DB instead of file, see [Persistence](#persistence) section for details.

2. Add an enforcement hook into your code right before the access happens:

```python
sub = ""alice""  # the user that wants to access a resource.
obj = ""data1""  # the resource that is going to be accessed.
act = ""read""  # the operation that the user performs on the resource.

if e.enforce(sub, obj, act):
    # permit alice to read data1
    pass
else:
    # deny the request, show an error
    pass
```

3. Besides the static policy file, Casbin also provides API for permission management at run-time. For example, You can get all the roles assigned to a user as below:

```python
roles = e.get_roles_for_user(""alice"")
```

See [Policy management APIs](#policy-management) for more usage.

4. Please refer to the ``tests`` files for more usage.

## Policy management

Casbin provides two sets of APIs to manage permissions:

- [Management API](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/management_api.go): the primitive API that provides full support for Casbin policy management. See [here](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/management_api_test.go) for examples.
- [RBAC API](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/rbac_api.go): a more friendly API for RBAC. This API is a subset of Management API. The RBAC users could use this API to simplify the code. See [here](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/rbac_api_test.go) for examples.

We also provide a web-based UI for model management and policy management:

5513,2021-05-24 14:08:16,21,1,"Here is my collection of some of the useful third-party libraries Java developers can use in their application to do a lot of useful tasks.

**1. Unit Testing Libraries JUnit and Mockito**

Unit testing is the single most important thing that separates an average developer from a good developer. Programmers often are given excuses for not writing unit tests, but the most common excuse for avoiding unit testing is lack of experience and knowledge of popular unit testing libraries, including JUnit, Mockito, and PowerMock.

If you want to learn JUnit and Mockito and you need a resource, I highly recommend Learn Java Unit Testing with Junit &amp; Mockito in 30 Steps by Ranga Karnam on [Udemy](https://exceed-team.com/udemy). It’s a great, hands-on course to learn these useful libraries.

**2. JSON Parsing libraries Jackson and Gson**

In today’s world of web services and IoT, JSON has become the go-to protocol to carry information from the client to the server. They have replaced the XML as the most preferred way to transfer information in a platform-independent way.

Unfortunately, JDK doesn’t have a JSON library. But, there are many good third-party libraries that allow you to both parse and create JSON messages, like Jackson and Gson. A Java web developer should be familiar with at least one of these libraries.

**3. Logging Libraries Log4j2 and SLF4j**

Logging libraries are very common because you need them in every project. They are the most important thing for server-side applications because logs are only placed where you can see what’s going on in your application.

Even though JDK ships with its own logging library, there are better alternatives available, like Log4j, SLF4j, and LogBack.

If you are interested to learn more bout logging in to Java then I highly recommend you Java Core Libraries: Java Log System course on Pluralsight.

This is a rare course to learn about when to use logging, why use logging, and how to generate useful log messages. It will also teach you how to use the Java Log System for logging and give you some back practices for logging in your application as well.

**4. XML Parsing Libraries Xerces and JAXB**

There are many XML parsing libraries, including Xerces, JAXB, JAXP, Dom4j, and Xstream. Xerces2 is the next generation of high-performance, fully compliant XML parsers in the Apache Xerces family.

This new version of Xerces introduces the Xerces Native Interface (XNI), a complete framework for building parser components and configurations that is extremely modular and easy to program.

The Apache Xerces2 parser is the reference implementation of XNI, but other parser components, configurations, and parsers can be written using the Xerces Native Interface. Dom4j is another flexible XML framework for Java applications.

That’s all for now about some of the useful libraries every Java developer should be using. The Java sphere is vast, and you will find tons of libraries for doing different things.

If you want to do anything in [Java](https://exceed-team.com/tech/10-awesome-Java-libraries-and-APIs-that-every-programmer-should-know?s=re&amp;a=a), more than likely, you will find a library on how to do just that.

As far as I remember my first interaction with Java and Eclipse already ended in pain: Nonsensical error messages, stack overflow users talking about extremely advanced solutions, different solutions for different java versions, jdk or jre...

Then suddenly things just work. I even managed to use the provided maven stuff an junit and it worked pretty well after the first pain.

Then the second semester happened and with that came JavaFX. Downloading additional software, trying to get it to work with the provided maven project, not knowing that you have to set a ""goal: javafx:run"" for whatever reason. If it suddenly works I don't touch anything and cross my fingers. In the first few weeks I think I managed to run the class project exactly once. Everything I learned came from listening and not from actually working.

A few weeks later and I'm behind. The class advanced and there's a newer version of the project available. I try to run my old program and figure out the changes (we had to add threads) myself before I look into the solution. It doesn't work. All I get is a stinky error saying that javafx is missing even though it's installed. No idea where to start to find out where the error is caused. The current version of the program is also not executable because ""the import javafx cannot be resolved"".

5528,2021-05-29 17:51:58,4,1,"Here is my attempt at providing what I believe are the 3 most important principles for writing maintainable code. Reposted from r/java but also applies to C#.

**1. Good data models**

""Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won't usually need your flowcharts; they'll be obvious."" -- Fred Brooks. Data is the core of programming. With that said, there are two main sub principles. The first one is Minimize the possibility of inconsistent state. A simple example would be using an integer to represent a boolean value with one equals true and zero equals false. All that does is make your code more error prone and harder to understand. Another example would be having an employee class containing the boolean field isStillEmployed in addition to the nullable date field EndDate. You can infer if an employee is still employed by if their EndDate is null. This allows for an inconsistent state which is inherently error prone. The second sub principle of good data models is to keep your data types consistent, for example using the same data types in the front end and the back end. The alternative is to store the same data differently and constantly translate between the two, but this just adds unnecessary complexity.

**2. Address immediate problems**

This is also known as “You might need it later syndrome”. A lot of principles taught in college violate this principle. ~~Add getters and setters because they might change later.~~ Extract a section of code into a separate method or even class because it might need to be reused later. Write unit tests because it might catch a bug later. You probably won’t need them, and if you ever do, you can add them later. It is not that you should never use those things, but only if there is a tangible purpose instead of some hypothetical future benefit. An example of another type of “you might need it later syndrome” is one solution to the FizzBuzz problem where instead of doing the simple solution of iterating over the four possibilities of Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz, and current number, they make a solution where they can easily add more words with corresponding remainders to expand the game. The rules of FizzBuzz aren’t going to change any time soon and all you did was create a more convoluted solution.

**3. Minimize shared mutable state**

A common scenario in code bases is that programmers start with a long method, and then decide to break it up into several smaller methods for best practice. Afterwards, they realize that now they have to repeatedly pass on the same parameters between the new smaller methods. To fix this they move the parameter into a private field within the class. In addition to polluting the class as a data type, this creates the problem of shared mutable state. You have no way of easily knowing which methods could modify these temporary properties making it difficult to track how state changes in the code. This makes code less readable and more error prone.

**Summary**

If you follow these three principles, although it will not make you the perfect programmer, it will make sure your code is maintainable. Your code will still have imperfections, but at least the flaws will be easily fixable. For example, badly naming a variable or method will make your code less readable, but with modern IDE’s it is simple to fix, as opposed to the three principles I listed which require a major code rewrite to fix.",Top 3 principles for writing maintainable code

I've seen developers create new applications with dependencies from 2014 when current versions exist that were just released.

It drives me mental. Any time I work on a release I look at the dependencies in the application and I upgrade them. If something requires a major rewrite/refactor I might leave it for another day and create a backlog item for it and make it part of a larger release but come on, why are more developers not doing this?

5558,2021-06-05 13:16:54,7,1,"Hello folks, My problem is I made a function named forEachLevelOrderTraversal which simply traverses the tree nodes using level order traversal. Then I have to make another function that searches a particular node in a tree and returns it. So, in this search function, I used that forEachLevelOrderTraversal because it traverses the nodes. I found my value but the function is returning the out-of-bound exception...

`class TreeNode&lt;T&gt;(val value: T) {`

`private val children: MutableList&lt;TreeNode&lt;T&gt;&gt; = mutableListOf()`

`fun addChild(child: TreeNode&lt;T&gt;) = children.add(child)`

`private fun forEachLevelOrderTraversal(visit: Visitor&lt;T&gt;){`  
`visit(this)`  
 `val queue =  ArrayListQueue&lt;TreeNode&lt;T&gt;&gt;()`  
 `children.forEach { queue.enqueue(it) }`  
 `var node = queue.dequeue()`  
 `while (node!=null){`  
`visit(node)`  
 `node.children.forEach { queue.enqueue(it) }`  
 `node = queue.dequeue()`  
`}`  
`}`

We use a queue to ensure that nodes are visited in the right level order. You start visiting the current node and putting all its children into the queue. Then you start consuming the queue until it's empty. Every time you visit a node, you also put all its children into the queue. This ensures that all node at the same level is visited one after the other.

then the search function...

`fun search(value: T):TreeNode&lt;T&gt;{`  
 `var result: TreeNode&lt;T&gt;? = null`  
 `forEachLevelOrderTraversal {`  
 `if (it.value == value){`  
 `result = it`  
`}`  
`}`  
 `return result!!`  
`}}`

I debug the code it works great till the result = it but after this that forEachLevelOrderTraversal() must stop and return but it's not stopping &amp; again start iterating over the leftover nodes in the forEachLevelOrderTraversal() until I got this error... PLEAS GUIDE

5571,2021-06-11 05:32:18,5,1,"I wrote a gRPC service using [jasync](https://github.com/jasync-sql/jasync-sql) for asynchronous database queries. The server worked fine, but I found some interesting facts.

1. If I used the default executor, gRPC service would run its works on its own executor, while jasync would run on standard ForkJoinPool, resulting in two worker thread pools having a double number of threads than the ideal number. Luckily executor could be configured to ensure only one worker thread pool is created.
2. jasync and gRPC both had their own event loop group, even both of them were the netty's one. You can see the creation of the event loop group [here](https://github.com/jasync-sql/jasync-sql/blob/master/db-async-common/src/main/java/com/github/jasync/sql/db/util/NettyUtils.kt#L38) and [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/netty/src/main/java/io/grpc/netty/Utils.java#L84).

This is something that I've never seen in .NET^(\[1\]), Node and Golang. My question is, is it a deliberate design? If it is, why? If it is not, how much it costs?

\[1\] Of course in .NET you **can** create your own worker thread pool and event loop. But AFAIK none of the serious frameworks actually does it. Instead they just use the shared one provided by .NET.",A question about asynchronous programming ecosystem: why each of the frameworks tends to create their own event loop and executor thread pool?

5605,2021-06-24 22:50:10,2,1," 

I'm using tomcat 9 and i cant get JSTL tags to work. I tried every  solution out there and nothing seems to work. I;m on the verge of giving  up my 3 months long JSP studies because of this. Nothing I tried makes  it work.

I am notsure what is cuasing this, i'm very confused. Am I using the  correct JSTL version with Tomcat 9? ? I'm not sure which version of JSTL  is compatible with Tomcat 9. Also, i'm not sure which version of  web.xml I should use with Tomcat 9. I am not using maven.

**EDIT:**

I finally was able to resolve the functionality of JSTL tags in my  result.jsp file by downloading and adding into my WEB-INF/lib folder the  latest jstl-1.2.jar. So I was able to make the standard forEach tag to  work but I am not able to retreive my array from the servlet. I suspect  it has something to do with my web.xml version specifications, I am  using Tomcat 7 and jstl-1.2.

What would be the appropriate web.xml configurtions in my case?

I get this error

I've been working with open source since 2014, and I've launched a couple of moderately successful projects. One thing that keeps coming up when talking to people about my projects is that they don't think they can ""trust"" them, but I seldom get one definite answer as to why. The most popular reason is probably ""It's community driven, there is no organization driving the project"", which I can see both as a good thing and a bad thing. I'm curious what the community's thoughts on this is, and what I can do to increase trust in the projects I'm currently maintaining. I have some metrics that I personally look at when I choose projects to start using: 

* Number of open issues/PR, and how the maintainers interact with the community
* Frequency of commits
* If builds are failing a lot (or at all)
* If it follows semver
* What dependencies a project has
* Number of downloads/stars/contributors
* What companies use the project
* How ""nice"" the website or GitHub readme looks
* Number of tests (I don't actually look at this, but maybe I should?)

What do you look at when choosing an open source project? What *don't* you look at? Would it be better if a project promoted these metrics clearly in the readme or on the website? Any other thoughts?",What makes you trust (or distrust) an open source project?

5617,2021-06-29 10:40:44,121,1,"Ideally every project out there would be using the newest Java version or at least the latest LTS. Of course that's not how it is in the real world, which leads to two contradicting goals when deciding which version to write a completely new library in:

1. The ability to use newer language features
2. The most amount of availability possible

Put differently, as a library designer you want to be able to make use of the newest language features and support as well as have the largest possible userbase.

These are the releases I am considering at the moment:

* 8 (widely used)
* 9 (modules)
* 11 (latest LTS)
* 16 and upgrade to 17 later (newest languages features + soon to be LTS)

In my opinion, modules are a must-have for new libraries (at least for the one I am writing right now), so Java 8 is not an option.

Java 9 probably has a larger userbase than 11, although I have never actually heard of anyone using it in production - only ever Java 8.

Java 16/17 probably won't be widely used for a long time, thereby making it harder for the library to gain traction, especially with cross-compilation not being a thing in javac.

So with all of this said, I am currently leaning towards Java 11, but am very unsure about the decision. What do you think?",What version should new Java libraries be written in?

5628,2021-07-03 07:51:01,5,1,"I've recently learned about this pattern from [this article](https://blog.stylingandroid.com/kotlin-mutability/). I've found it extremely useful for my own personal projects because I don't have to create separate immutable/mutable classes. The read logic is shared amongst immutable/mutable classes so I don't need to copy and paste them.

I've also extended it to also provide a `View` of the data. Which is basically a read only wrapper around mutable data. Here's an example:

Notes: 

* The caller doesn't have access to the `tiles` field since it's protected. 
* Methods that mutate the underlying data are only found under the `Mutable` class. 
* There are methods for converting between Immutable &lt;-&gt; Mutable &lt;-&gt; View classes.
* The Immutable class is a deep copy of the original data. So changes to the original data doesn't affect this class.

***First: I am not posting to say that Java is dead...quite the opposite. I like Kotlin and want to do more with it...I just was curious for what some professionals out there might say. I've seen so many conflicting opinions on the below, so I thought I'd just post here.***

**Part 1: Java 8**

Looking to the heavy usage on Java 8 (see the [Jetbrains Dev Survey](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2020/java/)), I was wondering what this will mean for the future of Java (and, by extension, Kotlin)?

I get the licensing and the long-term support on Java 8, but I am wondering what this will mean for the future.

When it comes time to upgrade company stacks from Java 8 (which was released in 2014) to stay current, will we see...

...a mass movement away from Java in web development to something like Python or Go when it comes time to make those large, application wide changes/upgrades. 

OR

...a big adoption of something like Kotlin when doing these upgrades (it was designed as a replacement, after all) and maybe even use of something like Kotlin or Scala as the primary language

OR

...or just a mass movement to another LTS release

**Part 2: Google's Fuchsia** 

Looking at the supported [languages for Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/languages), I see that Java/Kotlin are not on the list. I don't really see it replacing Android without supporting a lot of Android apps that use the JVM, so where does this leave Kotlin and the JVM? From what I've read, there isn't an official long-term plan yet, but is part of a plan to ditch Java (I am also aware of the lawsuit with Oracle)?

What happens to Kotlin in this scenario? does it just become more of a desktop and web focused language? I'm not saying that Fuchsia will replace Android for certain, but I'm sure it is a least under consideration. There is also the chance it just becomes something like ChromeOS for IOT or something like that.

5667,2021-07-13 22:57:18,5,1,"Hello, I'm using retrofit to parse a json response but I'm not sure how to access a field in the nested response.
The response has a ""results"" field that leads to other fields (many, depending on the query, but I limited it to 10 in my case), that have their own nested fields I want to access, image_url in particular (this is the api: https://api.jikan.moe/v3/search/anime?q=free).

I have written these classes to handle the response (not sure if I should consider the results a list to begin with):
```
data class AnimeResponse(
    @SerializedName(""results"") val results: List&lt;AnimeResultsResponse&gt;
)

data class AnimeResultsResponse(
    @SerializedName(""mal_id"") var mal_id: String,
    @SerializedName(""url"") var url: String,

    @SerializedName(""end_date"") var end_date: String,
    @SerializedName(""member"") var member: Int,
    @SerializedName(""rated"") var rated: String
)
```
The results field does lead to a list, I believe, but the list then has these dictionaries so I'm confused as to how to deal with it, any advices on that would be appreciated.

Then I manage the get request in another file:
```
interface APIService {
    @GET
    suspend fun getAnimeByCategory(@Url url:String):Response&lt;AnimeResponse&gt;
}
```

```
private fun getRetrofit():Retrofit{
        return Retrofit.Builder()
            .baseUrl(""https://api.jikan.moe/v3/search/anime?q="")

What projects would be a good time killer for someone working with a god awful school Chromebook and online IDE? My experience level is basically the first semester of a college coding course.

(I should probably do a text adventure game, see what I can do in terms of snake, pong, and breakout, but after that I have no clue.)

So this coming school year I'm going to be a senior in high school. Last year I took the first semester of my state's public university system's computer science courses. I had a ton of fun and really enjoyed working on some side projects but part of that time I was working with a really good desktop computer in the class. Now I only have my laptop and the repl.it IDE to work with.
I'm not going to have any coding classes this year and I really can't imagine having to go a full year without having any projects to work on.

So what ideas do you guys and gals have for projects that could run on very low-end hardware? I don't have the greatest scope on the capabilities, honestly, but anything much more complicated than snake might not go very well because of how the IDE's display works. I tried doing some turtle draw thing in Python with it for a different class and it was pretty bad.

Other ideas I had include learning more in java, learning how to do what I can do in java in C, and learning JavaScript and using P5.js (but that feels like cheating with how simple it is).

I'm just really not looking forward to this year. It feels like a waste of time but if I had programs to make I think I'll survive.

 ` ` `",How to pass data between activities (that wasn't bound to any view yet)
5689,2021-07-18 16:28:21,8,1,"Hello, I have this app where I have a recycler view that gets the images and titles of news. Then, when the user clicks on the image, the news is supposed to open and show the image, title and then the author and description of the news. The thing is, the author and the description were not on the recycler view and I want to add them to the second activity that shows the detail of the news. How can I do that since the data isn't bound to any view yet and, therefore, I can't pass it through an intent (I think)?

This is my recycler adapter with the setOnClickListener that triggers the second activity:
```
package com.example.newsapp

class RecyclerAdapter (
    private var Titles: List&lt;String&gt;,
    private var Images: List&lt;String&gt;,
    private var Authors: List&lt;String&gt;,
    private var Descriptions: List&lt;String&gt;
        ) : RecyclerView.Adapter&lt;RecyclerAdapter.ViewHolder&gt;(){

            inner class ViewHolder(
                view: View
            ): RecyclerView.ViewHolder(view){
                private val binding = NewsItemBinding.bind(view)

                val itemTitle: TextView = binding.tvTitle
                val itemImage: ImageView = binding.ivNewsImage

                fun bind(urlToImage:String){
                    Picasso.get().load(urlToImage).into(binding.ivNewsImage)
                }


                init {
                    itemImage.setOnClickListener{
                        val intent = Intent(view.context, PostActivity::class.java)
                        intent.putExtra(""title"",itemTitle.text)
                        intent.putExtra(""source"",)
                        view.context.startActivity(intent)
                    }
                }
            }

    override fun onCreateViewHolder(parent: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): ViewHolder {
        val v = LayoutInflater.from(parent.context).inflate(R.layout.news_item, parent, false)
        return ViewHolder(v)
    }

    override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {
        holder.itemTitle.text = Titles[position]
        val itemImage = Images[position]
        holder.bind(itemImage)

    }

    override fun getItemCount(): Int {
        return Titles.size
    }
}
```

This is the second activity that needs to have the extra details:
```
package com.example.newsapp

import android.media.Image
import android.os.Bundle
import android.widget.TextView
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import com.example.newsapp.databinding.ActivityPostBinding

        setContentView(R.layout.activity_post)
        binding = ActivityPostBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        val view = binding.root
        setContentView(view)

        //get title
        var detailTitle = intent.getStringExtra(""title"")
        binding.tvTitleItem.text = detailTitle

        //get image
        
        //get author
        
        //get description
    }
}
```

This is the API response:

For experimental purpose, I managed to initialize Jetpack Compose purely by OpenGL context. 

In points to get such integration I had to do:

1) initialization of the window and graphics context, here I have chosen OpenGL via GLFW

2) initialization of a Skija context from a previously created Opengl context

3) creating a UI thread e.g looper like in Android and implementing a new dispatcher for coroutines

4) integrating jetpack-compose with UI thread, Skija context and inputs coming from GLFW

5) copy and modify more than 60 internal classes in jetpack compose(the most tough point)

And here is OpenGL/Jetpack Compose(Skija)/imgui-java drawing together.

What is the best approach to separate the logic between handling these client connections while also making sure they are connected to the proper game instance, while simultaneously not tightly coupling the server/connection code to the game engine?

If each game room has its own loop running in its own thread, how would I pass along user input from the main thread into a sub thread running a game instance?

Sorry if this is vague, but I'm having trouble visualizing how to achieve this in a clean way.",How to properly handle input/output for multiple instances of a Java game?

Records accessors are just `x()` instead of `getX()` and pritive objects in their preview also follow getter without get prefix pattern.

At first I was going to pick Java because I thought it would be easier, but I found out from researching online that C# and Java are very similar in many ways. I'd like to know what ways C# is ""better"" or different than Java in your opinion or why you would choose C# over java nowadays.

So far from what I understand or both languages are this:

\- C# has a cleaner license &amp; business model. I've heard about Java being a nightmare to use because of licensing and legality that Oracle has tied to the language. I personally haven't been affected by this because I install Java from the Azul Zulu builds (OpenJDK).

\- C# feels like a newer language with newer features and functionality, but I personally have no idea which features are better implement than Java (I'd love to hear specifics on this one).

\- Java has a powerful VM (JVM), which is used by other languages like Kotlin and Scala, for example.

\- Java has a larger ecosystem of learning material and frameworks, etc. This is of course because of the age gap of the languages.

These are just a few things that I've noticed while comparing both C# and Java. I personally like C# but I can't help but feel like Java would be a good choice too. Am I making the right choice by going with C#? Do you think that C# will be the language for the future in the spaces that Java occupy in tech?

I just find how similar both languages are confusing and I'd really like to know more about C# and why it could be a better choice over Java so I can make my final decision before taking the class.",In what ways is C# better than Java?

When that's done, the application has to write all the Javadoc comments into a sperate text file, with each comment being followed by the class or method name that it belongs to. The name of the input .java to be processed should be specified by a -i command line argument, and the name of the output text file should be specified by a -o command line argument.

Finally, the application has to print info about the class and methods in the .java file: First, the name of the class in the java file, followed by the author's nameAnd second,  for each method it should print to the console the name of the method, followed by details of any of its parameters as specified by @ param tags, and details of what it returns as specified by @ return tags.

For its size (150 kb jar with no dependencies) it's quite packed with features, including those of a ""real"" database, like journaling. It can operate as in-memory or file-backed off-heap storage, with a peak performance of 5-10 MOp/sec, and average 1 MOp/sec.

I wrote its core few years ago as a part of open-source research project, then it evolved as a part of a commercial project, where it was powering a custom file system, and finally I forked it as an independent opensource project.

I hope to fix it quite soon. The original version used a native memory implementation, so this fix wasn't needed.

- Missing is an utility to repair a corrupt database.

Along with Java and C++, Kotlin is a programming language for Android. According to Google, more than 50% of professional Android app developers use Kotlin to develop their Android applications. Meaning that, it is one of the most loved programming languages worldwide. Besides, it is also expected that Kotlin may even change how Java is used on the server. 

Means,if you are an android developer or going to develop android app,  you must know the Kotlin programming language for effective apps development. The best advantage of Kotlin is lesser number of lines of code. Along with this, there are many more useful kotlin features that you should know if you are going to develop an android app. Here we’ll discuss those important features but before digging to it, let’s see the benefits of Kotlin over Java.

## Benefits Of Kotlin Over Java-

Kotlin is designed by JetBrains to overcome the challenges of Java. And hence, gradually it is replacing Java in ANDROID app development. Here’s a list of benefits of Kotlin over Java.

* **Easy To Maintain-** The statically typed programming language support a wide range of IDEs, importantly Android Studio.
* **Advanced Compiler-** Kotlin has a smart compiler. It can detect errors to compile time and perform a check to reduce runtime errors.
* **Fail-Safe System-** As the code is compact, the chances of error are less. Besides, there are some app crashes and system failures incidents with Kotlin.
* **Interoperability With Java-** It has tools and frameworks compatible with Java.
* **Concise And Clear-** Kotlin for android app development is clear, concise and practical. Kotlin extensions are part of Android Jetpack family which helps to optimize android platform APIs, and Jetpack for Kotlin use.

JetBrains has kept its language design clean and made the syntax simple. Besides, it takes very less time to write the code that improves the developer’s productivity.  As an android developer, you should know these Top 7 Kotlin features that make android app faster, easier and error-free.

## Must Know Kotlin Features For Android App Development

 

### 1. Null Safety In Kotlin-

Each Java developer must have been frustrated by NPE (NullPointerException) at some point in time. Special Null value can be assigned to object reference and NullPointerException, a RuntimeException is thrown when a program tries to use object reference that has null value. Exception can prematurely terminate the program. As Java doesn’t provide any information about the object not created by developer has no null value, during the compilation time it put unnecessary pressure on java developer to keep the program null safe. 

But when you use Kotlin, no need to worry about this. Kotlin has a null-safety feature at the starting age, that is by determining that values will be assigned to the null factor or not. Kotlin’s compiler is powered by null-safe feature which improves run-time Null Point Exceptions encounters.

### 2. Lazy-Loading Feature-

Faster loading time is one of the most important criteria for any quality app and Kotlin’s lazy loading feature takes care of this. While using Kotlin for android development, this feature will help you to minimize the startup time for the app. It loads the initial content faster to reduce startup to reduce startup time while slowly leading other less necessary elements and contents down the page. Because of this lazy loading feature, android developers who work with Kotlin can just give the priority to the primary resources and keep them in main memory to ensure faster loading while keeping others or secondary resources in secondary memories.

### 3. Standard Library Functions-

Developers can use standard library functions offered by Kotlin programming language. It eases implementation of higher-order functions with idiomatic patterns like apply, let, use and so on. Also, it has lost of utilities to work with char and string sequences. Its Extension functions provide query operations for sequences and collections. Kotlin’s JDK classes made working convenient with IO, files, and threading.

### 4. Data Classes In Kotlin-

The need of a class is always argued by programming language designers/makers. Generally, a data class in java contains huge boilerplate code that developers should skip so as to find out the real use of that class. However in Kotlin, Android developers can write the equivalent of the same Java code very simply with less code. So, data classes in Kotlin are known as one of the useful features.

### 5. String Interpolation-

String interpolation is done through string literals having placeholders that are assessed to achieve a result where placeholders are replaced with corresponding values. Mostly string handling in Java is difficult, that include the use of plus operators, String.format, and StringBuffer. The simple process of String interpolation in Kotlin becomes complex for Java developers.

Know the amazing IDEs and Text Editors at- [**Kotlin IDEs And Text Editors That You Must Know**](https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/kotlin-ides-and-text-editors-that-you-must-know-in-2020/)

### 6. Collections And Streams-

Java developers must have an idea of processing object collections that are important in the Java app development process. This happens because Java objects get translated to various presented elements through this process. Mostly this causes a parallel stream of translated objects which results in slowing down the application. As a modern programming language, Kotlin handles this with immutable collections. Here, rich functional APIs will consequently return as the collections are characterized by the unique functionality..

### 7. Extension Functions-

 

Extensions of Kotlin are very useful, this is so because they allow developers to add methods to classes without changing source code. Similar to Scala’s implicit methods, in Kotlin developer can add methods on a per-user basis to classes. For instance, have you tried activity has some methods such as Hidekeyboard()? With extensions, developers can do it like this-

    fun Activity.hideKeyboard(): Boolean { val view = currentFocus view?.let { val inputMethodManager = getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE) as InputMethodManager return inputMethodManager.hideSoftInputFromWindow(view.windowToken, InputMethodManager.HIDE_NOT_ALWAYS) } return false }

Truth be told, with Kotlin extensions there is no need to have utility methods or classes, which can improve the readability of your code tremendously.

## Features That Kotlin Has But Not Java-

There are some features that Kotlin has but not Java, and so Kotlin is an ideal choice for android app development over Java.

* Primary constructors
* Smart casts
* Data classes
* First-class delegation
* Operator overloading
* Type inference for variable and property types
* Coroutines
* Companion objects
* String templates
* Operator overloading
* Singletons
* Separate interfaces for read-only and mutable collections
* Declaration-site variance &amp; Type projections
* Lambda expressions and inline functions (i.e., performant custom control structures)
* Range expressions
* Extension functions

5799,2021-08-19 16:36:57,14,1,"I am not asking for specific guidance or trying to solve a problem. I have a question about the design of my workplace's webserver and how it compares to what the industry is currently doing.

We use the [Spark Java](https://sparkjava.com/) framework for REST API endpoints. In our main method we import the library as static and create endpoints as shown in their getting started guide and declare static handlers for GETs and POSTs, etc inside main. This seems fine to me so far (please let me know if you know of any issues with this).

We have a bunch of controllers with static routes mapped to these handlers. Around 90% of methods and variables used in these routes are static and we only instantiate new objects which are scoped to that route or inside a static method.

My questions are:

1. Is it normal for REST webservers to be fully static?
2. What are the benefits and costs (or risks) of doing it this way?
3. Is there an alternative I should know about re: static-ness of webservers? (This is my first backend dev job)
4. Does anyone have an opinion on whether Spark is good, bad, neutral?
5. What do most people in the industry use? (My guess is Spring Boot, but IDK much about that)

So I am used to a lot of conformable compiling, there is just one Compiler (there are more but the result is more or less the same) and you get a file that runs on every (tm) machine. I have one command to compile and Tools that use this command.

Now I understand the nature of Java is completely different than cpp. But I am very confused by the Windows Compiler chain... Stuff.

I do understand that cpp needs to be compile for every os+CPU combination, but this doesn't explains to my why there are 10 ways to compile cpp. 50% of the time I Google the answer includes visual Studio,and this is the most convoluted thing imo. Why is cpp development so extremely tight bound to an IDE. I dont want to use vs, but it seems there is hardly a way around it.

So sorry if this comes of as a rant. I like cpp as a language but the compiling liking etc etc seems very bumpy and unconfortable. So my concrete questions are:

* Why does VS pops up every where and seems hard to avoid?
* why is there no cross platform gcc (like `gcc file.cpp --platform win --arch arm32`) eg. A Compiler that can compile for every platform (seperately)?
* can I just avoid any of the in my eyes convoluted Systems by using `llvm`? I like the approach a lot and it seems to be the closest to the question bevore
* What is the most modern way to compile cpp (all platform)

Also when talking about compiling dependencies are a huge topic, that needs to be taken care of. And again Windows seems to brew his own soup here. What is the best universal way to deal with dependencies? I read that there are package repos like maven for Java. (conjar or something along the lines)

* What is the best way to deal with libs? (or most modern /sustainable) 
* How to ship libs right? Again Windows says: ""dont worry just use visual Studio Hit Button and it might works"" YIKES 

For Linux it seems a lot more... calm. While there is more than one Compiler, non of them is bound to an ide. They are JUST A COMPILER. And still there are many ways to compile it. Gcc, cpp, llvm and I am sure I just scratched the surface. 

And don't get me started in MinGW, Cywin etc. They are also a source of confusion (which I would be more than just happy to get rid of with Your help)",Is cpp compiling in windows a mess or is it just my head?
5808,2021-08-23 12:16:51,90,1,"Note to mods: this is more of a discussion rather than techincal programming help.

Summary of the JavaDoc:

`IllegalAccessException` is an exception that is thrown when you try to access fields, constructors and more through reflection, but the currently executing method does not have access to the definition of the specified class, field, method or constructor.

An example reflection access would look like this:

```
var field = yourObject.getClass().getField(""someAttribute"");
// the field data can be private, but you can still access it with:
field.setAccessible(true)
var fieldData = field.get(yourObject);
```

Up to Java 15 it isn't acutally thrown but this warning comes up in the console:

```
WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
WARNING: Illegal reflective access by example.package to field java.lang.Enum.name
WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of example.package
WARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal reflective access operations
WARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release
```

In Version 16 the default setting is that all illegal access operations are ""denied"", meaning it throws an exception and you cannot use it. You can still allow it with a JVM parameter `--illegal-access=permit`, but I have heard this is removed in Java 17 and above.

As I did not really found a well justified answer in google, I was wondering what exactly is the reason for this and how should you circumvent this problem?

For example I am writing a library that serializes and deserializes Java classes and thus *has* to access private fields and constructors to properly serialize them. Even GSON, Spring and other frameworks and libraries I know of show this warning, because they must access private fields and constructors too.

I'm a beginner trying to learn, and am quite frustrated with JShell. I've gone to multiple sources (eBooks, online lessons, etc.). Whenever the instructor gives instructions for more complex methods (e.g. those that involve creating classes), it runs into the same problem:

I input the coding exactly as they tell me to. But JShell only just tells me: Created Class (such-and-such). It never gives the actual output like it's supposed to. 

I thought it was an error on my end, or maybe that I was supposed to input something else, but I've confirmed that's not true. [This link](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_methods.htm) has a simulator that allows you to execute the code. I did this. 

For example, on the ExampleMinNumber example (about a quarter of the way down), I clicked on Live Demo, then clicked on ""Execute.""

 It did the output like it was supposed to, and said:

MinimumValue = 6

Then I copied and pasted it **directly** into my JShell, and all it says is:

created class ExampleMinNumber

&amp;#x200B;

This happens with multiple examples, from different sources. I don't get the problem. Does anyone understand? Thanks for your help.",JShell only says I created a class but never gives output...what is the deal?

One of the major problems I have is that everytime I right click for context menu and choose/hover over something, a lot of windows appear and I can't really see what is going on, I have to close and reopen Maple to fix the bug, but it happens everytime. In the video I show how to recreate it, although the context menu doesn't appear on the video, it is as soon as I hover over something that creates a mess of windows. I've experienced this in other Java-written programs (therefore the reason I'm not reaching Maple's support), but now the bug is affecting my homework, so I've come to the conclusion of finally reaching for help.

5828,2021-08-26 16:55:15,3,1,"Hello everyone. I have decided to share my work experience with a bundle of documentum ecm, c# and ikvmc utility.
Initial task is a batch unloading and changing files from the path list in the XLS file. 
The database administrator gave me Readonly Account, wished me good luck and I began to work.

First of all, I tried to find out what Google would tell me. It showed that working with documentum is done with using DQL queries, which are similar to regular sql. Unfortunately, the attempt to use the first sql query that I came across was unsuccessful.

Then I looked at the database. DBeaver has shown that the most common example tables like `dm_sysobject` or `dm_folder` are missing. We have similar tables with the _s and _r suffixes (`dm_sysobject_s`, `dm_sysobject_r`) instead of them. References to documents were found in the `r_object_id` field of `dm_sysobject_s` table. The remaining information I need was found in other fields of this table. By the way, I really liked the DBeaver searching function by the contents of cells in this program. You can find any table or column name, knowing only the data displayed in the interface if use it. Unfortunately, I couldn't get c# + `ADODB.Connection` to work with cyrillic, so I did everything through the c# + `OracleCommand` combination.

I worked only with desktop programming at that time, so I decided to work through the browser according to the next algorithm:

1. Clearing *%USERPROFILE%\Documentum\Viewed* path, where Documentum puts files when opening;
2. Launching explorer using `ProcessStartInfo`;
3. Using links of the format *http://&lt;server&gt;/webtop/drl/objectId/&lt;dm_sysobject_s.r_object_id&gt;* as `.Arguments` for `ProcessStartInfo`;
4. Waiting until the number of files increased by one in *%USERPROFILE%\Documentum\Viewed*;
5. Closing the downloaded file viewer. (At the same time, the Explorer saved one session so I did not touch it);
6. Repeat.

Now, after a couple of cups of coffee, I received a hundred files that I needed every half a year and forgot about this project.

Recently I had to go back to this project because I needed to download several thousand files in a limited time.
I was already working through webapi, `HttpWebRequest` and post/get requests with another system by that time. Unfortunately, the attempt to use the Documentum links using this way was unsuccessful. Server returned an html page with a js script.

A search took me to [msroth/DCTMDeepExport](https://github.com/msroth/DCTMDeepExport) project but it's in java language. This was not a big problem, but the unloading took only 30% of the code. I had no desire to rewrite the rest of the logic in java (or run both projects in parallel), but further study of the issue showed that the documentum vendor offered only the dfc.jar java library for automation and still have to work with the new language. Fortunately, I came across the IKVM project and the IKVMC utility from it.

This utility allows you to convert jar libraries to .net dll files.
Since this thing turned out to be capricious, I decided to show you the main nuances of working with it using the example of Documenum:

1. It is necessary to install ikvm libraries in our project. The easiest way to do this is using the Nuget package. The version of the ikvmc utility must match the versions of the libraries installed in the ikvm project. it is necessary to take into account that the latest available NuGET ikvm package have 8.1.5717 version, but the latest official version of ikvmc on sourceforge is 7.2.4630.5. it seems I found the 8th ikvmc on the github, but the 7th version was enough for me.
2. You should check that you have the JAVA_HOME variable set. Of course, at least major JAVA version is located on this path and ikvm major versions should be the same. I used 7.0.790.15 jdk.
3. one dfc.jar library is not enough to create a full-fledged .net dll. I needed to combine 5 java libraries:
 
~~~
cd c:\ikvmBin
ikvmc.exe -out:mydoc.dll aspectjrt.jar log4j.jar commons-lang-2.4.jar dfc.jar cryptojFIPS.jar.
~~~

Even so, I got a bunch of build warnings, but the dll is finally working. All these libraries were found in the folder where Documentum was deployed and its are located next to dfc.jar. For any other java project, all required libraries should also be in the project (or java_home?) folder.
Also .net Dll can be compiled from the single dfc.jar. But when you run the application where this library will be linked, you will get errors about the missing java classes. It is impossible to rename the dll obtained after generation, because you will get an error during .net project assembly. 32 bit ikvmc should be used for 32 bit .net projects, 64x is used for 64x projects respectively.  
4. After the conversion my dll stopped seeing the dfc.properties file where the server and the port were set. Experimenting with DFC_PROPERTIES, DFCPROPERTIES and ClassPath environment variables didn't help me. Also according to:[error-java-io-filenotfoundexception-dfc-properties](https://forums.opentext.com/forums/developer/discussion/157324/error-java-io-filenotfoundexception-dfc-properties)  
it is required to specify the path to this file during building the java project. I haven’t found any information how to repeat this for the .net project, but... but I've found the source of the java class: 
[MikaSu/QuickClient/QueryUtils/createSessionManager](https://github.com/MikaSu/QuickClient/blob/89d0230b81de068efab26b9d638525cd23f4d55a/JQuickClient/src/org/quickclient/classes/QueryUtils.java#L255)
and `createSessionManager` method.
Everything should work if you specify the port and server for `client.getClientConfig` as in this example. 

5. Well, after that you just download the file in the same way as in the `GetContent` method from:
[AshokKolwal/DocumentumService/DocumentumApi/GetContent](https://github.com/AshokKolwal/DocumentumService/blob/722820c78fc29faf6dde1167573a16eae3a3d5b2/DocumentumService/Utility/DocumentumApi.cs#L466)","documentum, csharp and ikvmc utility"

Hello r/java !!!, I have made a simple Java Spring microservices project applying the BFF pattern with gRPC. It comes with a UI, also it has the Kotlin Spring and Go versions. I have added all the necessary files for you to start hacking. I hope this setup will help you exploring the BFF pattern, gRPC integration, and maybe most importantly how such setup could be applied in different languages.

5853,2021-09-04 04:26:09,63,1,"Checking for `null` is quite verbose in Java. The current best practice is to either use Nullability annotations or `Optional&lt;T&gt;`. Personally, I'm in the annotations camp. Yes, optional is very useful in streams but I don't like the cognitive and runtime overhead it implies anywhere else.

My dream would be if one day nullability would be added to the type system. Obviously, that's a lot of work. But wouldn't be a pragmatic first step, to reduce just the boilerplate of null checks with a safe call operator? The compiler could surely rewrite this code:

```java
if (getLoggedInUser()?.isPowerUser()) {
}
```

To this:

```java
if (getLoggedInUser() != null &amp;&amp; getLoggedInUser().isPowerUser()) {
}
```

To avoid an unexpected double method invocation, it could assign to ad hoc created temp variables:

```java
User generatedSafeCall1;
if ((generatedSafeCall1 = getLoggedInUser()) != null &amp;&amp; generatedSafeCall1.isPowerUser()) {
}
```

I believe this would end a lot of complaints about `null` handling in Java. Since only new code would use the `?.` operator, backwards compatibility shouldn't be an issue either.",How hard would it be to add a safe call operator to the Java language?

5895,2021-09-15 16:25:55,23,1,"I've been working on a (now) Ktor web service for the past few years for work. It's about 13k LOC and it processes roughly 2-3 billion req/day. At peak, I see it flooded with 60-120k req/sec. I have it hosted on DigitalOcean (which is also causing me a lot of grief on networking issues at this scale), with the main Ktor app hosted across 170-250 auto-scaled 4 vCPU nodes.

My main issue is: I'm running into some serious performance woes. I don't want to be buying 4 vCPU instances, but that's the most that my app will reliably use. If I halve the instance count and double the vCPU per instance, it will just choke badly. Just uses moderately low CPU, and causes extremely high Load Averages. Our web service API latency skyrockets. If I treat it like a Node project and double up app replicas per 8 vCPU node, it does slightly better, but the overhead of two instances just ruins the cost effectiveness.

I'm guessing *some* of the issues are the non-async code behind some APIs. I also have a couple components that use JDBC behind some `withContext(``Dispatchers.IO``) {...}` blocks. Some `java.io.File` I/O is mixed in there, again with the IO dispatcher. We call a LOT of 3rd party REST APIs. Right now, we're using the Java 11 HttpClient in Async mode, but not necessarily tied to that if we benchmark and find that it sucks. We primarily use jasync-postgresql and lettuce for Redis, and those have seemingly worked okay with &lt; 5ms latency at the 99.5% percentile up to 50k QPS.

What I want to know is: Anyone running a large Kotlin web app with a lot of activity, how do you get it to scale properly per CPU core **without spiking the load avg**?

Or more importantly, **how the heck can I run a profiler on a coroutine based app**? I've tried the built-in IntelliJ profiler, as well as JProfiler that claims it can deal with coroutines, and neither really tell me anything useful. I understand that the coroutines are broken apart in the dispatcher's backing thread pools, so it's really difficult to take a trace and reconstruct that into an actual call tree like traditional thread-per-worker models. All the profilers I've tried lump all coroutine calls under the backing thread pool's threads in a randomized fashion, with no obvious hotspots sticking out at all.

At the moment, I have zero visibility into what the heck is taking up CPU, what things are hanging on for data and causing Load Avg to spike without using CPU, and what to work on to improve my scalability. I'm just poking around in the dark, just coding on best practices and experience to get this far, and I'm hitting a brick wall and feeling like I might need to port this whole thing to Rust.

I realize this is kind of a vague post, but any potential direction that someone could point me towards? Thanks for reading.",Performance for my Ktor web service (Profiling?)

This annoyed me so I built this simple tool so I wouldn't have to go to the website just to make a simple repo.  


It requires you create an API token on github and toss that in your environment variables.  There is some documentation in the README.  


I also put together a pretty bloated exe for windows and a linux binary that can be tossed into your bin directory if you want to use it that way (built with pyinstaller).  In addition, I built a craptacular PKGBUILD to get the binary installed with flavors of arch linux.

## Easy to learn

No doubt, PHP is very easy to learn because of the resources available for beginners and its syntax. PHP is very beginner-friendly and provides a very large community which makes it easy, to begin with.

To get started with PHP you need to[ install PHP](https://hackeradda.com/index.php/how-to-install-php-in-windows-linux-or-mac) and also need to have knowledge of HTML, CSS, and MySql for databases. I am going to write the very first “hello world” program in PHP to get started with.

    &lt;?php echo “Hello World”; ?&gt;

**Output**: Hello World

Check out PHP programming books [here](https://github.com/manjunath5496/PHP-Programming-Books)

## Popularity

PHP is very popular for web development and approx 45% of websites are using PHP for their backend. The most popular cms are also written in PHP. It has over 1,415,540 questions on StackOverflow till the date this post was written i.e Sept 23, 2021. [Click here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php) to check

## Development cost

It is a very big task while choosing technologies to start a new project according to the client’s budget. If you have to do a project with a very low budget (under $1k) then we have to choose cost-efficient technology, we can’t use enterprise-level technologies such as JAVA or PYTHON.

## Laravel Framework

It is another big reason which I am thinking keeps PHP alive and in demand. Laravel is a very useful and great framework of PHP and it has a great development team and great mentor Taylor Otwell.

Look at google trends — [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0jwy148,%2Fm%2F0_v2szx,django,ror)

### Github stars on most popular backend web framework

* **Laravel** — 66.6K
* **Django** — 59.8K
* **Express** — 54.5K
* **Ruby on Rails** — 49.1K
* **Easy Hosting availability**

## Easy hosting availability

PHP is very popular so it is very easy to find PHP-based hosting at a very reasonable price. There are tons of hosting providers which support PHP hosting.

**The Top 10 PHP Hosting Providers**

1. Bluehost — best overall PHP hosting provider.
2. HostGator — best for uptime.
3. InMotion — best for secure PHP hosting.
4. A2 Hosting — best for PHP hosting support.
5. SiteGround — best for PHP features.
6. Hostinger — best for affordability.
7. iPage — best for PHP updates.
8. DreamHost — best for storage space.
9. WP Engine — best for scalability.
10. HostPapa — best for online guidance.

## CMS

The content management systems are another very important assets for PHP to keep it alive forever. There are many great CMS such as WordPress written in PHP.

### Top 5 PHP cms framework

1. WordPress
2. Magento
3. Drupal
4. Joomla
5. OpenCart

PHP is also used by many fortune 500 tech startups and corporate giants such as Facebook, Wikipedia, MailChimp, Slack, and Etsy e.t.c.

I have been seeing a lot of post saying that java and Spring are dying and the only reason it is used is because it is too expensive for enterprises to migrate to other technologies.

Lately for about a 1 year i have been included in a java project for orchestrating some sort of complex process that expands to multiple services. At the time of starting this project we decided to go on with Camunda platform in combination with Spring Boot. We created the process and successfully deployed and it is up and running. While learning this platform it was hard to get good and clear documentation on how to do really useful things. I had a hard time reading documentations and user guides were very short. So overall the idea was very nice but definitely documentation lacked and it made it very hard to develop and really not pleasant.

Lately I discovered Flowable and its integration with Spring Boot and it has a great documentation and it shows why it fits so good with spring boot. 

I really like process orchestration across multiple services and have something visual to see by. 

What do you guys think? Are any other platforms that i am missing out? Please suggest any. 

I think flowable should get more attention and be really useful. So if you can spread the word! This may help someone!

Apparently each delegated property needs to be stored in the object itself. I understand why this is required - after all, the construction of the delegation objects can use the owner object and its construction arguments, and it can be useful for things like `lazy`. But it does seem like a waste - in the `by map` case, for example, it can have used the same map object for all properties since it's already stored in the object and since they are distinguished by the `KProperty` passed to the map's `getValue` anyway, not by the identity of the delegation object.

After my first full work week of using Rider, I have mixed (though mostly positive) feelings.


Every turn I take in Rider is generally positive met with arbitrary feeling limitations, mostly enforced by older business decisions that are luckily relatively easy to resolve (though forcing changes for all other devs on my team).


For example, my work has a flow where my devs receive a request, they work on it then submit the code for a code review. In Visual Studio, this is simple enough; finish code and request review. Well, in this mixed instance other devs will request a review, which will show up in the Rider TFVC -- but upon clicking the code review I am brought to the web version of Azure DevOps specifically to the Code Review shelveset (which does allow me to place notes, but not other critical code review actions, like closing and such).


From what I can see, switching to Git might have a built in way to do code reviews (or at the least there will be plugins to help that flow) and honestly I feel like it's time to move to Git anyway; so I will be doing that change over this weekend.


Another random thing that is irking me is losing the ability to right click special paste json/xml as classes. I abused that often in Visual Studio and not having that built in is driving me nuts, as I have to use a random website to handle that translation for me (and no, I don't want to do this by hand -- screw that).


So after testing tuesday (and having issues with code reviews) it was release wednesday so I loaded everything up during the night and got ready to do a web deploy AND.... It doesn't seem to exist, so I had to go back to Visual Studio to do the release. Which is... painful, though I understand, I already have been trying to get the releases through a gated process in Azure DevOps so this just expedites that need.


In short, changing to Git and setting up releases in Azure DevOps should remove MOST of my pain. Though I am still running into issues with one of my projects being unable to run migrations while the rest work fine. 


Next pain point was getting Rider running on my M1 Macbook Air, and this wasn't too hard but I hit a brick wall almost immediately. The integration for the Rider EAP (Needed for M1 macs not to run like hot garbage) for TFVC just straight up wont work, gives a java error on trying to grab source. I assume it's something in the java library not agreeing with some change in the ARM processor. Luckily I think I can work around this by moving to Git.


So-far, this isn't so bad. But the thing is, if this is to work for me I need to get to a place where I can uninstall Visual Studio and feel safe. And I think I'll be able to do that just fine, but I do think I need to change the dev flow (for the better) for the rest of the team.","[Development Diary] Switching to Rider full time for a month, week 1."

6040,2021-10-22 09:29:07,1,1,"I'm trying to configure Gradle to access our nexus artifact repository through Jenkins but I have a problem accessing the variable in our repositories section.

I have the following four vars in my build.gradle:

val nexusSnapshotURL = System.getenv(""nexusSnapshotURL"")  
val nexusReleaseURL = System.getenv(""nexusReleaseURL"")  
val nexusUsername = System.getenv(""nexusUsername"")  
val nexusPassword = System.getenv(""nexusPassword"")

&amp;#x200B;

Which I use in a publishing task and in our repositories section. 

This part publishes to our nexus and works fine with the current setup:

publishing **{**  
 publications **{**  
 create&lt;MavenPublication&gt;(""userdata"") **{**  
 from(*components*\[""java""\])  
 **}**  
   **}**  
 *repositories* **{**  
 maven **{**  
 *isAllowInsecureProtocol* = true  
 *url* = uri(if (*version*.toString().*endsWith*(""SNAPSHOT"")) nexusSnapshotURL else nexusReleaseURL)  
credentials **{**  
 *username* = nexusUsername  
 *password* = nexusPassword  
 **}**  
**}**  
   **}**  
**}**

&amp;#x200B;

but here:

*repositories* **{**  
 mavenCentral()  


  maven **{**  
 *url* = uri(nexusReleaseURL)  
credentials **{**  
 *username* = nexusUsername  
 *password* = nexusPassword  
 **}**  
   **}**  
**}**

&amp;#x200B;

the nexusReleaseURL is null.

&amp;#x200B;

This is how I pass the vars in Jenkins:

stage('deploy nexus') {  


   steps {  
sh '''  
nexusReleaseUrl=URL1  
nexusSnapshotUrl=URL2  
nexusUsername=name  
nexusPassword=pass  
./gradlew publish  
   '''  
}  
}

So how can I pass it as a variable accessible at the time for the repositories section? An elvis operator with the URL isn't a solution",Access env variables from Gradle

I'm writing a project helper plugin for my Kotlin projects, that would config the projects (Kotlin version, JVM targets, Kotlin compile targets, add common deps for testing etc).

This handler implementation with non-generic `TResult` works:

but when I use another generic there:

    class GetUsersHandler() : QueryHandler&lt;GetUsers, List&lt;UserDto&gt;&gt; { ... }

Spring cannot find my handler bean.

My findings: `ResolvableType.forClassWithGenerics()` produces `ResolvableType` `QueryHandler&lt;GetUsers, List&lt;?&gt;&gt;`, so when Spring iterates through all beans and checks the one I am looking for, `ResolvableType::isAssignableFrom` matches `QueryHandler`, then `GetUsers`, then `List` and fails on matching `?` with `UserDto` \- [this](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/main/spring-core/src/main/java/org/springframework/core/ResolvableType.java#L303) condition returns false

I don’t know if I am doing something wrong or if there is some problem (either bug or language limitation?)

So, don’t you by any chance know if this is this somehow possible?

Thank you!",Spring cannot find bean by nested generic interface type

I make this post because there seems to be no documented solution to this problem if the issue is in the module-info.java. It might seem obvious to most people here but to me it really wasn't.

I had the libraries set as dependencies in my maven pom.xml and I checked the external libraries. The thing I wanted to use (ObjectMapper) was literally there and my intellij didn't see it. The *requires* tag was what fixed it for me.

Solutions I found to this problem included reimporting the maven project, deleting intellij cache and restarting the IDE or maven commands to reload the dependencies. None of those actions help if the lib isn't set as required.

6103,2021-11-06 16:41:54,2,1,"Hi, I am as many other used to using python for whenever I need to do small ad hoc jobs where I need to write some scripts for something.

But recently I have gotten more and more into kotlin, I really like how flexible it is. So I would like to make a change from using more python to kotlin. But I didnt really wanna use intellij, since my punty computer takes wayy to slow to start it up, and lags constantly with it. Ofr that reason I would like to go with vs code.

I then tried following [this](https://eyeofmidas.wordpress.com/2021/02/26/kotlin-gradle-and-vs-code-on-ubuntu-20-04/) guide for running a gradle project.

it's basically done by running:

    gradle init

and  then going thorugh some configurations. 

I then an able to run ""gradle build"" and gradle run""  and it can run an hello world quite well.

&amp;#x200B;

But lets now say hat I want to md5-hash something, this means that I need to have a reference to ""import java.security.MessageDigest"".

&amp;#x200B;

I have the following build.gradle.kts file:

&amp;#x200B;

    plugins {

 id(""org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm"") version ""1.5.0""

 // Apply the application plugin to add support for building a CLI application in Java.
    application
}

repositories {
 // Use Maven Central for resolving dependencies.
 mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {

 implementation(platform(""org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-bom""))


 implementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8"")

 implementation(""com.google.guava:guava:30.1.1-jre"")


 testImplementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test"")


 testImplementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test-junit"")
}

application {

    mainClass.set(""com.Eyes.Midas.AppKt"")
}



And I guess I have to add the dependnecy somewhere here, but I can really not figure out how!

&amp;#x200B;

I try googling high and low for queries like ""gradle [java.security](https://java.security)"" ""gradle [java.security](https://java.security) dependency"" but nothing shows up. I also can't find a url for that library, in case I needed to refeerence it through the web

 I also have no idea whether the security lib is somehow included in the standard jvm package, or if I need to install it somehow.

What is mostly surprising me, is mostly that it's so hard to find info info about doing this. For another language such as python, if I google ""python install flask"", I can find a myriad of guides detailing exactly how to include packages.

&amp;#x200B;

So firstly it would be really cool if someone could give me some tips for how I add a dependency. But maybe more so, what is the general method that one would normally go through when trying to add a dependency? other than trying to google how to do it and hope that someone somewhere has done the same thing before and can show it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not looking for the holy grail, there is no A better than B etc but through those debates we update the advantages that introduced lately. 

So, now with the arrival of .net 6 that shows where MS is heading, what are your thoughts? Does java ecosystem steal compete today .net ? If you were choosing a static language, high performance and great time to market for your startup , what would you pick? (mostly from those two techs).

Many times, things are blur. You hear of xamarin, blazor, net core and you think one language to rule them all, just to find out that xamarin is awful and blazor clunky etc. On the other hand, you see many java jobs but if you compare java/spring with c#/.net i'm not sure you have more jobs. One way to compare is to see how many greenfields backend projects start with java(spring quarkus etc.) and how many with .net which is hard to find such information.

So, would you choose java or .net for back? why? (i know its a java thread, but i have experience in c# and in .net reddit threads, they say how superior is c# .net ecosystem and that java is stuck in 8 with mess license and low evolution eg linq etc. how great is Visual studio, now hot  reload etc. but i'd love to hear some real benefits of java - intellij compare to VS working on \*nix vs windows etc.)",Java ecosystem vs .Net 6

6119,2021-11-11 06:53:18,35,1,"Java can be used on any computer, atleast, pretty much. a windows 7 computer trying to download windows 10 won't go well. a windows 7 computer downloading a java OS would go better as java is probably just as lightweight.

I don't mean any old linux based system either. i mean a system that is like full on. straight up it's own thing. a good reason is that java play's well enough with other languages that installing other programs shouldnt be much of a problem. and java can work with languages like c and c# in system code as well for stuff that just cant be coded in java. Java is an easier to fix language too so if an update needs made urgently, nothing will go too downhill like it could if c++ code went at say, apple, for macos. also the fact that java can be installed on a mac fine and run, but can windows or something? no. java can make way for other brand computers than main such as a mac to get an os that works fine with windows, and is something new incase they want to modify the computer in a better way that will run fine unlike windows would. (I do, infact, have a windows computer myself) 

personally i see the only issue being internet like both intake and output cause, java doesn't handle it well on it's own sometimes and might break, but like i said c and c++ are usable with java in coding.",A statement on why Java operating systems should be a normal thing in 2021/2022

I work with java development mostly back-end REST APIs and i always try to get the best performance out of my code. I try to use best practices and put best possible solutions for performance.

All this got me thinking that there is probably somehow a way i can customise the JVM around my application needs and push this even further. I know the fundamentals of the G.C. but not much else. 

Has anyone done this in a production environment? Like they changed their JVM settings in order to get some kind of leverage? Is this the same for all different types of JDKs? Is this at all advisable?

If you look carefully I had to put print statements in the code to visualize what exactly was going on. Now what if instead of print statements we were able to generate the code to update a UI for visualizing, say

* Every mutation to variables
* Every if condition
* Every iteration of loops(it's a variable mutation in a way as 'i' would be incremented)

Feel free to add more such cases and criticisms for existing cases. Current algorithm visualizing tools don't necessarily support visualizing code which are not standard algorithms. It would be helpful if we were able to visualize such algorithms. javac can be used as a library as it provides us the ability to get the AbstractSyntaxTree which could be used to analyze a given piece of code and generate the code for visualizing them.

So I want to create a list of objects property, but I first need to do operations before initializing it.

        private val Courses = courses
        private var events: MutableList&lt;Event&gt; = mutableListOf&lt;Event&gt;()

                }
            }
        }
        val Events = events
        ...
    }

What I'm doing is creating a `private var EventList` and adding a list of `Event` object to it in the init section. And then I'm creating the `val Events` property, which I can access outside of the class as readonly.

Is there a better way?

6152,2021-11-20 12:19:51,24,1,"I am not same guy as the guy that took heat for use of global keyword with variables like 2 weeks ago or so.

But that topic got me thinking and wondering and i am more of a begginer thats why i am asking.

The argument was that using global is less safe and problem with unit testing!

What if i am the only user using this script? meaning there wont be any unit testing....

Ok i get it is still bad practice and its a valid point, but arent all variables in python more or less publicly available since in python you do not have  like in java or C# private, final, constant etc. keywords?

Suggestion was to use singleton. 

Now i looked it up and from what i understand, singleton is a kind of class that you can instanciate only once. Meaning you can have only 1 class of that singleton which is usefull if you want to share data between diffrent classes where you would just make them use same singleton. Am i understanding it correctly ?

So if i am not using multiple classes or if i am not using a class at all:

For instance i like doing tkinter gui applications where you will run into problem if you want to have multiple variables when you click a button for instance. Now  one of suggestions on stack was to use   get()methods inside of  lambda function call or inside the function. 

But still if i use global, but now just inside the get function(ok i guess it would be better to a degree), but is not that still as bad?

So thinking about singleton i could just make a normal class since i dont need it to be same for multiple classes. But i can not see a point of how would that be safer or better?

If I can not make python variables private and then use set/get methods like in some languages.

Or is simple making a class and then doing class1.variable a better way of handling variables?

Is accessing class variables directly outside of class equally bad??

Which brings me to last questions:

\- what about when your writing a class and you use inside function, inside class ""self.variable"" which has same function as global is that equally bad?? Or am i overthinking this since i pass self already in function call??

What am i missing ?",About use of global

Casbin is a powerful and efficient open-source access control library for Python projects. It provides support for enforcing authorization based on various [access control models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security_model).

## Supported models

1. [**ACL (Access Control List)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list)
2. **ACL with [superuser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser)**
3. **ACL without users**: especially useful for systems that don't have authentication or user log-ins.
3. **ACL without resources**: some scenarios may target for a type of resources instead of an individual resource by using permissions like ``write-article``, ``read-log``. It doesn't control the access to a specific article or log.
4. **[RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)**
5. **RBAC with resource roles**: both users and resources can have roles (or groups) at the same time.
6. **RBAC with domains/tenants**: users can have different role sets for different domains/tenants.
7. **[ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-Based_Access_Control)**: syntax sugar like ``resource.Owner`` can be used to get the attribute for a resource.
8. **[RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)**: supports paths like ``/res/*``, ``/res/:id`` and HTTP methods like ``GET``, ``POST``, ``PUT``, ``DELETE``.
9. **Deny-override**: both allow and deny authorizations are supported, deny overrides the allow.
10. **Priority**: the policy rules can be prioritized like firewall rules.

## How it works?

In Casbin, an access control model is abstracted into a CONF file based on the **PERM metamodel (Policy, Effect, Request, Matchers)**. So switching or upgrading the authorization mechanism for a project is just as simple as modifying a configuration. You can customize your own access control model by combining the available models. For example, you can get RBAC roles and ABAC attributes together inside one model and share one set of policy rules.

The most basic and simplest model in Casbin is ACL. ACL's model CONF is:

```ini
# Request definition
[request_definition]
r = sub, obj, act

# Policy definition
[policy_definition]
p = sub, obj, act

# Policy effect
[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

# Matchers
[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act

```

An example policy for ACL model is like:

```
p, alice, data1, read
p, bob, data2, write
```

It means:

- alice can read data1
- bob can write data2

We also support multi-line mode by appending '\\'  in the end:  

```ini
# Matchers
[matchers]
m = r.sub == p.sub &amp;&amp; r.obj == p.obj \ 
  &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act
```

Further more, if you are using ABAC,  you can try operator `in` like following in Casbin **golang** edition (jCasbin and Node-Casbin are not supported yet):

```ini
# Matchers
[matchers]
m = r.obj == p.obj &amp;&amp; r.act == p.act || r.obj in ('data2', 'data3')
```

But you **SHOULD** make sure that the length of the array is **MORE** than **1**, otherwise there will cause it to panic.

For more operators, you may take a look at [govaluate](https://github.com/Knetic/govaluate)

## Features

What Casbin does:

1. enforce the policy in the classic ``{subject, object, action}`` form or a customized form as you defined, both allow and deny authorizations are supported.
2. handle the storage of the access control model and its policy.
3. manage the role-user mappings and role-role mappings (aka role hierarchy in RBAC).
4. support built-in superuser like ``root`` or ``administrator``. A superuser can do anything without explict permissions.
5. multiple built-in operators to support the rule matching. For example, ``keyMatch`` can map a resource key ``/foo/bar`` to the pattern ``/foo*``.

What Casbin does NOT do:

1. authentication (aka verify ``username`` and ``password`` when a user logs in)
2. manage the list of users or roles. I believe it's more convenient for the project itself to manage these entities. Users usually have their passwords, and Casbin is not designed as a password container. However, Casbin stores the user-role mapping for the RBAC scenario.

```
pip install casbin
```

## Documentation

https://casbin.org/docs/en/overview

## Online editor

You can also use the online editor (http://casbin.org/editor/) to write your Casbin model and policy in your web browser. It provides functionality such as ``syntax highlighting`` and ``code completion``, just like an IDE for a programming language.

## Tutorials

https://casbin.org/docs/en/tutorials

## Get started

1. New a Casbin enforcer with a model file and a policy file:

```python
import casbin
e = casbin.Enforcer(""path/to/model.conf"", ""path/to/policy.csv"")
```

Note: you can also initialize an enforcer with policy in DB instead of file, see [Persistence](#persistence) section for details.

2. Add an enforcement hook into your code right before the access happens:

```python
sub = ""alice""  # the user that wants to access a resource.
obj = ""data1""  # the resource that is going to be accessed.
act = ""read""  # the operation that the user performs on the resource.

if e.enforce(sub, obj, act):
    # permit alice to read data1
    pass
else:
    # deny the request, show an error
    pass
```

3. Besides the static policy file, Casbin also provides API for permission management at run-time. For example, You can get all the roles assigned to a user as below:

```python
roles = e.get_roles_for_user(""alice"")
```

See [Policy management APIs](#policy-management) for more usage.

4. Please refer to the ``tests`` files for more usage.

## Policy management

Casbin provides two sets of APIs to manage permissions:

- [Management API](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/management_api.go): the primitive API that provides full support for Casbin policy management. See [here](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/management_api_test.go) for examples.
- [RBAC API](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/rbac_api.go): a more friendly API for RBAC. This API is a subset of Management API. The RBAC users could use this API to simplify the code. See [here](https://github.com/casbin/casbin/blob/master/rbac_api_test.go) for examples.

We also provide a web-based UI for model management and policy management:

I wanted to give Kotlin a try, but I've managed to fall right at the first hurdle.

I'm on an M1 MacBook Air, already have an AdoptOpenJDK build installed on my machine; I installed IDEA Community ARM, and tried to create a basic Console-based Kotlin app.

The problem is I'm getting the following, before I can even build the project:

    Could not open init generic class cache for initialization script '/private/var/folders/6b/7w6rz6ds5qs7wmgcqfx8f_vm0000gn/T/wrapper_init.gradle' (/Users/username/.gradle/caches/7.1/scripts/6ujkq23meo4yp2bhjzzoqajq2).
    &gt; BUG! exception in phase 'semantic analysis' in source unit '_BuildScript_' Unsupported class file major version 61
    
    * Try:
    Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output. Run with --scan to get full insights.

Running it with`--stacktrace` isn't too helpful either; it spit out a bunch of lines which mean nothing to me. One that sticks out is `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported class file major version 61`.

Some googling led me to switching to different JDKs, but I've tried 3 to no avail.

I tried doing the same with a basic Java 'hello world' program, which runs fine, so I'm really confused.

Does anyone happen to have any idea what's going on here?

Sorry if this is a silly question, I'm just not having much look trying to resolve it unfortunately.

I recently got asked by my boss to take over as technical lead on a project as the previous tech lead is leaving and they're not happy with how the project has been handled so far (no clear git branching strategy, master is way behind develop, tons of technical debt, etc.)

So at my previous company, we had these unit tests for our java application in maven which enforced a styleguide, checked some logical requirements in our custom framework, etc.

What are some useful/standard tests I can add to a jenkins build for our Django application to ensure nothing goes wrong before deployment? I want to add a styleguide checker/Linter which will use probably a subset of pep8 (there are parts I like, parts I dislike, parts I have no opinion on).

Additionally, what are some other good quality assurance tools I can use in conjunction with Jenkins/python? This application is currently in a pretty sorry state and has a lot of work to be done to get it to a clean point

Task:

In the Warmest Week you can support countless charities.  In order to monitor who donates how much for what purpose, the organization has asked us to develop a program in Java for this.
 Specifically, you need to create a Charity class containing

 - the name of the organization,
- a short description of the charity they want to raise money for,
 - how much money they want to raise. Ex.: Red Cross Alden Biesen who want to buy a new manikin for mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
 - In addition, you should make a class of someone who makes a donation.  You have to decide for yourself which data you need to keep in this class.


 You must be able to add the gifts to the Charity class.

 Develop a Java program (in BlueJ) containing the classes listed above.

 Implement at least methods to calculate the following:

 The total amount raised for the charity.
 Whether the charity has raised its wish amount
 The biggest gift for charity

I am a java developer since quite some time, but since oracle did its license thing change i am very confused about the different JDK and JRE implementations.

Not only are there many implementations but they are also frequently renamed (due to law suites afaik).

So this openend a few questions for me.

### OpenJ9
OpenJ9 seems to be a implementation of the **JRE** by eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/) but the new images for docker are released under the name of ibm and semeru (https://hub.docker.com/_/ibm-semeru-runtimes?tab=tags&amp;page=1&amp;name=17) and i can't really make sense of this.

### Adoptium &amp; OpenJDK &amp; AdoptOpenJdk &amp; Eclipse Temurium
As far as i know *Adoptium &amp; OpenJDK &amp; AdoptOpenJdk* is basically all the same and a project to release existing implementations (like OpenJ9). So basically a platform to download binaries. The most recent name is Adoptium, but the features are not the same on all webpages, while i can download openj9 JRE on AdoptOpenJdk i can't do so on Adoptium.&lt;br&gt;
Also why is the docker/openjdk repo not deprecated since it now should be called adoptium? https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk &lt;br&gt;
**Eclipse Temurium** on the other hand goes only by one name, and seems to be the software that *Adoptium* uses to build &amp; test JREs and JDKs

While to me all of this is a little confusing i have specific questions:

* What *JDK* and *JRE* implementations are there and whats their respective newest name.
* Where do i get them, is there a central place (like AdoptOpenJdk was) or do i need to get them from the specific maintainers (ibm, eclipse, openjdk)
* Same goes for docker images, whats the currently ""expected"" ways to get JDK and JRE images?

There are a zillion dependent function options (thenAccept, thenRun, thenCombine, thenCompose, whenComplete, etc) so it's hard to be sure that you've chosen the correct one.

If you want to dig beneath the surface into the implementation (CompletableFuture, ForkJoinPool, etc) you'd better have a drink first.

If you're on a small server (just a few cores) the common fork/join pool will decide to kick off new threads for every teeny task, instead of using a proper thread pool. Java Flight Recorder *loves* all the extra (mostly useless) thread metadata.

Of course you don't have to use the common fork/join pool --  unless you're using it indirectly, e.g. via the JDK HttpClient, in which case you might need to go configure one or two system properties on the command line to adjust the (global) behavior of the common pool.

I would be able to understand the first few days of teaching but as we continue through the course I notice it would become drastically difficult to code. I managed to pass those classes with an ""A"" but I still would feel clueless about certain things about coding. Then I thought it would be a better idea to teach myself. I ended up coding in unity-making games which were fun but I would lose interest too quickly even for the smaller games, but I managed to pick up C# much quicker because of the past knowledge I had with Java and C++. Now I want to give it another shot. This time I want to create an app that tells the users their potential profit and loss in option trading, there wasn't any that grabbed my attention on the play store or app store.  I am currently taking the android studios course and I am able to learn at my own pace. I am going to make a habit of coding for 1 hour on weekdays and 2-4 on weekends. 

I want to join this community because I really want to be a part of an environment that has the same interests as mine. Before I tried to solo all my other projects and it got lonely and boring, none of my other friends share the same interests as mine, they prefer to play games with me instead of helping make some. Here I hope to grow my skills as a coder and build my first successful project!

It's absolutely perfect until you need to investigate problems in your code.

One of the common problems with coroutines is the shortened stack trace in exceptions thrown in coroutines. For example, this code prints out the stack trace below:

    import kotlinx.coroutines.delay
    import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking
    
    suspend fun fun1() {
        delay(100)
        throw Exception(""exception at ${System.currentTimeMillis()}"")
    }
    
    suspend fun fun2() {
        fun1()
        delay(100)
    }
    
    suspend fun fun3() {
        fun2()
        delay(100)
    }
    
    fun main() {
        try {
            runBlocking {
                fun3()
            }
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            e.printStackTrace()
        }
    }

The stack trace doesn't represent the true coroutine call stack when the exception was created: calls of functions `fun3` and `fun2` are absent. On complex systems, this problem can make debugging much more difficult.

The Kotlin team are known about the problem and has come up with a [solution](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/docs/topics/debugging.md#stacktrace-recovery), but it solves just a part of the cases.

The reason why the stack trace is shortened is that when the coroutine wakes up, only the last method of its call stack is called.

Therefore, after studying the implementation of coroutines, I wrote my own solution based on bytecode generation and MethodHandle API. I called it [Stacktrace-decoroutinator](https://github.com/Anamorphosee/stacktrace-decoroutinator). My library replaces the coroutine awakening implementation. It generates classes at runtime with names that match the entire coroutine call stack. These classes don't do anything except call each other in the coroutine call stack order. Thus, if the coroutine throws an exception, they mimic the real call stack of the coroutine during the creation of the exception stacktrace.

In the near future I am going to test the library in my production environment and I will be glad if someone else will join me.",Kotlin coroutines stack trace issue
6301,2022-01-06 01:46:59,0,1,"The mere presence of a `modular-info.java` file in a maven project (not talking about multi-module maven projects here) throws the test lifecycle into a tizzy. I've spent a good part of the day researching this, and none of the workarounds seem satisfactory (one ought not to hard code absolute paths in a pom file, for eg).

The tests fail because of permission issues (reflection and such) in modular java.

Which brings me to a larger question.. I don't imagine many wanted modules for this kind of *permission* management; we wanted modules so our apps could be lighter weight / smaller footprint.

It's a great introduction to Java, but as the banner at the top of the page points out, hasn't been updated past Java 8. This means readers aren't introduced to new features like local variable type inference or switch expressions, although they could greatly benefit from both.

There's [Java Language Changes](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/language/java-language-changes.html); while the articles are well written, you have to do the diff since Java 8 yourself, e.g. read about swich expressions (and make sure to pick the non-preview version), then continue with pattern matching for switch once it's out of preview. Don't get me wrong, these docs are great when you're already a Java developer, but from the perspective of a beginner, the material is all over the place. In case of switch (pun intended), I'd argue they should be taught expressions first, since they don't have confusing fall through semantics.

Finally, there's the module system. Lack of documentation is probably one of the many reasons why JPMS sees little adoption. The [JDK 17 documentation landing page](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/) links to the OpenJDK page [Project Jigsaw](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/), showing a lot of different video tutorials and a short quick start guide. ""What's Jigsaw? What's a JEP?"" the confused learner may ask. ""Which documentation should I read?"" Probably the most comprehensive resource on that page is [The State of the Module System](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/spec/sotms/). However, there's the caveat again: ""This document is slightly out of date"", and ""An update is in preparation and will be posted here when ready"". The article has been published in 2016.

I know there's a lot of third party resources to learn Java – websites, books, videos – but they're not written by the people who design the language (at least most of the time). Plus it's difficult to spot outdated material. The JDK javadocs are of exceptionally high quality and constantly being updated. I think the docs explaining the syntax and semantics of the language and runtime  should be held to the same standard. The situation will only get worse with big features like Valhalla and Loom.

So, **tl;dr**: Are there any plans by Oracle or the OpenJDK maintainers to update the tutorial? Ideally it would be version controlled so you could pick the Java version you're working with, and it shows you the state of the language at that point in time. I understand it's low priority. Maybe the community could help creating it?","Are there any plans to create an official, comprehensive introductory documentation for Java 9+?"

Now that the official Version of JLink and JPackage had their official ""LTS"" Release with Java 17, I am curios if Gradle will ever add official Support for these tools.

6333,2022-01-13 18:36:46,0,1,"So, as many know, the JavaScript sort behavior can have some unusual behavior for the uninitiated as it converts all elements to strings before performing it's comparison:

&gt;If compareFunction is not supplied, all non-undefined array elements are sorted by converting them to strings and comparing strings in UTF-16 code units order. For example, ""banana"" comes before ""cherry"". In a numeric sort, 9 comes before 80, but because numbers are converted to strings, ""80"" comes before ""9"" in the Unicode order. All undefined elements are sorted to the end of the array. (*From the Mozilla Docs*)

The reason given for this is normally some version of the fact that JavaScript does not enforce type declarations for variables and/or JavaScript allows mixed type arrays:

&gt;The javaScript sort function is “weird” because javaScript is loosely typed and the function has to be able to sort arrays holding any type of data. If you have a strongly typed language, then you know the type of data in an array, so you can customize a sort function to handle that type of data. You don’t need to pass any arguments to the sorter because you know the kinds of elements you have and can sort them accordingly. But in javaScript, the array could be holding anything so you have to pass in a function that knows how to handle what might be in the array. *(From a Quora Post answering someone confused on Sort behavior*)

However, Python is the same in that it also has mixed type arrays and doesn't enforce variable declarations, but it sorts arrays of numbers numerically, arrays of strings lexicographically, and arrays of arrays position-wise by type, without the need for a compareFunction. Moreover, you can duplicate the same behavior as JavaScript for strings and numbers using a 20 character key function (in the rare case that this is what you want).

So, I'm guessing that the actual reason that the JavaScript sort function works the way it does is different from as described.

Does anyone that knows anything about JavaScript engine internals or standards have an idea? Does it have something to do with performance (like maybe you don't want to do a check at the start to see the type of the first element of the array)?

Or, does it potentially have something to do with backwards compatibility?",[AskJS] Why does the Sort method function the way it does?

6337,2022-01-14 00:10:49,0,1,"I'm an independent armchair software developer. My day job is 40-100 hours a week and is not a developer job. In my spare time over the last 15 years, i've made a few websites and some apps for android, windows desktop, and windows phone. This is mostly personal tools to make my life easier, or social stuff like discord bots and simple scripts to help the communities of the specific games that i play, but i have a few apps in phone app stores and a few projects on github. So basically, i'm not a professional. I have an idea, and i self-learn exactly what i need to know to make it happen.  
  
I always assume i'll succeed, because i know it's just a matter of learning the right thing, but my experience is limited, so i don't immediately know which is the best direction to go for a certain project. When i think up an idea or i'm asked to do something that isn't similar to something i've done before, i'm totally lost until i do a bunch of research to figure out how to get started. I've worked with C#, python, nodejs, php, html, C++, java, but after everything i've done, i've decided that i always want to use C# if possible, and that's what brings me here today.  
  
People at work know that i'm a geek, because i'm the one that solves basically every technological problem that comes up. One time, someone saw a command prompt open on my screen, and they told everyone that i'm a hacker, and now i get random requests for quality of life tools. Someone needed to do lots of point load calculations (structural engineering stuff), and it takes a few minutes with a calculator for each one, so they asked me if i could make it easier. They showed me their math and i made them a simple php form on our web server where they can put in their numbers and it spits out the answer with one click. Someone else wanted to be able to find a position that's centered x feet away from a flat surface. Well i know that's literally the pythagorean theorem and nothing more, so i made another php form and they use it all the time.  
  
But now someone has asked me to make something that's a lot more complicated, and i shudder at the thought of doing this in php/python/nodejs. I need to show a 3d model (possibly just in 2d), let users select specific locations on structural members in that model, and use known load limits to determine if the point loads are safe.  
Based on my past experiences, this is something that i would have no problem pulling off in Unity or Winforms/WPF. But they want to do it on their phones, which are both Android and iphone, which presents some problems. Winforms is windows desktop, and it would have to be webgl if i do it in Unity, because i can't build for IOS without a mac. But apparently webgl is horrible on IOS, so i think that's not the answer.  
  
I've sort of half followed this sub for a long time, so i've seen things mentioned like IIS, Blazor, Core, MVC, ASP, webforms, and whatever else. I have no real understanding of what these things are, aside from being related to using .NET on the web, but i'm hoping that something in the sea of .NET tools is the perfect solution for me to write websites in C#.  
  
One other possible complication is that a windows server just isn't going to happen. We currently have shared unix hosting, and i've been lobbying for a move to a linux vps. If this happens, it will be my job to make it happen, and i would buy an ubuntu vps from OVH.  
  
So to sum up, i want to make a website with C#, ideally with visual UI design, and host it on ubuntu. Can i do this? If so, how? What tools can i use, and what will i need to run on the server? Can i use nginx to serve the site? Can i use postgres? Will the site play nice with IOS? I'm not concerned with using only the most efficient and popular methods, i'm just looking to get the job done. This is going to be used by maybe a dozen people , and probably never more than 2 at the same time, so i'm hoping to hear some suggestions to help me get started with that in mind.

There are many rankings of ""most popular"" Java libraries. But some libraries might have a low surface area; you call into them just a few times and they do a lot of work -- or perhaps *they* mostly call *you*.

Whereas others have many more classes and methods and things that you need to learn about and call directly.

For example, if you use both JUnit and AssertJ, you probably have more and richer code interactions with the latter, right?

It would be super helpful for my current work to know which libraries seem like the ""big ones"" today in this particular sense.

* You can answer for your own project, company, or even your impression of the industry at large -- I'm just gathering names at this point.
* Popularity and growth both matter, so perhaps think in terms of *predicted* popularity in 2 years?
* If it helps, imagine someone wanting to review the state of javadoc quality out there in the world; which libraries would they most want to review? (That's just a hopefully-clarifying example, not my literal current project.)
* EXEMPT: JDK, Android, Spring - I already assume there's a wealth of stuff under these and I have an organizational point of contact. OTOH Apache seems like a looser assortment so I am interested in those.

I am not new to Java but new to such a big project. I am an Android and iOS developer normally so I know what gradle is. But in my Android Java projects there would be only 2 build.gradle files

In my companies application there are over 500. 

The biggest problem is that their build.gradle's all have the deprecated „compile“ keyword in front of all dependencies which got removed in 7.x
They also use groovy which i never saw before but it seems to edit the gradle files while compiling

I wrote a small java program that gets all dependencies and replaces „compile“ with „implementation“

I thought that would work but sadly it just generates errors. Many packages wont be found so i decided i will change the „implementation“ for these dependencies back to „compile“ to see which can stay implementation and which need a new approach.

I also needed to add a lot of other dependencies to several gradle files that couldnt be found whe compiling. I think they were childs of other dependencies but couldnt be found when using the combination of compile and implementatikn

I know that there is the api keyword as well but that needs a change of the plugin from „java“ to „java-library“ which will unfortunately generates an error that i couldnt fix yet
There is a „Classgenerator“ that generates new classes while compiling and itwont work with java library


I am bit lost, my boss is very nice but he has not so much time for me and we are in home office so the communication is harder

I saw the official gradle upgrade guides but they dont help me much.

I barely understand the api vs implementation difference but on Stackoverflow i found this:


„Gradle compile keyword was deprecated in favor of the api and implementation keywords to configure dependencies.

Using api is the equivalent of using the deprecated compile, so if you replace all compile with api everything will works as always.“

6371,2022-01-22 06:23:53,0,1,"**Background:** I've been using SQL Server as my main database for an ERP system for many years(supports just over 100 users). Due to the limitations of the ERP system(bad architecture, legacy application), I get the opportunity to rewrite and architect a new ERP system. (Many of the systems and tables will be redesigned and more thought will be put into it). I've done some small projects using MongoDB and they have been successful. I've read countless post on that using MongoDB over a relational database is just dumb. Below I will explain why that might be the case.

**Why I'm considering using MongoDB (Pros):**

1. Faster development time. The time it takes to normalize the many tables needed, writing all the stored procedures for each query, etc in a relational database is just painful at times even though I've been writing sql for years.
2. Due to the nature of working for manufacturing shop that produces a lot of custom products, most of the time I'm usually grabbing a complex data object with many components.
3. For Bills of Materials, there are multiple times where its required that we save the current state of the object on how it originally calculated everything. An example: you have an excel template that you create an instance from. Overtime that template changes, but you don't want the original instance to be touched. Document type storage is an advantage
4. Similar to point #2 that since its document base object, you get the full object. I see this as a big benefit for generating reports, business intel, machine learning etc. 
5. To many this might be scary, but the ability for the schema to change. As mentioned before, this is a custom shop and keep innovating. The ability to easily add new fields or objects is a plus.
6. This isn't a good point as I don't have experience with scaling, but supposedly it scales better when done properly.

**Why not to use MongoDB (according to what Ive read)**

1. *Lots of data duplication and inconsistent data.* I can see this perhaps being a problem, but most of the time when it comes to Materials, Hardware, etc; these don't change(or shouldn't change). I can see that I will have to on a few occasions to loop through and fix the data if needed. But most of the time if you are referencing, you shouldn't store the exact same object as the object you are suppose to reference. Just store the object ID, and maybe 1-2 fields that you know won't change very often.
2. *The lack of schema (even though you can enforce schemas in MongoDB if you need to which I know I will end up using in some collections.) What this does is force your database to be tightly coupled with your application and not allow other applications to use that database.* I see 2 things that are wrong with this argument in my scenario. 1st is that I want to force anyone who wants access to the data to go through the API, makes more sense to me instead of giving direct access to the database. 2nd is due to the state of Dot Net, having a shared Data Access Library(SDK) would be more than enough to make any kind of application these days. Sure you can't use python, JavaScript, java, etc. Maybe I'm just bias but Dot Net literally can build anything now, we are a Dot Net Shop. 
3. *JOIN statements.* *Every join is another call which effects performance.* My argument to this is that if you are having to make multiple JOIN calls to Mongo, then you didn't design your database well. You have to switch your experience with relational databases to NoSQL databases which focuses more on ""Embedding"" and some ""Referencing"". 
4. *Filtering.* Most of your filtering will have to be done in the application sadly if you require a lot of filtering. This is one I don't see any way around it.
5. *For Dot Net developers, we have Entity Framework Core which speeds up development time.* I think its fair to say that I haven't given entity core much of a fair shot(I've used stored procedures with Dapper). It just feels overwhelming at times and it can be as fast as dapper, but only if you become an expert on it. So the time I would save with Entity Framework I would end up learning how to use it properly(maybe I'm overreacting)

(Note: There isn't a rule where you can't use both types of databases as well)

For those who are experienced in both Relational Databases and NoSQL, could you shed some light on why this might be a bad idea to go full MongoDB? What am I missing? Could you tell me **why you love** MongoDB(NoSQL) or **why you hate it?**",Considering MongoDB for a Production ERP System with Net 6
