@abreslav  - it was great listening to the podcast interview you had (http://talkingkotlin.com/a-chat-with-andrey-breslav/) and I have few follow-up questions:

1. From the original discussion you had at Jetbrains - how similar is the language to the issues you discussed back then. What main principals remains and what was left out of Kotlin?

2. If you start Kotlin now from scratch, are there any significant changes you think you would have done?

3. How do you feel about the adoption level among developers? Is it above or below expectations? What do you think can push Kotlin to be among the leading languages like what happened to go in 2016 (at least according to Tiobe index)

4. Do you see any downsides -feature wise - of having the language targets multi-platforms: js, native etc'

5. What do you think about claims that Kotlin has too many konstraints ;-) - like uncle bob posted recently.

6. Where do you see Kotlin in 5 years from now?

5,2017-01-29 15:53:46,7,8,"A couple months ago I decided to jump into kotlin while speeding up some clojure code. Tired of using java from clojure, I rewrote some of the critical bits in kotlin. An afternoon later, I was so impressed with the experience that I kept writing kotlin. It felt like a production-ready swift.

Interested in trying kotlin for a small web service I was building, I started working on a web framework:

## kog: https://github.com/danneu/kog

^ lots of examples in that readme aka my append-only dumping ground!

Inspired by clojure, I wrapped jetty with a simple `Request -&gt; Response` abstraction and have been stubbing out machinery on top of it ever since, informed by the web service I've been building alongside it.

Two months later it has a decent feature surface area from json encode/decode combinators to a type-safe router to accept-header negotiation, though riddled with `// TODO:`'s and stopping points that came too soon.

There are definitely peculiarities in the code, some from my limited amount of time, some from me being inexperienced with kotlin/java/static-typing, and some from me just faking it til I make it.

Finally, after asking here, I chose Vertx for the web framework.

Today I got the vertx examples and I'm trying to compile them but I am finding the following errors:

Error:(116, 20) Kotlin: One type argument expected. Use 'AsyncErrorResult&lt;*&gt;' if you don't want to pass type arguments
The code always looks like is AsyncSuccessResult -&gt; println(""Received reply: $reply"")

What's the reason for this? It looks like the signature was changed but I don't fully understand why.

The other error is:

Error:(95, 56) Kotlin: Unresolved reference. None of the following candidates is applicable because of receiver type mismatch: 
@HidesMembers public inline fun &lt;T&gt; Iterable&lt;???&gt;.forEach(action: (???) -&gt; Unit): Unit defined in kotlin.collections
@HidesMembers public inline fun &lt;K, V&gt; Map&lt;???, ???&gt;.forEach(action: (Map.Entry&lt;???, ???&gt;) -&gt; Unit): Unit defined in kotlin.collections

The code looks like:
                is AsyncSuccessResult -&gt; result.result.forEach { println(it) }
This looks like a type issue but again, I am more interested in finding out why.

Are there new major changes to either Vertx or Kotlin 1.0.6 that would cause these issues to appear?

On the other hand I feel like having a lot of stuff in a constructer feels bad and makes the code look ugly and become harder to read imo(maybe if i food a good kotlin code formatting style this will not be an issue). 

on the 3rd hand I should not have a ton of params in a constructer that needs injecting any way so maybe that is  what I should rethink in my code.

I have an application where I need to watch a directory for files being created, deleted, or modified.  There may be a very large number of files in the directory, so polling isn't a good option.

[BarbaryWatchService](https://github.com/gjoseph/BarbaryWatchService) has an apparently efficient implementation native to Macs, but that requires checking the OS and picking the appropriate implementation.

There is also the fact that the WatchService API is very poorly designed, although that concern is secondary.

I'm hoping that someone has created a replacement for WatchService that is truly cross-platform, efficient, and ideally with a better-designed API.

23,2017-04-11 18:22:24,20,12,"I just started converting my android app into kotlin and came up with this:

    internal class ImageAdapter(private val mParent: AppCompatActivity, private val mAlbum: PostAlbum) : RecyclerView.Adapter&lt;ImageAdapter.ViewHolder&gt;() {
        private val inflater: LayoutInflater = LayoutInflater.from(mParent)
        ...
    }

This is a typical Adapter for a RecyclerView, I swear all of that is necessary.

* First of all 'internal' is necessary because I have multiple modules and while there isn't a name conflict I'd rather not add more things to autocomplete.
* 'mParent' is used for [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) and of course it's private
* 'mAlbum' is the data that backs the adapter
* Then this extends the abstract '[RecyclerView.Adapter](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter.html)'
* Which works with a nested viewholder
* The two arguments are absolutely necessary for the class to work so I guess it is best to put it in the primary constructor

Now I guess I can wrap it into multiple lines like this:

    internal class ImageAdapter(
        private val mParent: AppCompatActivity,
        private val mAlbum: PostAlbum)
    : RecyclerView.Adapter&lt;ImageAdapter.ViewHolder&gt;() {
        private val inflater: LayoutInflater = LayoutInflater.from(mParent)
        ...
    }

But now I have readability issues with this because the ""extends"" part is mixed in with all the other properties. Adding empty lines between the extends and the other properties in there kinda helps, but I can't help but think I'm doing something wrong.

I saw somewhere that this is apparently valid:

    internal class ImageAdapter(
        private val mParent: AppCompatActivity,
        private val mAlbum: PostAlbum)
    : RecyclerView.Adapter&lt;ImageAdapter.ViewHolder&gt;() {
        
        private val mParent: AppCompatActivity = mParent
        private val mAlbum: PostAlbum = mAlbum

note: the project is heavily work in progress, so far only few features are implemented:
- piece generation
- pieces collision
- move piece to left/right
- accelerate piece
- restart

features missing:
- score system (remove blocks in same row, assigning points)
- piece rotation

I am currently working on a frontend framework in Kotlin and decided to use the Snabbdom virtual DOM library for generating the DOM. The framework is meant to be to Kotlin what Vue, React, and Angular are to Javascript/Typescript.

Snabbdom is used in several frontend frameworks the most famous being Vue. I recently ported all of the Typescript definition files for Snabbdom over to Kotlin and I've released them as a library.

These definition files are completely ready to go, no additional modifications are needed to immediately start using Snabbdom and all it offers.

If you would like to use Snabbdom in your Kotlin frontend projects the definition files and how to use them are available here:

Think about testing a `HashSet` implementation.  You would want to add an object, the verify it is present, then delete it, then verify it is gone.  These things must occur in that order.

I could do something like this:

    ""Given a set"" - {
       val set = HashSet&lt;Int&gt;()
       ""on adding a value"" - {
           set += 5

           }

Is there any way to simulate C# object initializers in Kotlin?

        c.Legs = 7
        c.Color = ""Blue""

That works, but looks horrible.
The idea is to set props on an object that does not have a constructor or it in a single expression.

2)
`When` clauses

when (some.long.expression.withAnObject) {
                is Foo -&gt; dostuffFoo(foo)
                is Bar -&gt; dostuffBar(bar)
                is Baz -&gt; dostuffBaz(baz)
```

the above is ofc invalid syntax, but what would be the closest working fix for this?

89,2017-08-28 16:51:08,3,31,"Last week I was converting some Legacy code from Java to Kotlin (by hand, both so I could familiarize myself with what the code was doing as well as stamp out inefficiencies) when I ran into some interesting results from the Kotlin `File.copyTo` extension.

The Java code uses an internal IO helper library that was last touched nearly 10 years ago. In this case it used a function to copy a small (under 100 B) text file from one directory to another, as part of a loop through the source directory which can contain up to 2000 such files. My general rule has been, as part of the conversion process, to use as many native functions as possible. So far this has served me well. In this case, I replaced the internal library function call with `File.copyTo` and set the `overwrite` flag to `true`.

I have integration tests set up and when I ran them against the new functionality, the time to copy a full 2000 files jumped up from ~5 seconds to ~45 seconds. Naturally this gave me pause. From there, in an effort to understand what each bit of code was attempting to do, I dove into the API source code.

Kotlin's source for File.copyTo is [here](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/1.1.3/libraries/stdlib/src/kotlin/io/files/Utils.kt#L177).

The internal code cascades through a few different functions before it ends up here:

    public static boolean copyStream(InputStream is, OutputStream os, int bufferSize) {
        boolean copied = false;
        try {
            byte[] contents = new byte[bufferSize];

            int line;
            do {
            line = is.read(contents, 0, contents.length);
            if(line &gt; 0) {
                os.write(contents, 0, line);
             }
            } while(line != -1);

            streamCopied = true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println(e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace(System.err);
        } 

        return streamCopied;
    }

I found the difference in approaches almost immediately. When you set the flag for `overwrite` to `true` in `File.copyTo`, the Kotlin code *deletes* the destination file. Later on, it then creates the parent directory if needed, as well as the file. This forces a clean copy of the file to get created in the destination directory. I stepped back through the internal code and found a point where the destination file or parent directory gets created if it doesn't exist, but otherwise it simply writes to the existing file. 

However, if the files don't already exist, the internal code takes nearly as long to complete as the Kotlin code. At best it shaves off a second or two. So it's not so much that the internal code works better, it simply doesn't delete the destination file if it already exists.

I messed around for a bit, trying different things to get the results I was looking for, and finally settled on the following `File` extension function:

    fun File.copyTo(target: File, overwrite: Boolean = false, cleanCopy: Boolean = true, bufferSize: Int = DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE): File {
        if (!this.exists()) {
            throw NoSuchFileException(file = this, reason = ""The source file doesn't exists."")
        }

        if (target.exists()) {
            if (!overwrite)
                throw FileAlreadyExistsException(file = this, other = target, reason = ""The destination file already exists."")

            if (cleanCopy)
                target.delete()
        }

        if (this.isDirectory) {
            if (!target.mkdirs())
                throw FileSystemException(file = this, other = target, reason = ""Failed to create target directory."")
        } else {
            target.parentFile?.mkdirs()

            this.inputStream().use { input -&gt;
                target.outputStream().use { output -&gt;
                    input.copyTo(output, bufferSize)
                }
            }
        }

        return target
    }

Now when I run my integration tests, the file copy takes the same amount of time. I just need to call `source.copyTo(destination, overwrite = true, cleanCopy = false)` when I move to copy the files in question.

I don't know if the way the Kotlin team has the `File.copyTo` extension function working now is best practice, but I feel confident that I'll be okay given that my extension function is using the same basic file copy functionality as the internal library.","Kotlin's File.copyTo extension function, and a discovered side effect thereof"

93,2017-09-05 21:07:22,4,4,"Heyo. 

So I'm currently trying to replicate Golang's `go` syntax using the kotlinx.coroutines. For those uninitiated into the Cult of Go, you're able to simply say `go x()` where x is a function, or `go func {code}`. That will spawn off a coroutine that will run async and then kill itself when the code or function is done executing. Kotlin's Job system seems very, very heavily inspired by Go's system, which is nothing but a good thing. 

I'm trying to replicate this functionality in Kotlin, so I just made the following function:
`fun go(code: suspend () -&gt; Unit ) = launch(context=CommonPool, start=CoroutineStart.DEFAULT) {code}`

However, when I say `go {whatever}`, `whatever` doesn't run whatsoever; even simple things like `println(""Hello, World"")` don't. However, simply saying `launch(context=CommonPool, start=CoroutineStart.DEFAULT) {whatever}` works perfectly fine, it's just putting it in the function that screws it up.

Anything I'm missing? Thanks for any help!

So this is the 3rd iteration, and I am still working on it. But, I thought it was at a stage where I could give a little demo and not be too embarrassed. Open to feedback obviously.

Edit:

As requested, here is a bit more detail so you can decide if you want to actually spend the time watching an amateurish video or reading through lines of code.

 **Aims**

 * 2D only at this stage.
 * Slightly different from the excellently flexible and composable libGDX it is built on, Jenjin has an explicit architecture. It does have hooks for customization and plug-ability, but this can still be improved.
 * Reduce the general setup of a new game (Making screens, managing spritebatches, wiring inputs in, collision handling etc.)
 * Focus on the behavior of your objects and the rules of the game.

**Approach**

 * Declarative DSL for describing *SceneSpecs* which act like reusable and composable templates for creating 
 * Scene* instances.
 * Scenes are DAGs of Scene nodes for building up Scenes.
 * Scene Nodes are automatically pooled and reused. This does mean that pooling needs to be taken into account when defining your behavior components.
 * Physics is Box2D (obviously)
 *  DSL can describe Box2D lights, Sprites, Particles, shapes, animations and shaders (well, allows the plugging in of your GLSL shaders)
 * Behaviour is defined by pluggable and reusable components, and collisions are handled by pluggable reusable handlers.

**Very Simple Example**

You get the error 'Kotlin: An annotation can't be used as the annotations argument'

Well hell, we have annotations which require you do exactly that.

112,2017-10-24 04:55:54,15,3,"In DDD its considered good practice to create `value` objects which is what I thought data classes would be good at. Turns out I have encountered an issue that is making me sad.

I want to be able to do this but cant due to the warning **private data class constructor is exposed via the generated copy method**

    data class Email private constructor(val email: String) {
      companion object {
        fun create(email: String): Email? {
            return if (!email.contains(""@"")) null else Email(email)
        }
      }
    }

I completely understand this and makes sense. However I am frustrated that the only way I can get around this is to either

1. Just accept it and leak the copy constructor and hope no one will bypass the factory method..
2. Make all fields private and do some ugly hacks
3. Just use a class and implement all the boilerplate like I would in java which isn't appealing at all as this is the whole point of using kotlin to avoid all of that.

It seems I am not the only one questioning answers to this. 

The author in this article goes into examples and the purposed solution of using the class is ugly and mentions you have to hand roll the copy method which is error prone.

Its where I am a little lost, talking a look there are many different generators / ways of serving and I'm not sure what actually works and is simple.   My only complexity is some JWT / oauth stuff which is bog standard so some middleware to help that would be handy.

123,2017-11-25 02:49:29,12,7,"Ok, so this question may also apply to Java 8+ as well. I'm a professional Java developer, but my company is still sticking to the Java 7 language level even now (using the 8 SDK/JRE, but we frequently need to backport code to clients, so we're sticking with 7 language features for now). Anyway, my point is that with kotlin I'm getting most of my exposure to all those cool functions added in Java 8 for handling collections. And this brings up the true point of my question, as exhibited by this function:

    fun groupLinesByTable(lines: Sequence&lt;String&gt;): Map&lt;String,List&lt;String&gt;&gt;{
            val pattern = Pattern.compile(TABLE_NAME_PATTERN)
            return lines.filter { line -&gt; !line.trim().isEmpty() }.groupBy { line -&gt;
                val matcher = pattern.matcher(line)
                if(matcher.find()){
                    line.substring(matcher.start()..(matcher.end() - 1)).trim()
                }
                else{
                    ""OTHER""
                }
            }
        }

So, the main point being made in this function is I'm taking a sequence and running two separate functions on it. The first is a filter to remove any empty strings, the second is a groupBy function to organize it by the value retrieved using a regex on each line.

When I look at this, it's very nice and pretty declarative code, but I wonder about its performance. From what I can see, I would think this code would iterate through all of the strings in the Sequence twice, once for the filter and again for groupBy. This seems... bad. In this use case, the number of items in the collection won't be big enough for it to matter, but I'm more wondering about this in the abstract.

So, is running multiple functions like this on a collection a potential drag on performance, or is there some compiler magic that happens behind the scenes to make this all work great?

        enumClass: KClass&lt;T&gt;: EnumStub.ConfiguredQuery&lt;T, A&gt;

## Intro

If you are not familiar with Zircon yet, you can

- read the [previous release notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/73ozl4/zircon_a_text_gui_library_version_201720_released/)
- read the [README](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/README.md) which also contains some screenshots

---
## New Features

We've been busy working on some new stuff for Zircon like:
  

### The `GameComponent`

In this release we introduce the new [`GameComponent`](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/org/codetome/zircon/api/component/GameComponent.kt) which solves issue [#42](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/42).
Its purpose is to provide a `Component` which you can add to your UI and with which you can display your game area
in an easy to use way. It comes with its own [`Builder`](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/org/codetome/zircon/api/component/builder/GameComponentBuilder.kt), **scrolling** and some additional classes:

- [`GameArea`](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/org/codetome/zircon/api/game/GameArea.kt) is intended to be an
adapter between your game and the Zircon GUI with methods for getting and setting `TextCharacters` and groups of `TextCharacters` on the screen. A `GameArea`
is basically a 3D cube representing the whole game field.
 You can implement your own `GameArea` if you like or use the built-in [`TextImageGameArea`](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/org/codetome/zircon/internal/game/TextImageGameArea.kt) which is good for trying things out.
- [`GameAreaSegment`](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/org/codetome/zircon/api/game/GameAreaSegment.kt) represents a single
level (Z-layer) of a `GameArea`.
- With [`ProjectionMode`](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/org/codetome/zircon/api/game/ProjectionMode.kt) you can decide
between using a `TOP_DOWN` (like in Dwarf Fortress) or an `ISOMETRIC` view. [Here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/388833462402154497/GIF.gif) is an example of how `TOP_DOWN` looks like and [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/391379033612353546/isometric.gif) is an example for the `ISOMETRIC` view.


#### Some more info

- Each layer of a `GameComponent` is layered. This way you can have multiple `TextCharacter`s over each other in the same 3D position.
  This works in a way like you can expect from a `Layerable`.
- In `ISOMETRIC` mode you can expect objects which are further from the user's viewpoint to be overlapped properly with objects
  which are closer to the user
- The `GameComponent` is still in *Beta* so we'd like to **hear about your opinions and ideas** about it. We'd like to figure out a way
  which makes this easy-to-use for you
  

### Multi-font support

That's right! After solving [#31](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/31) you are finally able to use multiple fonts
in the same `Terminal`, `Screen`, `Layer` or `Component`! Currently you can only use `Font`s which have the same size but you
can mix and match *CP437* and *Graphic* tilesets. In a later version we'll add support for mixing in *half-width* `Font`s as well!
[This](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/277739394641690625/367091561508503552/GIF.gif) is an example of multi-font support
in action.


### TextCharacterString support 

`TextCharacterString`s are an aggregation of `TextCharacter`s into an array. You can draw a `TextCharacterString` onto any `DrawSurface` and you can expect it to behave in a way like handwriting would (if a string does not fit in a line it continues in a new line).

Text wrapping is managed by `TextWrap` which is an `enum` with `NO_WRAPPING` and `WRAP`  options.

`TextCharacterString` comes with its own builder and you can create them in a simple way from plain Java `String`s.

---
## Enhancements

We've also worked on some nuisances which were present:
  

### Usability enhancements

[#44](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/44) solves an usability issue which arises if you try to put a non-printable character on the screen.
**Great thanks** to [Coldwarrl](https://github.com/coldwarrl) for submitting a PR for this.

With [#39](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/39) we added `putCharacter` to the `Screen` as well and also an overload
variant which takes `TextCharacter`s.

With [#43](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/43) done font caching is now optional. You can turn it off when creating your `Terminal`
with a `TerminalBuilder`.


### Internal changes

Solving [#37](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/37) laid the groundwork for writing truly platform-independent
`Font` handling.

This is important for encapsulating the draw logic without hard-coding GUI technology-specific details. So `BufferedImage` will became `FontTextureRegion` which will have methods which will have different implementations depending on the underlying GUI tech (`BufferedImage` in Java2D and `TextureRegion` in libGDX for example). Currently it just delegates to the proper backend.

---
## Bug fixes

These are the known bugs which were solved:

### [#45](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/45) fixed
&gt; Setting the `TRANSPARENT` background for `TextImage` does not work

### [#52](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/52) fixed
&gt; `TextBox`: `setText` does not refresh the draw surface

### [#41](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/41) fixed
&gt; Wrong symbol/glyph is displayed

This was a **tough one**. It was caused by a `hashCode` collision. Shoutout to [Coldwarrl](https://github.com/coldwarrl) for helping to solve this!

### [#40](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/40) fixed
&gt; Bug in `TextCharacterString`

## Roadmap

We've laid out the direction for the project so here are the milestones we'd like to reach for the next release:

- Proper `FontTextureRegion` abstraction for different backends. This is a must if we want to have multiple GUI backends
  (Swing, JavaFX and libGDX in the first version).
- Proper modularization depending on GUI backend
  Zircon will be split into multiple modules: `zircon.core`, `zircon.swing`, `zircon.javafx` and `zircon.libgdx` for start.
  Since from `1.2` Kotlin supports multiplatform projects this will be rather easy to do so and in the end you'll only have
  to include the version you need in your own project.
- We'll also need to add *libGDX* and *JavaFX* support to the respective modules
- Component wrapping is right now a mess, but we need to fix this. It is not explicit currently but when you call `wrapInBox`
  or `addShadow` with any `Component` you use a wrapper. This will be made explicit in the future and you'll be able to
  add your own wrappers.

This has the effect of the speed dropping by .01 every time you open the dialog. Very frustrating. Any help appreciated.

in a traditional spring boot application you would just write your javascript code in:

in the kotlin multiplatoform you have this as the basic structure:

    	override fun &lt;R2&gt; mapRight(mapper: (Nothing) -&gt; R2): Either&lt;L, R2&gt; = this
    	override fun left(): L = value
    	override fun right(): Nothing? = null

    data class Right&lt;out R&gt;(val value: R) : Either&lt;Nothing, R&gt;() {
    	override fun &lt;T&gt; either(leftHandler: (Nothing) -&gt; T, rightHandler: (R) -&gt; T): T = rightHandler(value)
    	override fun &lt;L2&gt; mapLeft(mapper: (Nothing) -&gt; L2): Either&lt;L2, R&gt; = this

    	override fun right(): R = value

I want to now add new methods `left(orElse: Function&lt;out L&gt;): L` and `right(orElse: Function&lt;out R&gt;): R`, however, I get a compile error `Type parameter L is declared as 'out' but occurs in 'in' position in type Function&lt;out L&gt;`.

The intended purpose of the `left(orElse: Function&lt;out L&gt;): L` is that if `this` were a `Left`, it'd just return the `value` in `Left`; otherwise, it calls the provided `orElse` function to generate a value of type `L`.

(Aside: I get that there are easy workarounds to accomplish the same thing, e.g. I could use the elvis operator like `either.left() ?: orElseValue`, but my goal here is to learn Kotlin generic projections.)

It feels like what I want should be possible, even with variance. If I have a `val` of type `Either&lt;Number, String&gt;`, then because of variance, the object being referenced might actually be an `Either&lt;Int, String&gt;` or whatever, but in every context that I'm actually using my `val`, my code is able to handle a `Number` (and thus by LSP, it can handle an `Int`). If I then want to get the left value, but default to, say `Float.NaN`, then I should be able to just provide my `Function&lt;Float&gt;`, which again due to variance, is a `Function&lt;Number&gt;`, and thus should be legal to pass into my `left(orElse: Function&lt;Number&gt;): L` method. And sure, `Int` and `Float` are different types, but since at compile time I'm dealing with a `val` of type `Either&lt;Number, String&gt;`, all my code would be written to handle `Number`, which should be able to handle both `Int` and `Float`:

    val eitherNumberOrString: Either&lt;Number, String&gt; = Left&lt;Int&gt;(1)
    val number: Number = eitherNumberOrString.left { Float.NaN }
    number.toDouble() //Should be able to call any method defined on Number

Since I don't feel too comfortable with js, I went ahead and created typings for kotlin-js (with some help from ts2kt).

* External class is almost always better than external interface
* Accessing (untyped) json objects still feels klunky
* Overall the interop with js is very good

val logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass::class.java)
```

## The kotlin way
We like short code, and we like DRY.
So here are 3 other ways of getting a logger, to avoid repeating the tedious `LoggerFactory` stuff:

### 1. Factory function

- Function definition is easy to understand, but usage requires the class name.
- Gives the correct logger class name in companions.

**Code**:

    inline fun &lt;reified T&gt; logger(): Logger {
        return LoggerFactory.getLogger(T::class.java)
    }


**Usage**:

    class LogWithFactoryFunction {
        val logger = logger&lt;LogWithFactoryFunction&gt;()
    
        fun doSomething() {
            logger.info(""Hey from a delegate!"")
        }
    }
    
    class LogWithCompanionFactoryFunction {
        companion object {
            val logger = logger&lt;LogWithFactoryFunction&gt;()
        }
    
        fun doSomething() {
            logger.info(""Hey from a delegate!"")
        }
    }

---

### 2. Companion with inheritance

- No visible `logger` property in your code; it's available through the companion object
- Logger gets `$Companion` in the logger name
- Interface version asks for a logger each time, causing slf4j to check it's initialization state

**Code**: 

    abstract class Log {
        val logger: Logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this.javaClass)
    }

or

    interface Log {
        fun log() = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this.javaClass)
    }

**Usage**:

    class LogWithCompanion {
        companion object : Log() {}
    
        fun doSomething() {
            logger.info(""Hey from a companion!"")
        }
    }

or

    class LogWithInterfaceCompanion {
        companion object : ILog {}
    
        fun doSomething() {
            log().info(""Hey from a companion!"")
        }
    }

---

### 3. Delegate property

- Harder to understand delegate source code
- Logger gets `$Companion` in the logger name if placed in a companion


**Code**:

    class LoggerDelegate : ReadOnlyProperty&lt;Any?, Logger&gt; {
    
        companion object {
            private fun &lt;T&gt;createLogger(clazz: Class&lt;T&gt;) : Logger {
                return LoggerFactory.getLogger(clazz)
            }
        }
    
        private var logger: Logger? = null
    
        override operator fun getValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty&lt;*&gt;): Logger {
            if (logger == null) {
                logger = createLogger(thisRef!!.javaClass)
            }
            return logger!!
        }
    }

**Usage**:

    class LogWithDelegate {
        val logger by LoggerDelegate()
    
        fun doSomething() {
            logger.info(""Hey from a delegate!"")
        }
    }

## Opinions?

Do you have a different way of doing it?  
Which version do you prefer, and why?

Thanks for reading.
Hope you learned a cool new way of creating loggers! :)

I've figured out through poking around that this is basically saying T is of type Any (any type) and then build a extension off that type. Why wouldn't you instead do

Also, it gets more complicated with a function mentioned in a other user's post here

        val (foo, bar) = it.orders.partition { it.isDelivered }

Comparing with this (very approximate) Ruby syntax:

```
shop.customers.filter { |it|
        (foo, bar) = it.orders.partition { |itt| itt.isDelivered }
        foo.count() &lt; bar.count()
    }.toSet()

So Kotlin and Ruby are using similar syntax for anonymous function parameters (|it|). I can also pass 2 parameters into an anonymous function in Ruby, what's the syntax for doing this in Kotlin?

```
h = { ""a"" =&gt; 100, ""b"" =&gt; 200 }
h.each_pair {|key, value| puts ""#{key} is #{value}"" }
```

(I'm referring to |key,value| here).

**Edit**.

Sorry, brain-fart. Solution was to read the [Lambdas documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html), where an example is given:

```
val items = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
val joinedToString = items.fold(""Elements:"", { acc, i -&gt; acc + "" "" + i })

vs

items = [1,2,3,4,5]

Created a small ""test class"" on my project, ran it within IntelliJ IDEA, no errors! Now let's try running it on my production server... huh? `unresolved reference`? but... why? heck, if that class didn't exist you wouldn't even be able to be called at all!

	javax.script.ScriptException: error: unresolved reference: mrpowergamerbr
	fun loritta(context: com.mrpowergamerbr.loritta.commands.CommandContext) {
							 ^

Yeah, for some reason Kotlin Script Engine can't find my classes, or anything at all actually, but... why? They surely exist in runtime because, if they didn't, the app wouldn't even run!

Then after thinking and searching at Google, I stumbled upon this [YouTrack issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-21443) however it was related to fat JARs, and my production app wasn't using a fat JAR, but I decided to investigate...

And after countless tries, I finally got it working! But why it wasn't working... well...

Today I decided to stop building fat JARs, before my JAR was a [good boye](https://i.redd.it/b8mwhr9p1l8z.jpg), weighting only ~10MBs... but because my app was growing with more features, the JAR kept growing due to new dependencies and new code being added... then the JAR was ~70MBs and the good boye wasn't a good boye anymore, it was a [fatty boye](https://i.imgur.com/UaEscmK.jpg)

So I decided to scrap it, stopping building the fat JAR shaved off 10s from my build time (and shaved ~20s seconds when copying the JAR to production, instead now I copy only the libraries when I need it to update it!), made every dependency be exported to a  `libs/` folder and made Maven add the `Class-Path` to the `MANIFEST.MF` and everything worked great! ...except Kotlin's Script Engine.

The reason it doesn't work is because, for some reason, Kotlin's Script Engine wasn't even getting my own classes from the JAR! But wait, there is a fix.

You can add all your libraries manually via the `-Dkotlin.script.classpath=jar1:jar2:jar3:jar4` on your startup script... buuuut that's too boring and you will need to update it on every library update/added/remove... so let's rely on code!

	val path = this::class.java.protectionDomain.codeSource.location.path
	val jar = JarFile(path)
	val mf = jar.manifest
	val mattr = mf.mainAttributes
	// Yes, you SHOULD USE Attributes.Name.CLASS_PATH! Don't try using ""Class-Path"", it won't work!
	val manifestClassPath = mattr[Attributes.Name.CLASS_PATH] as String

	// The format within the Class-Path attribute is different than the one expected by the property, so let's fix it!
	// By the way, don't forget to append your original JAR at the end of the string!
	val propClassPath = manifestClassPath.replace("" "", "":"") + "":Loritta-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar""

	// Now we set it to our own classpath
	System.setProperty(""kotlin.script.classpath"", propClassPath)

And after that, you can evaluate your code (even if it relies on external classes) without any issues! Yay!

	javaScript = ""fun test() { println(\""Hello World\!\"") }""

	val engine = ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName(""kotlin"")
	engine.eval(javaScript)
	val invocable = engine as Invocable
	invocable.invokeFunction(""test"")

For those who don't know, Javalin is a lightweight Kotlin and Java web framework which focuses on simplicity and Kotlin/Java interoperability ([read more on our website](https://javalin.io)). We're almost done with version 2.0, so we're looking for some feedback/bug reports.

 

**Download/feedback issue:** https://github.com/tipsy/javalin/issues/280

**Gitter chat:** https://gitter.im/javalin-io/general

 

### What's changed since Javalin 1.7 ?

According to the gitlog, 180+ files have changed, with ~5000 additions and ~5500 deletions (which is more or less the entire code base).
Most of the changes are internal; some abstraction layers have been removed and the WebSocket implementation has been completely rewritten.

Some of the major changes are:

* We've added ETag support and a method for auto-generating ETags
* We've added a RequestLogger interface (`{ ctx, executionTime -&gt; ...}`)
* We've added the option to return 405 instead of 404, listing available methods for the path
* We've added a set of default responses, so you can `throw BadRequestResponse()` (optional message)
* We've added a `CrudHandler` to remove some boilerplate from creating standard CRUD APIs
* We've added support for WebJars ([https://www.webjars.org](https://www.webjars.org))
* We've improved support for Single Page Applications
* We've improved exception handling for async requests
* All JSON and Template functionality has been modularized so you can easily plug in your own mappers/rendering engines.
* All Template functionality has been moved into a single `ctx.render()` function which uses the correct engine based on the file extension
* All requests run through an AccessManager now (but the default implementation is NOOP)
* URL matching is now case-insensitive by default (call `app.enableCaseSensitiveUrls()` if you must)
* Javalin now has a pac4j implementation ([https://github.com/pac4j/javalin-pac4j](https://github.com/pac4j/javalin-pac4j))
* Some default values have been changed

There are also a lot quality of life improvements, such as functions returning `List` instead of `Array`, returning empty collections instead of null, better default values and package structure, fixing visibility from Java, etc. Multiple bugs were hurt in the making of the new version.",Javalin 2.0 final release candidate is out

async { getMyData() }.await().then { entity -&gt; when (entity ) is Found -&gt; {} , is Failure -&gt; {} }

suspend fun getMyData(): Entity&lt;T,E&gt;

sealed class Entity {

data class Found(...) : Entity()

data class Failure(...) : Entity()

}

\`\`\`

First one looks and feels functional but the second one is similar to the Flux world when we using a switch/case for all possible events.

I prefer the first way but the Kotlin Style discouraged it and the reason is the less control on error handling !?

So it seems all of columns get written out in alphabetical order rather than in the order I defined.

For example if class foo has properties:

Name,
Age,
IQ

The csv file would look like:

`“Age”,”IQ”,”Name”
“24”,”100”,”Bob”`

I’ve tried it with both Jackson and also openCSV and I’m getting the same issue. So it presume it has something to do with the way the JVM handles class property order.

To verify this I tried checking Class.declaredFields and it looks like they are stored in the order in which they are written. So I have no idea how to get around the issue.

Here’s some of my sample code using openCSV and also Jackson (I removed some boiler plate code from the Jackson sample, but left everything involving creating the csv schema and writing):

**OpenCSV**

`/**
 * Takes a mutable map and writes it to a file.
 *
 * @param filename location of csv file to be written
 * @param data map containing the data to be written
 * @schema T schema for csv parser
 * @usage csvWriter(System.getProperty(“user.dir”) + “/out/csv/output.csv”, data)

        .withQuotechar(CSVWriter.DEFAULT_QUOTE_CHARACTER)
        .build()

    beantoCsvBuilder.write(outputCsvList)
}

261,2018-10-03 23:05:53,21,1,"Hi, I'm currently trying to get used to write kotlin to maybe make some fun android app in the future. I am used to writing python and love that kotlin have some of the pythonic features such as the way of looping using enumerate:

    # python
    a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    for index, value in enumerate(a):
        print(index, value)

I know this can be done in kotlin using the method .withIndex()

    // kotlin
    val a = listOf(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
    for ((index, value) in a.withIndex()) {
        println(""$index, $value"")
    }

What I would like to know is if I can go deeper with the unpacking, in python I can do:

    # python
    a = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]
    for index, (odd, even) in enumerate(a):
        print(index, odd, even)

I have tried to use the same syntax in kotlin and doesn't (for what I can tell) more than one reason (reading IntelliJs error messages) work like this.

    // kotlin
    val a = listOf(listOf(1, 2), listOf(3, 4), listOf(5, 6))
    for (index, (odd, even) in a.withIndex()) { // massive amounts of errors
        println(""$index, $odd, $value"")
    }

How would this be achieved with kotlin? I am currently working with a zipped list and having the index without refereeing to the list[index] all over the place would be very nice.

## Intro

Zircon is a user-friendly Text GUI &amp; Tile Engine. Take a look [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/205245036084985857/481213000540225550/full_example.gif).

## Highlights of this release

This release was mainly about making Zircon more robust and prepare it to be used in a multiplatform environment
(jvm, browser, native). There are also some new enhancements and features added, like:

- New True Type Fonts. Take a look [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/485181978031947787/unknown.png),

- Multi-size Tile support: [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/205245036084985857/482557725432086538/unknown.png).
- Markov Chain based `Modifiers` like [bubbly lava effect](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/491268920217698304/lava.gif),

- Component decoration [refurbishment](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/493152143310585886/unknown.png).
- New components, like the [TextBox](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/497789071943401482/textbox.gif)
  which also supports inline `Component`s and typing effects
- The [LogArea component](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/497907392676233217/logscrolling.gif).
- New [color themes](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/480148560160096267/color_themes.gif).
- A new example [tutorial project](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/479419587507650580/GIF.gif) following

## New Features

There are numerous new features in this release:

- [#100](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/100): *Support all Input events on components properly.*

  Now all `Input` events can be properly listened to on `Component`s: `InputListener`s can be added or
  the specific listener methods can be called with a lambda like `onDrag` or `onMouseReleased`
- [#90](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/90): *Add the option to enable beta features in Zircon*

  Now there is a switch in `AppConfig` which can be used to enable beta features like `Animation`s and
  the `GameComponent`
- [#89](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/89): *Add the option to run Zircon in debug mode*

  This can also be enabled now from `AppConfig`. It will display specific log entries and also the current
  FPS. This feature will be enhanced later.
- [#76](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/76): *Introduce ShutdownHook in Zircon*

  Now `ShutdownHook` can be used to notify the user before Zircon closes  
- [#75](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/75): *Improve Animation to return an AnimationResult*

  Starting an `Animation` will now return a handle which can be used to interact with the `Animation` (like `stop`ping it).  
- [#54](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/54): *Embedding images/bitmaps*  
- [#46](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/46): *Implement ""Log"" Component*

  The `LogArea` component was implemented *(great thanks to **coldwarrl**!)*.
- [#8](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/8): *TileColor transformations*

  The following transformations were implemented:
  - `tint`: adding a different color to this one
  - `shade`: lighten or darken the color
  - `invert`: flip the color to its opposite (blue vs red for example)
  

## Enhancements

These are the **enhancements** which were done in this release:

- [#112](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/112): *Allow Position and Size to have negative values, and add a check in the components framework not to allow them there.*
- [#107](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/107): *Reconcile the usage of properties vs functions (eg: size(), position() vs size and position*

  These were streamlined and the weird getters (`position()`, `size()`, etc) are now gone. Now there is a proper getter / setter
  for everything and mutator/transformer methods which return the object are prefixed with `with*`.
- [#105](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/105): *Separate Modifier into tile transformer and texture transformer modifiers.*

  Now there are two kinds of `Modifier`s. One which modifies how textures are transformed, and one which can modify a `Tile` before
  it is rendered.
- [#103](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/103): *Reconcile getTileAt, setTileAt, getRelativeTileAt and setRelativeTileAt.*

  These were ""sanetized"" now it is straightforward and well documented which is which and how to use them.
- [#102](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/102): *Provide a proper `Snapshot` object for `snapshot()` instead of a `Map`*

  Now the `snapshot()` method returns a proper `Snapshot` object instead of just a `Map`. 
- [#84](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/84): *Font to Tile refactor*

  This was a rather thorough change. Previously Zircon used the `Font` abstraction which was now refactored
  to `Tile` and `TilesetResource` which streamlines and simplifies how `Tile`s can be loaded and used.
  It is now also easier to write support for new kinds of fonts, tiles, and such.
- [#83](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/83): *Refactor Blink handling and Animation handling to be part of the incremental rendering*

  `Blink` and `Animation` timing is now handled by the continuous renderer. This does not change how the API
  works, but makes the code of Zircon more robust, and less error prone.
- [#82](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/82): *Continuous rendering*

  Now Zircon does continuous rendering: the user will no longer have to call `refresh` and other such methods
  in order to redraw the screen. The `Application` class was also introduced to accommodate this change.
- [#81](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/81): *Multiplatform refactor*

  The majority of the code in `zircon.jvm` were moved to `zircon.core` which is a Kotlin common project.
  This will enable the development of javascript and native variants of Zircon.
  [#84](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/84) made this possible. Now images can be drawn onto
  a `DrawSurface` using the `ImageDictionaryTilesetResource`. The related example can be found [here](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/blob/c9b3edebc2dc7ae66d58419900523f54579eb370/zircon.examples/src/main/kotlin/org/hexworks/zircon/examples/ImageTileExample.kt)
  and it looks like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/473082395562737694/unknown.png). 
- [#74](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/74): *Streamline how Positions and Sizes work*

  Previously it was not possible to create `Position`s with a negative component (`x`, or `y`), not it
  is possible, and it is only limited in specific places (like `Component`s)
- [#73](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/73): *Improve TileGraphics performance*

  `TileGraphics` used arrays before, now it uses sparse `Map`s. This enhances performance, and also makes it possible
  to have `TileGraphics` with stupid size.  
- [#69](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/69): *CombineWith should resize new image to fit TileGraphics*

  When `combineWith` is called on a `TileGraphics` it will properly be resized to accommodate the other image.
- [#67](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/67): *Add word wrap to CharacterTileString*

  `CharacterTileString` now supports word wrap!
- [#61](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/61): *Proper `FontTextureRegion` abstraction for different backends.*

  Previously `Tile` drawing for different backends (Swing, LibGDX, etc) was a bit convoluted. Now this is streamlined.
- [#60](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/60): *Proper modularization depending on GUI backend*

  Zircon was split into multiple projects (`zircon.core`, `zircon.jvm`, `zircon.jvm.swing`, `zircon.jvm.libgdx`). This makes
  the artifacts more lightweight, and the codebase is also separated along the GUI framework backends.
- [#59](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/59): *Component wrapping refurbishment*

  Component wrapping was refactored. Now `ComponentDecorationRenderer`s can be added to any `Component` during creation.
  This makes it possible to apply any decoration to any component. 
- [#55](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/55): *Fix and test TextBox*

  This was a bit convoluted before, now it is better and has more tests.
- [#38](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/38): *Half-width Tile support*

  Now it is possible to use `TilesetResource`s which are not square, there are also some added tilesets like
  `Acorn` and `Lord Nightmare`.
- [#32](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/32): *Tile alignment by pixel*

  Now `Tile`s can be aligned by using `AbsolutePosition`. Note that this feature is still in beta.


## Bug fixes

The following **bugs** were *fixed*:

- [#111](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/111): Fix RadioButton.select() to change the selection in its parent as well
- [#77](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/77): Swing terminal is not being redrawn in response to exposure event 
- [#66](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/66): Adding Components to a Container which is not yet attached to a ContainerHandler will lead to positioning problems
- [#65](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/65): RadioButtonGroup throws stacktrace if you click empty space
- [#64](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/64): Minimizing a swing terminal and then restoring it causes the screen to go grey
- [#47](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/47): Adding a component to a container which has no font before attaching that container to a Screen leads to font error.


## Roadmap
  
There are several things on the radar, like:

- Refactor parallelism and concurrency to use Kotlin coroutines
- Implement a Javascript (browser) module and finish the LibGDX implementation
- Finish custom `Component` support
- Add **floating**, **modal** and **scrollable** components
- `Component` layout support
- Drag'n drop support
- Component themes
- Simple and easy to use data binding and MVC support

I have this app idea and I want to learn kotlin to make it. I know a little bit about programming and I feel that some of the things the app would do might be challenging to program.

* The app will stream video lessons and I want to give my users the choice to download these vodeos on their phones. However, I want to make those videos only accessible from inside the app, no mp4 files in the file manager.
I guess that requires some sort of encryption. But I don't really know.

* Most of the app users will be using limited 3G networks, so not all of them might not be able to downlod videos. I want my app to make it possible for users who have the app on their phones to share videos they've downloaded with each other. While still maintaining the encryption descriped above.

For example, a generic camera module you can use in code rather than coding to platform specific sdk's.  Or for example you dont write an andoird actibvity and ios veiw in seperate ways, you write 1 veiw which gets compiled into an ios + android app. 

From what I read the kotlin native multiplatform stuff allows the writing of ios + android apps in kotlin, allows the sharing of common kotlin modules (e.g. MyFancyMathLib.kt) but you still effectivly need to write 2 apps, the IOS one making ios views and whatnots, accessing the ios camera etc and a second one for android to access the android specific things.

Anyone know of any expo like libraries built or being built ontop of the kotlin multiplatform stuff that can abstract away some of the multiplatform sdk pains so that you can have 1 codebase, i.e. defining 1 view that produces the 2 apps. Like  Expo with kotlin not javascript essentially.

I'm using IDEA 2018.3 and Serialization 0.9.0, these are the latest versions. The Kotlin version needed to be downgraded to 1.3.0 to support the Serialization library.

I'm using Maven and I've followed all the [plugin instructions](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization#setup), including the step where I delegate the build to Maven.

I've checked the target folder and the decompiled class file has the serializer() function in it. Perfect.

The problem is that the IDEA editor still shows the serializer() function in red and when I hover over it says ""unresolved reference"". It seems like IDEA is doing its own compilation on the sly but doesn't know it needs to generate the serializer() function.

&gt;
&gt; If you are not yet familiar with the project take a look at our
&gt; [Project Page](https://hexworks.org/projects/zircon/).

&gt; You can grab this release from Jitpack [here](https://jitpack.io/#org.hexworks/zircon/2018.12.25-XMAS).
&gt; Maven Central synchronization will come soon as well.

## Highlights of this release

This release contains numerous usability upgrades and the introduction of new `Component` types
like `Modal`s and the `Icon` `Component`. We also worked on fleshing out the inner workings of
the `GameArea` based on feedback from our users.

We also started working on [Caves of Zircon](https://github.com/Hexworks/caves-of-zircon) which
is a tutorial project which has the goal to get you started with writing roguelike games!
The project is almost complete and when it is ready a series of tutorial articles will follow.
Take a look at some game footage [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/509142267735310338/522176966984597545/GIF.gif).

Apart from a tutorial project there is now also a Java and a Kotlin skeleton project which you
can download to get started with Zircon without the need to manually set up a project.
The Java skeleton can be found [here](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon.skeleton.java)
and the Kotlin one is [here](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon.skeleton.kotlin). 

What's also important to mention is that now we have a **LibGDX Renderer** for Zircon! It is in
beta right now, but we'll get it to production-ready state for the next release. Thanks for @Ender_L
for contributing it to the project! With this it is now possible to **run Zircon in the browser**.
We'll put up an example with this soon.

## New Features

- [#1](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/1): *LibGDX rendering support*
  Yea, **this was the first issue** in our issue tracker and now we have it in BETA.
  Thanks for the contribution, @Ender_L! [These](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363754040103796737/521809619186745347/unknown.png)

  CP437 fonts are supported now together with `Input` handling. `Animation`, `Modifier` and the remaining tileset
  support will come in the next release! 
- [#24](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/24): *Modal (dialog) support*
  This one was on the Road map for quite some time, but it is ready now! Take a
  look at this [example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/514477514161389599/dialog_example.gif).
- [#121](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/121): *Programmatic focus for Components*
  Now it is possible to programmatically focus `Component`s. Take a look at an example
  [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/510230515429670922/focus_handling_example.gif).
- [#153](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/153): *Implement Ellipse Factory*
  Now you can draw not only triangles, rectangles and boxes, but also ellipse shapes!
  Thanks for @Milo for this contribution!
- [#156](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/156): *Databinding Iteration 1*
  Zircon now supports databinding. It looks like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363754040103796737/525042125151141939/data_binding_with_labels.gif).
  This feature might be familiar from JavaFX or some other UI framework. The basic premise is that
  you can create `Property` instances which you can bind to other properties and their values
  will change together. Databinding is possible uni-, and bidirectionally and it is implemented
  for the basic `Component`s in Zircon.
- [#171](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/171): *Fragment Support*
  A `Fragment` is a re-usable `Component` container which contains a `root` `Component`
  (which can also be a `Container` and can be added to either a `Container` or a `Screen`.
- [#172](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/172): *Implement the Icon Component*
  An `Icon` `Component` is a regular `Component` which has a size of 1x1 and holds a single `GraphicTile`.
  It looks like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363754040103796737/526092651775393809/unknown.png)
  and can be used to put icons on your UI.
  


## Enhancements

- [#132](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/132): `TextArea`s now can be [enabled and disabled](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/509836757798354954/text_area_enable_disable.gif)
  once again. This feature was removed previously because of some technical limitations, but now it is fixed.
- [#133](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/133): `Layer`s are now clearable
- [#145](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/145): `Component` alignment is now easier
  with the new alignment functions. Take a look [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363771631727804416/515978944948994048/component-positioning.png).
- [#152](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/152): Borders now support custom width
  and also custom color like in [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/363754040103796737/519083254284943360/unknown.png)
  example.
- [#154](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/154): Handling `Input`s are now easier with
  some new convenience features like `whenInputTypeIs` and `whenCharacterIs`.
- [#155](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/155) `GameArea` now supports adding overlays.
  This is useful for creating things like Fog of War effects as seen in [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/509142267735310338/525811202551447553/coz_xp.gif)

You can clone and run the following pre-configured [template project](https://github.com/marcoferrer/kotlin-coroutines-gRPC-template) to get started. Existing Kroto+ users can add the `grpc_coroutines{}` to their build configuration.

* **Back pressure** is supported via [Manual Flow Control](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/tree/master/examples/src/main/java/io/grpc/examples/manualflowcontrol)
   * Related Reading: [Understanding Reactive gRPC Flow Control](https://github.com/salesforce/reactive-grpc#back-pressure)
* **Cooperative cancellation** is propagated across network boundaries. Meaning a cancelled client `coroutineContext` attached to a stub will cancel the related rpc job within the service impl.
* Full Bi-directional streaming using coroutine Channels
* Client Stubs
   * Implement `CoroutineScope` interface
   * Designed to work well with **Structured Concurrency**
   * Cancellations can now be propagated across usages of a specific stub instance.
   * Rpc methods are overloaded with inline builders for request types

&amp;#8203;

    // CLIENT
    val stub = GreeterCoroutineGrpc.newStub(channel)
        .withCoroutineContext() // or .withCoroutineContext(coroutineContext)
    
    val response = stub.sayHello { name = ""John"" }
    
    // SERVICE
    override suspend fun sayHello(request: HelloRequest): HelloReply = coroutineScope {
        if (isValid(request.name))
            HelloReply { message = ""Hello there, ${request.name}!"" } else
            throw Status.INVALID_ARGUMENT.asRuntimeException()
    }

Examples for other rpc variations can be found [here](https://github.com/marcoferrer/kroto-plus#examples).

Kroto+ also supports generating lambda based builders and extensions for proto messages. 

        val attack = Attack {
            name = ""ORA ORA ORA""
            damage = 100
            range = StandProto.Attack.Range.CLOSE
        }
        
        //Copy extensions are also generated
        val newAttack = attack.copy { damage = 200 }            
        
        //As well as plus operator extensions 
        val mergedAttack = attack + Attack { name = ""Sunlight Yellow Overdrive"" }

310,2019-01-12 10:31:04,5,1,"Let's say we have:

```
data class MyModel(val id: String, val a: String, val b: Int, val c: LocalDate)
```

This is fine, but what do we do when we want to create a new entity in the web UI, and receive that (in kotlin) from our API? I.e. our choices would (seem to) be either a) allow id to be nullable or b) allow the UI to choose an id, even if temporary (both of which seem undesirable).

We've been noodling around with using a dynamic proxy to implement an interface, and having our data class also implement that interface. That is, our entity now becomes:

```
    // implementation of ProxyDeserializer comes next
    class MyModelDeserializer: ProxyDeserializer&lt;MyModel&gt;(MyModel::class.java)

    @JsonDeserialize(using = MyModelDeserializer::class)
    interface MyModel { val a: String ; val b: Int ; val c: LocalDate }

    data class MyModelEntity(val id: String, override val a: String, override val b: Int, override val c: LocalDate) : MyModel
```

Now that we have MyModel as an interface, we can use it liberally throughout our code. Wherever we really need the id, we can use MyModelEntity. The API gets a MyModel, which we can send to the DAO to be persisted.

The ProxyDeserializer implementation isn't too bad (and obviously is reusable across entities):

```
private val mapper = Jackson.newObjectMapper().registerModule(KotlinModule())

open class ProxyDeserializer&lt;T&gt;(private val clzz: Class&lt;T&gt;): JsonDeserializer&lt;T&gt;() {

    override fun deserialize(p0: JsonParser, p1: DeserializationContext): T {
        // convert to a json container which we can interrogate when needed
        val node = p0.readValueAs(ObjectNode::class.java)
        return Proxy.newProxyInstance(ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader(),
                arrayOf(clzz), DynamicJsonProxy(node, clzz)) as T
    }
}

class DynamicJsonProxy&lt;T&gt;(private val delegate: ObjectNode, clzz: Class&lt;T&gt;) : InvocationHandler {

    private val getters = Introspector.getBeanInfo(clzz).propertyDescriptors.map { it.readMethod }
    private val cache = CacheBuilder.newBuilder().build&lt;Method, Any&gt;()

    override fun invoke(proxy: Any, method: Method, args: Array&lt;Any&gt;?): Any? {
        // allow methods to be called multiple times without reparsing
        return cache.get(method) {
            if (method in getters) {
                val propertyName = method.name.substring(3).toLowerCase()
                // use jackson to extract this property as this return type
                return@get mapper.treeToValue(delegate.get(propertyName), method.returnType)
            } else null
        }
    }
}
```

There's various smells here that I'd appreciate ideas on improving.

a) Obviously this pushes parse errors to read time, i.e. the DAO could potentially be the ""source"" of json parsing errors, which would be confusing. That's why I wrapped the method accessors in a cache - the idea might be that there's some validation routine that runs through all getters once at the API level to do the initial parsing.

b) Using method.name.substring to dump the ""get"" from the method name isn't satisfactory. Is there a way to do that in a more elegant way?

c) I'm leaning on Java reflection rather than Kotlin. Are there more kotlin-y replacements for some of the stuff I'm doing that'd work? 

d) I also don't love the MyModelSerializer, even though it's a one liner, but I can't see any other way to get the type into the ProxyDeserializer. Is there some fancy kotlin annotation magic that'd streamline this?

I have an example scenario where I get two different response objects back from 2 different network calls. Both of them have a commonly named nested object. I want to make sure no one even can mix up the two by accident. Essentially seal them up inside of the model. I only ask because in my project, I actually have closer to 35 network calls, and all of them for some reason have a nested model of the same name, but different makeup of said nested model. Some are roughly the same, some are missing a few fields, some have more fields, some are wildly different. I want to prevent other peoples on my codebase from confusing them as I don't think they ever really need to be used.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an example of what I have now:

&amp;#x200B;

ResponseA.kt

&amp;#x200B;

`data class ResponseA(`  
 `val id: String = """",`  
 `val threads: Message = Message()`  
`) {`  
 `data class Message(`  
 `val channels: String = """",`  
 `val next: String = """"`  
 `)`  
`}`

&amp;#x200B;

ResponseB.kt

&amp;#x200B;

`data class ResponseB(`  
 `val username: String = """",`  
 `val threads: Message = Message()`  
`) {`  
 `data class Message(`  
 `val channels: Int = 0`  
 `)`  
`}`

&amp;#x200B;

I can still create objects of both, which would never need to be true as the responses come back deserialized from a library like retrofit + gson.

&amp;#x200B;

`val messageFromA = ResponseA.Message()`  
`val messageFromB = ResponseB.Message()`

317,2019-01-27 22:52:20,14,1,"So, last year I decided to learn Kotlin. Here is my little story so far:

Last year in my spare time, I was trying to design a high level programming language, and a compiler for it, targeting the old skool 8-bit 6502 CPUs as used in the Commodore-64 for instance. I was writing this in Python, but didn't like where it was going and had troubles with restructuring and refactoring the growing code base (execution speed was never an issue though).

So I switched to Kotlin to see if it would fit my project better, and to learn this promising language at the same time.

This week the first beta version of my compiler was released (if you're interested you can find it here [https://github.com/irmen/prog8](https://github.com/irmen/prog8)  documentation is here [https://prog8.readthedocs.io/](https://prog8.readthedocs.io/) )

After all the effort over the past few months in my spare time, I have to conclude that Kotlin is rather awesome. It didn't take long to learn the basics, and the refactoring hints in the IDE (I'm using IDEA) were teaching me a lot as well. As expected, restructuring and refactoring are a breeze. I like the language a lot but there are a few things that strike me as a little problematic:

* the compilation times are unexpectedly long. It takes kotlinc on my ryzen 2700x machine about 50 seconds to recompile everything into a jar. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong here.  (when using the incremental builds from within the IDE this problem is absent thankfully)
* it's awesome and unfortunate at the same time that Kotlin runs on the JVM. Integrating java code is almost trivial (and I'm using this for an antlr4 generated parser). However sometimes I ran into limitations that seem arbitrary but are caused by the JVM (such as: functions can never return more than one value, type erasure in generic collections causing issues in the kotlin type system)

I still think I could have succeeded my project with Python eventually, but switching to Kotlin was the better decision.",I used Kotlin to make a cross-compiler for 8 bit 6502 CPU machines such as the Commodore-64

 And what will happen if client's app does not uses Kotlin at all?  He will be forced to add Kotlin to his project gradle file.. We don't want this behaviour.

Furthermore what if Klient uses Kotlin 1.2.51 with experimental coroutines and I ship Kotlin with 1.3.10 with stable coroutines. Will it cause problems? I do use proguard so number of methods is not a problem for me. I just need as easy implementation as possible.

328,2019-02-12 18:09:42,47,1,"**The story:**

I work at a somewhat large organization that is primarily developing software using Java. Recently, however, we have started to look into Kotlin and have developed a couple of minor projects using it. 

In Java we have used our own coding style, it is basically the same as Intellij's auto format that comes shipped by default sprinkled with common sense. When moving to Kotlin we want to use [Kotlin's published conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html).

When we showed our Kotlin project to the rest of the team they were upset that we didn't take more of an influence from our Java conventions. This all sparked a rather heated/opinionated debate about coding styles, which is why I want to source some thoughts on the subject. In large they seem to want to have a hybrid Kotlin/Java code convention more akin to the one we're currently using with Java.

&amp;#x200B;

**The question:**

What's your thoughts/opinions? Especially I'd like to hear from people who has gone through similar change at their team/organization.

&amp;#x200B;

**My opinion:**

To make a hybrid convention I've heard these arguments:

* Quicker for Java developers to pick up and be productive with
* Look less jarring when working in hybrid projects which has some Java and some Kotlin (will be the case until projects are re-written)
* A language's coding convention is not law, it can be followed, but the team should naturally create the convention through work and experience (aka [Uncle bob](http://wiki.c2.com/?UncleBobOnCodingStandards))

&gt;These are *my* main arguments for using Kotlin's conventions:

&amp;#x200B;

* By using the standard we are making it easier for new developers to catch up on our way of coding, and when in doubt we have it written out for us. (Less opinion? Easier to find what is correct and whats not)
* In the future, when we have several projects fully developed in Kotlin, I'd rather want code that looks like Kotlin over Kotlin code that tries to look like Java
* It's the default in Intellij's code auto format for Kotlin 
* Kotlin is not Java. While Kotlin shares much with Java it is, in the end, a different language with its own syntactical sugar, which in my opinion needs its own set of styles

Neither viewpoint is objectively wrong, but I lean heavily towards renewing our code base rather than clinging to the past.

What are your thoughts? any arguments for keeping it ""Java-like"" that I have neglected?

&gt;In pure Kotlin projects, the recommended directory structure is to follow the package structure with the common root package omitted (e.g. if all the code in the project is in the ""org.example.kotlin"" package and its subpackages, files with the ""org.example.kotlin"" package should be placed directly under the source root, and files in ""org.example.kotlin.foo.bar"" should be in the ""foo/bar"" subdirectory of the source root).

So some time ago I got encouraged by this and started using this inside a project which has grown quite large as of now.

I wonder how many people apart me are using this recommendation and whether they are facing the same problems as I do, namely the refactoring problems like:

* moving files between folders inside the same module erases package prefix (`com.example.kotlin.utils` becomes `utils`). This one is *really painful*.
* broken root package detection (especially when `src/main` contains only folders, no files)
* broken Quick Fix suggestions on wrong package (again, recommending `utils`)

I thought this all stems from broken root detection, so I filed [this bug report](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-24347), which is quite old now and haven't been addressed.

I wonder is it because not many people started using this suggestion from style guide? Or there's a chance I'm doing this wrong somehow?",Do you use officially recommended directory structure for packages?

348,2019-03-08 15:07:10,3,4,"Hi everyone.  


I am working on a project in Ktor, using Exposed ORM to communicate with the MySQL Database. Currently, I am trying to write some tests, as documented [here](https://ktor.io/servers/testing.html#building-postput-bodies).   


Now while writing my first useful test, I am facing a lot of difficulties. I was wondering whether someone here could help me out or get me on the right track. There are multiple problems here, and they all seem interconnected as of now. This is a long post. I will post this to r/learnprogramming as well.   


The problems and its context:

* I have a function `fun Route.auth(dataQuerier: IDataQuerier, [Some more additional instances of classes as param, but I am leaving those out for the sake of readability])`   
which has a PUT-endpoint. This endpoint is the endpoint I want to test. This endpoint relies on `dataQuerier`, which it receives via the params of `Route.auth`
* `dataQuerier` is an instance of `class DataQuerier : IDataQuerier` , which implements `interface IDataQuerier` . This class and interface have the sole responsibility of handling all database requests. So this is the main gate for all database transactions I perform with Exposed ORM. Because of writing a test, I want this instance to be Mocked. This instance should not actually perform transactions with the database but just return dummy data and such things.
* One of the functions  defined in `IDataQuerier`, is `fun findUser(email: String) : User?` . This function returns an instance of User, which forms the Exposed ORM part of the problem. For reference, I have used [this article](https://www.baeldung.com/kotlin-exposed-persistence) to declare this object. So, this is how the class User and it's ORM equivalent look like. I am using the DAO method, which means I have `object Users` and `class User`
   *   `//Create model that represents the table in the database for Entity: User`  
`object Users : IntIdTable(""User"") {`  
 `val email: Column&lt;String&gt; = Users.varchar(""Email"", 100).uniqueIndex()`  
 `val password: Column&lt;String&gt; = Users.varchar(""Password"", 1000)`  
 `val refreshToken: Column&lt;String?&gt; = Users.varchar(""RefreshToken"", 50).nullable()`  
`}`
   * `//Enable Data Access Object (DAO) for more convenient data-transactions`  
`class User(id: EntityID&lt;Int&gt;) : Entity&lt;Int&gt;(id) {`  
 `companion object : EntityClass&lt;Int, User&gt;(Users)`  
`var email by Users.email`  
 `var password by Users.password`  
 `var refreshToken by Users.refreshToken`  
`}`  
Logically, I want the instance of `class User` to be Mocked instead of actually pulled out of the database. This is not working since I cannot manage to add the mocked instance of `DataQuerier` to `Route.auth` and prevent the code to use the un-mocked version of this instance. I am following [this example](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-samples/blob/master/app/kweet/test/KweetApplicationTest.kt) of Ktor's official documentation, where (apparently) the code is able to inject the mock directly into [their Route.Index function](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-samples/blob/master/app/kweet/src/Index.kt). It seems to work there, but isn't working for me...  
Their Route.Index function is essentially my Route.auth function. Their function is accepting an instance of `interface DAOFacade` , whereas my function is accepting an instance of `interface IDataQuerier` . 
* Based on this information, the example I linked, and my knowledge, this is my test-method I Managed to write down. I am not sure if everything is setup right, but that's why I am reaching out to you guys, anyway...

&amp;#x200B;

`val dqMock = mockk&lt;IDataQuerier&gt;()`

@Test

* `fun testSomething(){`  
`val dataToBeSentToEndpoint = LoginDC(email = ""paolo@company.com"", password = ""password"")`  
`every { dqMock.findUser(""paolo@company.com"") } returns  = User(EntityID(8, table = Users))`  
`with(engine){`  
`handleRequest (HttpMethod.Put, ""/auth/login""){`  
`addHeader(HttpHeaders.ContentType, ContentType.Application.Json.toString())`  
`setBody(jacksonObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(dataToBeSentToEndpoint))`  
`}.apply {`  
`assertEquals(HttpStatusCode.OK, response.status())`  
`}`  
`}`  
`}`  


When debugging, I do get into the code I want to test by placing breakpoints there, but it fails to grab the mocked version of the dataQuerier: It still gets the data out of the database. Ideally, I would just call Route.auth and pass the mocked object, but Ktor doesn't allow that...  


So, could someone please help me?

349,2019-03-15 15:57:39,1,1,"So recently I have been spending a lot of time in C and C++. I think my code style is probably very poor. For the most part I think that I do okay at proper memory management but admittedly there are a lot of things I know that I don't understand properly. I think a large part of that is style.

For the better part of the last decade my focus has been almost entirely in Objective-C. The more I am programming in C++ the more that I realize the differences.

I started objective-c using manual reference counting. One thing I loved about it was that in my mind it helped me understand memory management. Now that I have been working in C++, I realize I don't quite get it completely, though in general I do okay.

Some things I need some clarity on:

1. What is the rule of thumb for allocating pointers, receiving already allocated pointers, and who has the job of freeing memory when? To contrast this with what I am familiar: In Objective-C (NON\_ARC) you call retain on an object and it will stick around AT LEAST until you release it. Since there is no ""retain"" in C++, does this mean if I want to be sure the object stays around I must make a copy?
2. It seems weird to me that you can allocated objects on the stack or heap. It could be my understanding of what is going on that is the problem but in Objective-C, EVERY object is a pointer and allocated on the heap, whereas in C++ I can do it both ways and I am not sure why or what I might not understand about the reasoning behind this:

&amp;#x200B;

    Object foo = Object();
    //or
    Object *bar = new Object();

3. ​ What is the relationship between **&amp;thing** and **Thing&amp;**? Is there one? I understand that &amp;thing is getting a pointer(pointer reference?) of a stack-allocated thing, and Thing&amp; is a reference too... something. Could be a pointer, could be a primitive on the stack... could be a reference to the value in a pointer... how do you know which is which and why etc.

4. I've been doing a lot with void\*'s mostly because of low level communication stuff with BLE. I've been writing my code in a way that I think is probably not ""kosher"" but works. For example:

&amp;#x200B;

    void onWrite(BLECharacteristic* characteristic){
        if(characteristic == dataStreamCharacteristic){
            char* data = dataStreamCharacteristic.value().c_str();
            uint8_t preamble = (uint8_t)*data;
            if(preamble == kAUDIO_STREAM_PREAMBLE){
                uint8_t* 8bitAudioStream = (uint8_t*)data + 1;
                size_t streamLen = dataStreamCharacteristic.value().length() - 1;
                m_totalBytesReceived += streamLen;
                memcpy(completeAudioData + m_totalBytesReceived, 8bitAudioStream, streamLen);
            }
        }
    }

5. I notice often that what I think will happen is not what actually happens and I don't always get why. 2 examples come to mind that I don't thing are very related except that I know that I don't know what exactly is going on and why.

First Example:

(I am definitely not an android programmer but was trying to help out here) In passing data from java/kotlin to a method in the Android NDK I noticed the following:

    Java_com_socketwithc_MainActivity_stringFromJNI(JNIEnv *env, jobject /* this */, jstring pass, jbyteArray sha256) {
        (sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0));
        jboolean isCopy;
        jbyte* shaw = env-&gt;GetByteArrayElements(sha256, &amp;isCopy);// this is the JNIbyte, typedef as int8
        uint8_t realHash[32] = {0xC8 ,0xF0 ,0x15 ,0x94 ,0x78 ,0xF4 ,0x21 ,0xAF ,0x5F ,0x09 ,0x97 ,0x7D ,0x86 ,0x9A ,0x4C ,0x53 ,0x24 ,0xAB ,0xBF ,0x57 ,0x7A ,0xB3 ,0xBE ,0x77 ,0xC6 ,0x05 ,0xA4 ,0xE1 ,0x08 ,0x4D ,0x08 ,0xEC};
    
        //Here I try to send the login command with the jbyte* shaw
        bool suc = loginMobile(mobileSocks.ipv4, shaw); // This FAILS. I don't understand why? in memory
                                                         //is this not the same hex value no matter the                 
                                                        //type?
        //So I copy the values to a uint8_t array (uint8_t*)
        uint8_t copyHash[32];
    
        //copy in a slow way that ensures the values are correct...
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 32; i++){
            copyHash[i] = shaw[i];
            assert(copyHash[i] == realHash[i]);
        }
        bool suc = loginMobile(mobileSocks.ipv4, copyHash); //This SUCCEEDS, BUT it seems like the exact
                                                             //same data.
    }

Second example:

I was writing some code on the ESP32 using Arduino Core. I created a convenience method that took in a value but something was wrong with what I did:

&amp;#x200B;

    void someFunction(){
        uint32_t foo = 42;
        uint32_t bar = convenienceMethod(foo);
        Serial.println(bar); //prints something other than 0;
        someOtherWork();
        moreWork();
    }
    
    uint32_t convenienceMethod(uint32_t foo){
        Serial.println(foo); //prints something OTHER than 42.
        uint32_t foobar = foo - 42;
        return foobar;
    }

I am new to web development and wanted to ask for a feedback to my current kotlin fullstack project.

I have some javascript development experience and I already understood how fragile and difficult to maintain (compared to backend code) plain javascript can be.

Recently when KotlinJS was released i gave it a try and migrated all javascript code to kotlin. It's day and night - no more programming by trial and errors - you write it and (when compiled) it just works as expected.

The setup is very straightforward - 2 gradle modules: 

* spring boot kotlin rest backend
* kotlinj2 module that after compilation goes to backend/resources/static and gets hosted by springboot
* couple of manual tasks in gradle build

That's it - you just run gradle task 'run'. The link to the repo  [https://github.com/demoth/kotlinfullstack](https://github.com/demoth/kotlinfullstack) 

I have no experience with NPM world and react/angular frameworks and may not see obvious pitfalls of frontend development so I ask you guys for a feedback.

The setup currently lacks obfuscation and minification and not for full scale production use (at least in it's current form)

364,2019-04-04 06:23:12,16,3,"I switched from Eclipse to Intellij a few years ago; mainly for practical reasons like actually being able to import a gradle/spring boot project which over the years got more and more tedious with Eclipse. 

Last year I became a Kotlin developer as well and I love the language. But I continue to have a love hate relation ship with intellij. One thing I miss in particular is stupendously fast incremental compilation that Eclipse used to have for Java which I've never seen even approximated in intellij it's off by 10-100x even under good circumstances when it at least manages to take less than 5 seconds..

Kotlin seems to have made things worse in terms of performance. I'm now commonly faced with half to full minute delays compiling stuff after trivial 1 line changes; worse sometimes. And yes, I have incremental compilation, etc. all turned on as recommended in the countless stackoverflow articles, etc. on this topic.  It should be fast. It clearly isn't . Not even close. And it is clearly re-doing a lot of things over and over again. It looks like it really is the Kotlin compiler that is sucking up all the cpu and not other stuff like java compilation (also not fast) or moving class files around. Worse, it constantly gets it wrong as well and I'm constantly dealing with Intellij lying about whether things compile or not (both). And when it takes a minute for the red squiggly lines to even show up, things get really annoying.

The last time I tried the Kotlin plugin for Eclipse (last summer), was a complete fail. My gradle project didn't import correctly and basically nothing worked. As this was a very simple bog standard gradle/kotlin project, my conclusion was that this is not a usable IDE anymore. I just checked the github project for the kotlin plugin and it still recommends Eclipse Oxygen as the current version (it's from 2017). That does not give me a lot of confidence.

So my question is what the state is of Kotlin in other IDEs. Is Netbeans still a thing? Is there other stuff that people are using?  Just curious at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

I've made a public repository with an example for iOS framework development in Kotlin. Kotlin/Native is a fantastic technology for code sharing, which might be a better alternative than C++ someday. Currently, the multi-platform support of Kotlin/Native is still in an experimental stage, and there are only a handful of examples available for a library or framework development. Some of the configuration included in this repository was developed as part of my master's thesis. Haven't been tested in production, but it might be a useful reference for someone who's trying to achieve similar goals.

380,2019-05-07 12:05:06,8,9,"Hi there,

the lazy delegate initializes properties when accessed for the first time. This is useful when the computation of property is expensive and we do not need to access it for every instance of that class.

    class SomeClass {
        val someLazyProperty by lazy { expensiveCalculation() }
    }

In other cases we will access the property for sure, but the initialization takes time and can be done asynchronously (e.g. fetching data from a database/REST API/etc.). Afaik such delegate does not exist yet.

&amp;#x200B;

A string is a basic data type in a programming language. Strings are represented by the type \`String\`. Strings are immutable. Kotlin Strings are more or less similar to Java Strings, however Kotlin has more APIs for working with strings.

&amp;#x200B;

\#### String Basic Usage

&amp;#x200B;

\##### Declaration

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Explicit type declaration

var firstName : String = ""Elon""

&amp;#x200B;

// or Implicit type declaration and will still compile

val lastName = ""Musk""

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, notice the usage of \`val\` variable type, here is how it behaves

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

firstName = ""Mark"" // can be changed

lastName = ""Zuckerberg"" // cannot be changed

lastName = 12 // Error: type mismatch

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

\`val\` keyword indicates that the variable is read-only. Read \[Kotlin Variables\]([https://antonioleiva.com/variables-kotlin/](https://antonioleiva.com/variables-kotlin/)).

&amp;#x200B;

Kotlin has a null-safety type system, before you even compile your application, it is already giving out indications of possible nullable values.

&amp;#x200B;

For a \`String\`, here is how it can be done

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

var firstName: String? = ""Joshua""

var lastName: String = ""de Guzman""

&amp;#x200B;

firstName = null // will compile

lastName = null // will not compile

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

Notice the \`firstName\`'s type? It has an explicit type of \`String?\`, therefore it indicates that the variable is optional and can either contain a \`String\` object or a \`null\` value. Read \[Kotlin Nullability\]([https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html)).

&amp;#x200B;

\##### String Concatenation

&amp;#x200B;

Shown in the code snippet, just like Java, appending \`Int\` to

\`String\` will result to a \`String\` output

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

var str = ""abc"" + 1

println(str + ""def"")

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$ abc1def

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

Even without explicitly converting \`Int\` value 1 to \`String\` object first, the resulting output is still a \`String\`.

&amp;#x200B;

In Kotlin, you can also concatenate using \`StringBuilder\`

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

val a = ""Hello""

val b = ""World""

&amp;#x200B;

val sb = StringBuilder()

sb.append(a).append(b)

val str = sb.toString()

&amp;#x200B;

println(str)

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$ HelloWorld

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

You can also use Kotlin String Templates, which will be futher discussed \[below\](#kotlin-string-templates)

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

val a = ""Hello""

val b = ""World""

val str = ""$a $b""

&amp;#x200B;

println(str)

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$ Hello World

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

\##### String with Multiple Lines

&amp;#x200B;

Programmers can declare \`String\` variables with multiple lines by using triple quotes instead of double quotes

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

var str = """"""

This is line 1

This is line 2

This is line 3

""""""

println(str)

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$        This is line 1

$        This is line 2

$        This is line 3

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

or with \`.trimIndent()\`

&amp;#x200B;

The use of \`trimIndent()\` will additionally help to provide a clean output format by removing excess and unnecessary indentions on each line. Examine the code snippet below:

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

var str = """"""

This is line 1

This is line 2

This is line 3

"""""".trimIndent()

println(str)

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$ This is line 1

$ This is line 2

$ This is line 3

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

\#### Accessing Characters of a String

&amp;#x200B;

\##### Index Access

&amp;#x200B;

Programmers can access elements (characters) of a string using index access operator:

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

var str = ""Example""

println(str\[0\]) // first character of the string

println(str\[str.length-1\]) // last character of the string

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$ E

$ e

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

You can also retrieve characters using extension functions

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

var str = ""Example""

println(str.first()) // retrieves the first character in a string

println(str.last()) // retrieves the last character in a string

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$ E 

$ e

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

It's just like accessing an element from an array, in Kotlin Strings you can also have some \`IndexOutOfBoundsException\` when character being accessed is out of range

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

var str = ""Example""

println(str\[9\]) 

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

// Error: index out of bounds

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

You can also use \`String.get()\` in Kotlin, which is equivalent to Java's \`String.chartAt()\`

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

var str = ""Example""

var char = str.get(6)

println(char)

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$ e

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

\##### Iterate through a String

&amp;#x200B;

Elements of a \`String\` are characters that can be accessed by the indexing operation: \`s\[i\]\`

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

var str = ""Example""

for (c in str) {

println(c)

}

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$ E

$ x

$ a

$ m

$ p

$ l

$ e

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

Kotlin also allows you to use iterator's extension functions to a \`String\`, for example \`forEach\`

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

var str = ""Hello""

str.forEach { c -&gt;

println(c)

}

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$ H

$ e

$ l

$ l

$ o

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

\#### Immutability of a String

&amp;#x200B;

Just like Java, you cannot change individual elements of a \`String\`

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

var str = ""Example""

str\[2\] = ""b"" // Error

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

However you can use some operations such as \`replace()\`, if you wish to replace a specific character from a \`String\`

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

var str = ""Example""

str = str.replace(""m"", ""p"")

println(str)

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$ Exapple

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

\##### Re-assigning String values

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

var str = ""Example""

println(str)

str = ""Example was changed""

println(str)

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$ Example

$ Example was changed

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

\#### String Properties

&amp;#x200B;

\##### Determining length of a String

&amp;#x200B;

\`length\` returns the length of a character sequence

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

var str = ""Example""

println(str.length)

println(str.length - 5) // with length() function returning Int, you can do arithmetic operations just like any other Integer value

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$ 7

$ 2

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

\#### String Functions

&amp;#x200B;

These are some of the common \`String\` functions available from the current Kotlin version

&amp;#x200B;

\##### compareTo

&amp;#x200B;

Compares this object with the specified object for order. Returns zero if this object is equal to the specified other object, a negative number if it's less than other, or a positive number if it's greater than other

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

var str = ""Example""

var str2 = ""Example123""

var str3 = ""Example12345""

println(str.compareTo(str2)) // str has fewer (3) characters than str2

println(str.compareTo(str3)) // str has fewer (5) characters than str3

println(str3.compareTo(str)) // str3 has more (5) characters than str

println(str.compareTo(""Example"")) // zero denotes that the String objects being compared are equal

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$ -3

$ -5

$ 5

$ 0

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

\##### equals

&amp;#x200B;

Indicates whether a \`String\` object is exactly equal to another \`String\` object

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

var str = ""Example""

var str2 = ""Example2""

println(str.equals(""Example""))

println(str2.equals(""Example""))

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$ true

$ false

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

\##### get

&amp;#x200B;

Returns the character at the specified index in this character sequence

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\` kotlin

// Declaration

var str = ""Example""

println(str.get(3))

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$ m

\`\`\`

&amp;#x200B;

\##### toString

&amp;#x200B;

Returns a string representation of the object

&amp;#x200B;

\`\`\`kotlin

// Declaration

println(9.toString() + 10)

println(9 + 10)

&amp;#x200B;

// Output

$ ""910""

$ 19

\`\`\`

I am trying to do a simple todo list and I must declare all these adapters-style classes :   


`class NewTaskDialogFragment {`  
 `interface NewTaskDialogListener {`  
 `fun onDialogPositiveClick(dialog: DialogFragment, task: String)`  
 `fun onDialogNegativeClick(dialog: DialogFragment)`  
`}`  


`var newTaskDialogListener: NewTaskDialogListener? = null`  
`companion object {`  
 `fun newInstance(title: Int): NewTaskDialogFragment{`  
 `val newTaskDialogFragment = NewTaskDialogFragment()`  
 `val args = Bundle()`  
`args.putInt(""dialog_title"", title)`  
`newTaskDialogFragment.arguments = args`  
 `return newTaskDialogFragment`

405,2019-06-12 15:22:08,9,3,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to share this little thought.

&amp;#x200B;

let's assume you are using a  `sealed class` like this:

    sealed class Pet
    class Dog: Pet()
    class Cat: Pet()
    
    val somePet: Pet = Dog()

then `when` as an **expression**

    val name = when (somePet) {
        is Dog -&gt; ""Dog""
        is Cat -&gt; ""Cat""
    }

needs to be exhausted, whereas the **statement**

    when (somePet) {
        is Dog -&gt; println(""Dog"")
    }

does not need to be exhausted.

&amp;#x200B;

If we still want the statement to be exhaustive, there are two ways of forcing it to be exhaustive:

1. Making it an expression by storing the value in a variable, allthough not using it
2. Making it an expression by using an extension function

&amp;#x200B;

I do not like solution 1, because you have to come up with a variable name for the result which sometimes does not make any sense and you get warnings from your IDE because your are assigning a value, but actually never using it.

&amp;#x200B;

So now let's take a look how solution another solution could look like:

    when (somePet) {
        is Dog -&gt; println(""Dog"")
        is Cat -&gt; {
            // ...
        }
    }.let {} // makes it an expression and thus needs to be exhausted
    
    
    // or
    fun Any?.exhaustive() = Unit
    
    when (somePet) {
        is Dog -&gt; {}
        is Cat -&gt; {}
    }.exhaustive()
    
    
    // or
    val Any?.exhaustive get() = Unit
    
    when (somePet) {
        is Dog -&gt; {}
        is Cat -&gt; {}
    }.exhaustive

409,2019-06-15 22:30:25,9,35,"I love [Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org/), and I thought, why not to use in Web development?.

Since [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) developed Kotlin JS and has made efforts to create a good ecosystem for Web in Kotlin, developing tools such as [Create React Kotlin App](https://github.com/JetBrains/create-react-kotlin-app) and many common [Kotlin wrappers](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers) for React, React DOM, Redux, Mocha etc, why not to wrap an UI library framework for making more real Kotlin Web development?

Keeping all this in mind, I started developing a wrapper of the popular [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) framework for React and many common and useful wrappers for libraries such as [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/), [React Intl](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl) and [React Responsive](https://github.com/contra/react-responsive) making web development with Kotlin an even richer experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Since Android seens to be implementing new versions of java even more slowly than you could thought was possible, and kotlin being very tightly connected to the Android capabilities, how is Kotlin going to keep up with future Java byte code features? If Kotlin can't keep up with the new release pace of Java, it will just be out paced by Java which has an upperhand now with even quicker release pace for feature releases than most modern programming languages.","Kotlin stuck on byte code level 52 (java8), what about future features of java byte code?"

412,2019-06-18 17:22:17,1,3,"Can I use delegation in a data class constructor? I haven't been able so far. But let's recap. We are moving some of our events (lombok @Value classes) to kotlin one-line data classes, and it's easy with most of them. But in some cases we make sure we don't pass collections by reference, like in this example:

&amp;#x200B;

    @Value
    public class SomethingChangedEvent {
        Set&lt;Foo&gt; foos;
    
        public ClassWithCollection(Collection&lt;Foo&gt; foos) {

        }
    }

I tried to do a small Delegate like this one:

    class CopyOfSet&lt;T&gt;(private val value: Collection&lt;Any&gt;): ReadByCopyProperty&lt;T, Collection&lt;Any&gt;&gt; {
        override operator fun getValue(thisRef: T, property: KProperty&lt;*&gt;): Collection&lt;Any&gt; = copyOf(value);
    }

&amp;#x200B;

    data class SomethingChangedEvent (val foos: Collection&lt;Any&gt; by ReadByCopyProperty(foos))

It can generate java and kotlin classes/objects, which can be configured is several ways (visibility, package name, class name, getters/fields, etc).

434,2019-07-20 12:28:00,10,17,"Hello,

Just wanted to talk with you guys about using @Id,@GeneratedValue from JPA in kotlin language.
 
When you guys using id in kotlin do you use val or var. Also do you use nullable?

From my point of view it doesen’t make sense to have this field nullable. When I fetch data from db it doesen’t make sense that id is null. So why would someone would want to use it with safe operator? Null only make sense if I need to tell somehow to framework that this field is generated but also I can tell it to framework in different way. 
For example there can be default value 0. And that for jpa frameworks means it’s generated. But my co-worker trying to tell me that in db can be saved also id with 0. He is not wrong but also why because of this edge case use nullable field? It’s better to configure table that id starts from 1. Or maybe JPA framework can handle default value -1 in same way as 0 so it will generate it.
And what about val vs var. Ye it’s magic that jpa overrides val value but also mutable id do not make sense. 

Also mapping from entity to dto is pain. Because in business logic you want your business model to be immutable with fields thats is not nullable if it doesen’t make sense to have them null in any point of app. 

I read lots of articles but I need to know how you use it in company where you are working guys and your opinion.

451,2019-08-20 20:07:36,4,0,"the proper way of writing code in Csharp would be something like this (I assume):

`List&lt;Foo&gt; list1 = new List&lt;Foo&gt;();`

whereas in groovy one of the ways you can do it is like this:

`def list = new ArrayList&lt;Foo&gt;()`

that should be imho enough, to create type safety at compile time. Now groovy goes beyond that but then I wonder why one would not go for a modern dynamically typed language anyway.

Btw it is a misconception that dynamically typed languages do not support static typing. That is the case for php and python. Ruby didnt support static typing the last time I checked, but who uses ruby anyway nowadays?

php and python both call it type hinting afaik and it will result in run time errors

&amp;#x200B;

But: what the dynamically typed languages lack is not type safety, they do support it, but at runtime, which is kinda crap.

My question:

is there some c# flavor that guarantees type safety at compile time and but without forcing me to write everything twice?

And then I can mock like this:

    Mockito.`when`(mockedObject.myMethod(any)).then(...)

Why does this not throw an error because I pass a null value as a non-nullable parameter?

(I suspect this is because it circumvents all null-checks for the time being, for example `val a : String = any()` shows that a is null when using the debugger)

TL/DR: `val a = [3, 5, 8, 1, 2]` &lt;==&gt; `val = mutableListOf(3, 5, 8, 1, 2)`

As a former Java dev, I switched to Kotlin mostly because of the simplicity. Really, Java code is really painful to read and long compared to Python or JavaScript!

However why there are no collection literals in Kotlin while ANY OTHER modern language has this?

Sure you rarely need to create data structures by hand and mostly fetch the data from database but sometimes I need to do some simple testing / bugfixing / prototyping.

`val a = [3, 5, 8, 1, 2]` is so beautiful!

I see some people complain because it is not clear if it's an `IntArray`, `List&lt;Int&gt;` or `MutableList&lt;Int&gt;` and therefore we get a performance lost and some incompatibilities...

However you ONLY need performance if you are dealing with a live server! I mean who creates an hardcoded collection on a production server instead of fetching those data from a file/network/database?!

And `IntArray` vs `MutableList&lt;Int&gt;`:  I've develop a lot of things in Spring (Boot) and because of the good integration with Kotlin, I've never dealed with the old IntArray construct. And I think the average use case will be to use the Kotlin Collection aka List&lt;T&gt;, Map&lt;K,V&gt;, etc anyways.

So in my opinion `val a = [3, 5, 8, 1, 2]` should be translated to `val = mutableListOf(3, 5, 8, 1, 2)` to match the average use case, the amount of code and increase the developer satisfaction.",Another Call for Collection Literals

Right now I have two options:

 1. Mimick a subset of Dagger API, so probably @Binds,@Provides,@Inject,@Singleton,@Scope,@Module and @Component annotations and all related logic. 

 2. Use approach that Koin,Kodein and the like use - a kotlin DSL to build a graph, but generate factories for everything annotated with @Inject

First option seems less idiomatic for Kotlin, but it sure is familiar and battle-tested. Second would probably require more effort since I'd have to analyze graph code to check that graph is correct, but less code generation since most of the graph is built in DSL, only factories are missing.

1. I am not sure if the compiled executables will run on a system without some of the DLLs included with MinGW. I do know it might be possible to distribute the required DLLs with the executable or to compile the executable to have all of the dependency baked into the image. My problem with that is that I would like to avoid the potential technical and legal issues this might cause if done for a production tool chain for a large corporation.  

2. I am not sure if MinGW can access all of the facilities and libraries provided by Windows to MSVC. I would also like to minimize the number of translations from UNIX-like function calls to the Windows functions. This is primarily to allow easier auditing of the resulting binaries.

This doesn’t imply that Java is always the best. With the rapid transformation happening in the web and mobile application development sector, we have been witnessing the launch of new programming languages like Scala, Kotlin, Swift and Go.

### What is Kotlin?

Considering **Java** as the **go-to-language** for all Android programmers, **Kotlin** is the “**one-stop-destination**” for all application developments, both for Android and iOS. Being entirely compatible with both Java and its Java Virtual Machine version, Kotlin, sponsored by JetBrains and Google, is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference; which allows its syntax to be more concise.

### Why choose Kotlin?

Java was the programming language that the most developed Android mobile phones were using to run their local applications on their exclusive working frameworks. Although Java’s utilization is across the board, Java accompanies a ton of chronicled stuff.

    val list: List&lt;Int&gt; = listOf() // works
    
    val list: List&lt;Int&gt; = listOf().also { println(it) } // does not compile

In my opinion the compiler should be able to infer the generics of `listOf()`, since it should be able to infer `also()` first and then `listOf()`.

Any idea why the Kotlin compiler isn't able to? Would it be to complex and slow down compilation times?

&amp;#x200B;

This would come in handy in an example like the following:

    class Person(val firstName: String, val lastName: String)

    persons.sortedWith(compareByDescending&lt;Person&gt; { it.lastName }.thenBy { it.firstName })
    
    // better, but does not compile:

I've been reading this article which I'm sure must be telling me what I need to know but I just can't join all the dots and use it solve what I'm trying to do which I'm sure is ridiculously simple to most of you:

[https://www.i-programmer.info/programming/android/11806-android-programming-in-kotlin-events.html](https://www.i-programmer.info/programming/android/11806-android-programming-in-kotlin-events.html)

I'm going to strip away my pathetic failed attempts and hopefully find clarity through using a very basic example:

Let's say I have a class for a car:

    class Car {
        fun onRedTrafficLightSpotted() {
            //make car stop
        }
    }

Then a second class for a traffic light:

    class TrafficLight {
        fun eventTrafficLightGoesRed() {
            //when this is called it'll launch the onRedTrafficLightSpotted function within the 
            //car class, which is listening out for this event. So causing all cars to react to 
            //any single red traffic light going red.
        }
    }

So there'd be a bunch of instances of traffic lights and cars. When one traffic light goes red, all the cars will react by running the spotted function. A silly example but trying to keep it as simple as possible. Previously I'd be passing an array of cars in to each traffic light, storing it there then calling the relevant function on the cars from within the traffic light class. So this whole event/listener solution seems far more appropriate and elegant unless I'm totally missing something?

I'm just so befuddled trying to  take the next step to understand how this then gets set up. I'd be immensely grateful if someone can show me how this simple example would be coded. I've read through that linked article several times but I feel so clumsy implement how I think this should be set up but failing.

Please someone show mercy on an exhausted learner.

I develop the ""client"", the part that runs in the browser, using a major JS/TS framework such as React, Vue, Angular (I use Vue) with a UI library that gives me many premade components (eg Vuetify).

Hey all,

Sorry if this has been asked before and I hope its the correct sub but I'm struggling to find the answer...

I'm a xamarin /xamarin forms developer and have been for about 4 years. I am about to start a 7 month project to replatform to swift and kotlin (finally).  I am pretty up to date with swift and iOS mobile platform itself (to be fair was pretty easy swap from xamarin). The only thing I don't really understand still is if swift UI or storyboards is the way to go. I think this probably stems from me being so used to hacking around everything in xamarin I don't know what nice app development looks like :D.

My app is a reasonably sized and used production app (300k month users) and it's supported by a pretty customised rest api that takes care of MOST of my business logic. Therefore the current xamarin app and the new swift app are pretty lightweight front ends and the app is mainly there for cool iOS specific features. Included in the app are thing like error logging, tagging, push notifcations and many 3rd party libraries used for all different manner of things. It's also very important that unit testing is done to a sufficent level as code quality is a real driving force for this new app (xamarin is a buggy mess at times and really hard to test). ( and ofc UI tests)

With all that in mind is Swift UI something that would be viable or is it worth just going back and using storyboards and VCs? I have had exposure to both and I actually think swfit UI works pretty well and correct me if im wrong but apple seem to be pushing it going forwards? (its even the default when you create a new app in xcode).

I understand that kotlin is big on Android, but we won't be using it for that at all. It will basically be a big server farm and probably a few web pages to administer it. I understand that kotlin can run native via LLVM, but I read that performance there is not very good. Hopefully that improves.

Any opinions?",Is kotlin good for microservices?

The -util library is utilities for a few nice things

https://github.com/mercenary-creators/mercenary-creators-kotlin-util


It has a decent AES 256 CBC and GCM crypto package. It does binary, text, and files/streams/URL’s etc, and is very fast. I recreated the CypherOutputStream from scratch for high performance.

It has something much like Spring Resources but doesn’t drag in the whole Spring stack, file, url, classpath resources and resource lookup. Also building on javax.activation Mime Type matching.

It has YET ANOTHER TIME DURATION implementation, and I know that has been done to death but I needed it in a non experimental implementation. It can do duration and date mathematics, Date() + 4.75.weeks - ( 1.year / 2 )

The json package 

https://github.com/mercenary-creators/mercenary-creators-kotlin-json

Mostly utility code for JSON types and Kotlin extensions with reiified inline methods. I had an earlier version of this before FasterXML put out the Kotlin module. It used to have serializers and deserializers for Kotlin Sequences, but I submitted a ticket to the FasterXML team and they added that in the latest 2.10.1 release.

It has a set of Kotlin extensions for the jayway JsonPath library.

I also added the basic data classes for the typicode JSON REST services. This is useful for testing 

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

https://github.com/mercenary-creators/mercenary-creators-kotlin-mail

This is a full implementation of the Java Mail API as a Mail DSL. Can do plain text, html, mime with attachments or inline attachments. Uses reactive scheduling, working on a coroutines version.

C# is a good language and .NET as a platform has been getting better and better, but I'm not happy with the C# language design direction. They seem to keep wanting to solve problems by adding new language features. I would group C# with C++, JavaScript, and Scala in this regard. Even if a feature is a good thing, it doesn't necessarily mean its a good fit.

I personally prefer the approach of languages like Go, Elm, and Elixir who are slower to add features and instead focus on simplicity. Go, for example, doesn't try to be the best systems language AND the best UI language. Elm doesn't focus on anything except on web apps. I really like that concept. Instead of spending time choosing one of many frameworks, design patterns, linters or formatters, I can focus on the {insert language} way of solving the problem.

To my question... Where does Kotlin fit in this spectrum? I've heard a lot of good things about the language. Does JetBrains focus on ""adding great new features"" or ""carefully designing a language for the long-term?""

I see JetBrains describing the language as ""concise"" (something I like) and ""[Keeping the Language Modern](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/evolution/kotlin-evolution.html)"" (fine as long as keeping it modern doesn't mean adopting every new/popular concept).",How conservative or progressive is Kotlin's language design?

If you want to work for Google (or at least for its parent company,  Alphabet), it will help if you can code in one of four key programming  languages. They're all pretty mainstream.

In the chart below we've plotted the percentage of currently  advertised jobs at Alphabet against the percentage of staff currently  claiming to work there who mention each language on their public  profiles. It turns out most Googlers are all about Python, Javascript,  C++ and Java. 

This should not come as a surprise. GitHub's recent State of the  Octoverse report had Javascript, Python and Java as the top three  programming languages, with C++ ranking 6th.

As with most employers, Alphabet's demand for programming languages  isn't restricted to each language individually: it typically asks for a  cluster of several when it advertises roles - the chart measures the  percentage of roles/profiles specifying a programming language that  include each one.  

The programming language that Alphabet doesn't use much - surprisingly perhaps - is [Kotlin](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/3000996/kotlin-banking-jobs),  which Google made its preferred language for Android app development in  May. There are a handful of Kotlin jobs on offer, but not many - and  less than 0.5% of the total. Nor is Go as popular as might be expected  given Google's suggestion seven years ago that it might be a good  replacement for the[ C languages. ](https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article#TOC_1)

Alphabet hires C++ developers as Google cloud engineers, network and  system specialists, security experts and database engineers. Investment  banks, hedge funds and high frequency trading funds are also big users  of [C++ expertise in high speed trading systems. ](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/137065/the-six-hottest-programming-languages-to-know-in-banking-technology)

Based on our current snapshot, the thing that seems to be growing in  use at Google is .NET. The platform feaures in a far higher proportion  of current job ads than on the profiles of existing staff. This is a  curiosity given Google's historic rivalry with Microsoft. However, .NET  can be used with Kubernetes, Google's open source system for automating  the deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications,  and is used in the fast-growing [Google Cloud business,](https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/3000762/google-cloud-jobs-financial-services) so this shouldn't be massively startling either.

## Top 5 Kotlin server-side frameworks-

### 1. Javalin-

 

Basically, Javalin is just a few thousand lines of code over Jetty. It began as a fork of the Java and also Kotlin web framework Spark, which immediately turned into a ground- up rewrite influenced by the Javascript framework koa.js. Since the first release, A new version is released two times per month (overall), where each non-major version is backward compatible.

#### Advantages-

* It centers around completing things rapidly. In some cases this doesn’t feel like an advantage
* Simple to use
* Embedded Jetty server
* Lightweight and fast, especially compared to other counterparts here.
* Lambda- based WebSocket API
* Real micro- framework

#### Limitations-

* Documentation is not a great. While suitable for someone with a prior Javalin knowledge; it simply not good for someone who simply needs to learn from scratch. 
* Not sticking to standard terminology. For instance, what is normally known as Routes and Filters are combined together as Handlers. Which makes it harder when you read outsider tutorials and people keep referring to it as routes or filters.
* Not develop enough; their feature to-do list is still excessively long. To battle this you should depend on outsider dependencies and that is an extremely profound gap. 

### 2. KTor-

 

Ktor is a framework for rapidly making web applications in Kotlin with minimal effort. It is very light and don’t impose any constraints on what underlying technology a project is going to use. What makes it stand up is that it’s created by the Kotlin team. 

#### Advantages–

* Reliable and stable
* Small memory footprint and lightweight
* Fast but competition is faster (like Javalin and http4d)
* Perfect for prototyping
* Real micro-framework

#### Limitations-

* Experiences a similar issue as Javalin. If you have to make anything complex you should incline toward third-party libraries.
* If you do not know what are you doing then documentation is going to be confusing as hell.
* Not mature enough
* Small community

### 3. Spark-

 

Spark is the typical suspect with regards to micro-services. It’s one of the oldest expressive Kotlin/ Java web framework built for rapid development, you can even consider it a higher level of Kotlin frameworks. Really awful the support is still in the alpha version.

#### Advantages-

* Small memory footprint
* Fast and also a lightweight
* Excellent for rapid prototyping
* Easy to setup
* Plays well with Angular
* Real micro-framework
* Embedded Jetty server

#### Limitations-

* Documentation could be better, it is not intended for beginners.
* Not appropriate for large projects. 

### 4. Spring Boot-

 

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand- alone, production- grade Spring based Applications that you can “just run”.

#### Advantages-

* Can create stand- alone spring applications
* Easy to setup and handle
* Spring family environment
* Modular
* Plays well with other libraries
* Large community (very popular)
* Enterprise-ready

#### Limitations-

* Documentation fragmentation. Too many sources, too many versions, too many differences. Make sure you know which version you are going to use.
* Breaking changes between versions. If you hate what Angular is doing you will also hate it here.
* Confusing documentation. 

### 5. Vert.x-

 

Vert.x is a tool- kit for building reactive applications in a different programming language, like Java and Kotlin. This tool (kit) is powerful, however, it is not for everyone. Keep reading and you will find why.

#### Advantages-

* Fast
* Small memory footprint – Comparable to Spark
* WebSockets support
* Reactive systems approach. The idea is to have more flexible, loosely-coupled and scalable applications.
* Vert.x offers a complete ecosystem
* Highly modular

#### Limitations-

* It’s not for everybody. As a reactive toolkit, it fills a different niche compared to other frameworks here. 
* Not a solution for you if the Spring Boot is your framework of choice. Before you try it make sure you know what are you getting into.

## Conclusion-

Just like with Java, this comparison is a fight between well- established all-around frameworks and their more lean micro-service counterparts.

[Git Repo](https://gitlab.com/AnimusDesign/kotlin-frm)

[Documentation](https://animusdesign.gitlab.io/kotlin-frm)

[Artifacts](https://nexus.animus.design/#browse/browse:AnimusDesignSnapshot:design%2Fanimus)

This is an early alpha access, and a lot of work still needs to be done. It's akin
to [Jooq](https://www.jooq.org/). But not tied to JDBC, and is multi platform. **Right now it is strictly Postgres and JaSync JVM.** More databases, and executors, will be coming soon.

I'm looking for feedback and input on the API, gradle plugin, etc.

**It is broken into three layers.**

* *Schema* provides a gradle plugin to reflect your data base, and generate the types. It will generate multi platform representation of your database, or a single platform. Configurable in the build plugin.
* *Query* Uses the generated types to build out a query.
* *Executor* Provides a means to execute the query. Right now it's utilizing `JaSync`, but more can easily be added.

#### How is it Multi Platform?

The schema gradle plugin generates types for multiple platforms, or a single platform. Using the query builder it builds a generic query representation that is passed into the executor.

The executor adheres to an interface and is not tied into a platform. While it starts with `JaSync` on the `JVM`. Other executors can be added on any platform.

So while this is primarily JVM right now, it was built to be extensible to other platforms.

#### Core Features

* Schema First, generates types off your schema via a build (*gradle plugin*)
* Multi platform support for js, jvm, native
    * Support for multiple Executor i.e. JDBC and JaSync, Node Postgres, etc.
* DSL that maps closely to SQL. 
* Functional builder methods that map closely to collection methods.
* Support for advanced aggregation methods on different databases
    * *json_agg*
* Functional Wrappers
    * Executors that return types instead of exceptions
    * [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io) Wrapper
* Can operate as a type safe string builder
* Support for kotlin features
    * Suspend non-blocking connections
    * Multi column primary keys (*Pair, Triple*) *Coming Soon* 
* Generation of common SQL operations *Coming Soon*
    * Get by ID
    * update by id
    * etc.
* SQL, for now more data bases coming soon. *Cassandra is my next focus*
* Compiled queries
    * Don't waste cycles using the DSL, have the query as a string ready for the connection layer.
    * Pre build join or aggregate function data classes.
* Designed with Flyway in mind for ease of migrations.


#### Code Sample

**SQL DSL**

```kotlin
selectJ(Users.id, Users.firstName, Users.lastName, jsonAgg {
    jsonObj {
        ""orderPlaced"" to UserOrders.orderPlaced
        ""inventory"" to jsonObj {
            ""id"" to Inventory.id
            ""name"" to Inventory.item
            ""price"" to Inventory.price
        }
    }
}) from Users join UserOrders on {
    UserOrders.userId equal Users.id
} join Inventory on {
    Inventory.id equal UserOrders.inventoryId
} groupBy listOf(
        Users.id, Users.firstName, Users.lastName
)
```
**Functional**

```
 Users
    .withColumns(Users.id, Users.firstName, Users.lastName, UserProfile.email)
    .join(UserProfile) {
        UserProfile.id equal Users.id
    }
    .filter { Users.firstName iLike ""%ja%"" }
    .mapInto(executor, UserProfileJoinRecord::class) {
        val sorted = it.sortedBy { item -&gt; item.id }
        assertTrue { sorted[0].id == 1 &amp;&amp; sorted[0].email == ""jdoe@google.com"" }
        assertTrue { sorted[1].id == 2 &amp;&amp; sorted[1].email == ""jsmith@google.com"" }
        assertTrue { sorted[2].id == 4 &amp;&amp; sorted[2].email == ""jblack@hotmail.com"" }
    }
```

The file generated was not java compatible (I know it's decompiled to java and not Kotlin).
But, AFAIK : 

1. [Kotlin compiles to 
 java compatible bytecode](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/faq.html#what-does-kotlin-compile-down-to)   and
2. JVM doesn't know anything about the programming language making it easier for other languages to target JVM.

If above points hold then the `.class` file should have decompiled to syntactically correct `.java` file but, it didn't. I'm not sure why.

I'm unable to find any official source which can clarify this but according to a a bit old stackoverflow link(didn't save it earlier and unable to find it now), Kotlin uses some bytecode tricks which might not result in Java compatible code.

I am trying to learn Kotlin/Native with Gradle ─I'm new to both, Native and Gradle, but no Kotlin itself ─, but I am having a rough time including Java libraries (standard ones). I can do a simple *Hello, World!* in Native, but as soon as I try to import, for example, `import java.io.File` I got on `gradle build`:

```gradle
&gt; Task :compileKotlinNative FAILED
e: /.../src/nativeMain/kotlin/Main.kt: (1, 8): Unresolved reference: java
```

My `build.gradle.kts` is as simple as:

```gradle
plugins {
    kotlin(""multiplatform"") version ""1.3.61""
    application
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile(""org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:1.3.61"")

kotlin {

		binaries {
			executable()

tasks.withType&lt;Wrapper&gt; {
  gradleVersion = ""6.0.1""
  distributionType = Wrapper.DistributionType.ALL
}

application {
    mainClassName = ""MainKt""
}
```

It's pretty much what JetBrains mark as necessary to build a Native application.

It works if I change `""multiplatform""` to `""jvm""` and take out the `kotlin {}` block, but obviously the build stops being native; or if I simply comment the import, but I will need it eventually. Since what I want is simply understand and test the concepts, the code in `Main.kt` for now is as simple as:

```
import java.io.File //this would be the conflicting line

fun main() {
    println(""Hello, there"")
}

557,2020-01-05 18:38:38,9,1,"Hello. A little new to Kotlin, with some familarity in java.

As a learning exercise, I am trying to convert a Java library to Kotlin. (If it matters, I am talking about algs4 from Sedgewick and Wayne companion site to algorithms 4ty edition).

I am trying to convert a static class to a bunch of standalone functions.
Now, what is the proper way to do it?
I understand, that I could just create kotlin class and call all the static methods with companion object, however I am curious what is the ""right"" way to do it.
1. Create an object, with the same name as the static class object and put everything inside of it? 
2. Just write standalone functions together with global objects?
3. Do it as it was done in java - a static class (companion object + JvmStatic).

Also, there is a static block in the static class I am trying to convert. If I understand correctly, the cose inside of static block should be put inside of init function in (companion) object.
However, what is the alternative to static block (I mean static{ somecode }) in java if my code is not inside of an object or a class?

Thanks.

&lt;tl;dr&gt; Highlighted the actual question because lots of context blabla

I have a master degree in computer science and and been working with Java in the past 7 years.  
I recently decided to get into Kotlin and am currently working my way through their code examples.

I'm currently looking into **Extension Functions and Properties**, which conceptually I understand. I also understand the provided code example, though I don't quite get some of the **syntax**.

Heres a link to the tutorial section:  [https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample/04\_functional/03\_extensionFunctions](https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample/04_functional/03_extensionFunctions) 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm referring to these lines of code:

`fun Order.maxPricedItemValue(): Float = this.items.maxBy { it.price }?.price ?: 0F`  
`fun Order.maxPricedItemName() = this.items.maxBy { it.price }?.name ?: ""NO_PRODUCTS""`

Specifically, **the part after curly brackets are closed**.

From my understanding now, I define the extension functions as calling a maxBy() function from Collection, using lambda `{it.price}` to define which parameter to sort by and then I'm not sure any more.

At first, this reminded me of ternary operations, but they don't exist in Kotlin.  
Then I recalled that `?` is used to mark nullable objects, so I guess if the Collection doesn't contain any entries or for whatever reason can't find the max priced Item, it returns null. Then I try to call price / name from the nullable result of maxBy? Sounds plausible, but again, not sure. And how `?:` works in the end is beyond me.

I mean, I understand that the first function returns the price of the highest priced item or zero (float) if there is none, and the second returns the name or ""NO\_PRODUCTS"" if there are none. But I deduct that from context, **not** from **understanding the syntax**.",Beginner Question regarding Tutorial-Code

i want to define protected constant with Kotlin but i am stuck. Using of companion object and object seems like over kill to me. Unnecessary object creation , getter and setter. I know I can use const or @ JvmField for get rid of getter and setter but Object creation still is there.

 When I put constant value to top level, I can""t use protected visibility and Kotlin generate another public final class for just one constant. So how can i define protected constant? Is there any optimization for companion object when i use with  const or @ JvmField because when i inspect bytecode just see unused companion object. Will the jit optimize companion object.

 [https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html) 

and begin reading.

I don't really understand but read up until I reach the code:

`fun &lt;T, R&gt; Collection&lt;T&gt;.fold(`

`initial: R,` 

`combine: (acc: R, nextElement: T) -&gt; R`

`): R {`

`var accumulator: R = initial`

`for (element: T in this) {`

`accumulator = combine(accumulator, element)`

`}`

`return accumulator`

`}`

Now I am really lost.

I don't know what these mean &lt;&gt;, they normally come with something inside, I have seen ArrayList&lt;String&gt; for example in java so maybe it means type?

I don't know what &lt;T,R&gt; means, I don't know what Collection&lt;T&gt;.fold is and so on.

583,2020-02-04 03:17:03,6,1,"I have a doubt that even after a long time of studying coroutines, I never managed to understand it in a simple way. The doubt is about suspending functions and how they relate to threads and coroutines.

If we define a function like this 

    suspend fun wait() { // some suspending code here }

From what I understand, this function definition does not create new threads, nor coroutines. It's only meant to signal to the compiler that this function might suspend, so it should only be called from a suspendable context.

But if we declare it like this instead:

    suspend fun waitOnContext() = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        // some suspending code here
    }

I believe (and correct if I'm wrong) that three things happens when a function defined like this is called:

1. Since the function is suspending (not blocking), the caller thread is free to do whaterver else it needs to do.
2. The sequential execution flow stops, meaning that the code after the function will only run after it completes, like a callback.
3. A new thread is created so that the code runs in the background.

How do the environment (I don't know which name to use here) decides what to do next with the caller thread? Does it uses an event loop, OS scheduling facilities or maybe the compiler organizes the code in such a way so that other things can be done while the new thread is running on the background.

One simple example is the Android main thread: How does the environment knows that it needs to run view rendering and gesture handling code after the new thread is created? And how does it knows to come back to the rest of the coroutine once the background thread finishes?

Another doubt that I have is if `CoroutineScope` is meant to group related coroutines so that they doesn't leak or if it's just meant to represent parent-child relationships so that when `Job` is cancelled, all of the children coroutines are cancelled as well.

One thing that made me confused was [this example](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/basics.html#scope-builder) from the Kotlin documentation. In it one `coroutineScope` is defined that suspends while waiting for a child coroutines to finish. Does this happen because the `CoroutineScope` needs to wait for all children coroutines to finish so it can be finished as well?

Am I correct in assuming that a `CoroutineScope` works similarly to a function scope in the sense that while a function needs to clear its local variables once it finishes, a `CoroutineScope` needs to clear it's children coroutines by waiting for them?

Another similarity is that when an exception happens inside a function, it has to clear all its local variables (stack unwinding), while a `CoroutineScope` needs to clear all it's coroutines by canceling them.

591,2020-02-14 08:41:14,1,1," 

Google has recently replaced Java with Kotlin for Android development. As a result, all Android developers must learn Kotlin to develop applications for Android Smartphone devices. At this point, many people may think that learning Java is no more required. In reality, Kotlin is an improved version of Java. It uses its library. It further comes with most of the features and options.

**Kotlin vs. Java - Conciseness**

When it comes to comparing the conciseness factor, Kotlin has been noted as more concise. Writing the Java codes take space and time because it needs a boil plate code. For example, public static void main (String \[\] args){} ) code which consumes space and time. The same cannot be said in the case of Kotlin. Writing Kotlin codes is easier and it takes lesser space. It is a contemporary and improvised version of Java. It does not need a boilerplate code. Hence, it is expected to be more compact compared to the Java programming language. Also, it is more expressive, clean and powerful.

**Comparing the Safety Aspect**

Now, it is time to compare the safety aspects. Which one among Java and Kotlin can be regarded as safer? Since Kotlin is a contemporary coding language, it comes with better safety features. It makes your algorithm safer, as it knows the contemporary challenges. [Read More](https://www.apsmind.com/apsmind/blog/java-vs-kotlin-comparision.html)",Java vs Kotlin - comparison
592,2020-02-16 15:42:21,11,1,"Hi,

I have a hard time understanding coroutines and channels.

I have the following szenario:
1. I want to read some URLs from a database
2. I want to download the content from these URLs
3. I want to store the content in a database

So I thought kotlin channels would be the right way to implement this pipeline. Read the URLs from the database, downlaod them parallel and store them as soon as they are downloaded.

However, I have the problem that only two downloads are started at a time.

So I wrote this short example to understand what's happening:

```
fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) {
    val context = newFixedThreadPoolContext(5, ""TEST"")
    runBlocking(context) {
        produce {  // 1. read from database
            for (i in 1..5) {
                send(i)
            }
        }
        .map {  // 2. download content
            async {
                println(""$it downloading"")
                delay(5000)
                it
            }
        }
        .consumeEach{  // 3. store to database
            val content = it.await()
            println(""$content consumed"")
        }
    }
}
```

with the Output

```
1 downloading
2 downloading
1 consumed
2 consumed
4 downloading
3 downloading
3 consumed
4 consumed
5 downloading
5 consumed
```

So why are there two downloads running at a time. I thought with the context of 5 Threads it would start all 5 downloads.",understanding coroutines / channels

This is much easier than the Java equivalent. A lot of math operations now also have a cleaner API.

What I'm hoping to get is feedback on the extensions, also how Kotlinized the example code is, and other suggestions for improving Kotlin integration (besides rewriting everything in Kotlin). I know the extensions are poorly documented at the moment and that's because they are a sketch.

                mBLEService = null
            }
        }
    
        fun initBLEService(context: Context) {
            try {
                if (mBLEService == null) {
                    val gattServiceIntent = Intent(context, BLEService::class.java)
                    if (context != null) {
                        isBind = context.bindService(gattServiceIntent, mServiceConnection,
                            Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE)
                        Log.i(TAG, ""BLEConnectionManager.initBLEService isBind = $isBind"")

            if (mBLEService != null) result = mBLEService!!.connect(deviceAddress)
            return result
        }

    if (!BLEDeviceManager.isEnabled()) {
 val enableBtIntent = Intent(BluetoothAdapter.ACTION_REQUEST_ENABLE)
    startActivityForResult(enableBtIntent, REQUEST_ENABLE_BT)
}
BLEConnectionManager.initBLEService(this@MainActivity)

The BLEService class is unchanged from the [original code](https://github.com/Nithinjith/LEKotlin-Android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/np/lekotlin/blemodule/BLEService.kt).

When I run it, `$mBLEService` is null in `connect`, and I note that when `initBLEService` is called, `$isBind` is always null too. I therefore think I don't properly understand the mechanics of how services work and what they do in this instance. So, why am I unable to bind the service, and is the binding problem the cause of the service being null?",Anyone know why I'm unable to bind to my service in this code?

621,2020-03-28 18:04:49,6,1,"This might be a silly question, but sometimes when working with android and calling methods that are already written using Java in my `.kt` class, intellij will give an error that I should use either the safe calls(?.) or the npe lover operator (!!). Now I understand both, already read the docs:

[https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html)

But what I dont understand, how should we know when to use `?.` when calling java code? Now intellij will give me an error which is great! According to what I read if a method contains the annotation `@Nullable` it means it can be null then we have to use `""?.""`

&amp;#x200B;

Also my second question, is that sometimes we are forced to use !! instead of ?., why is that?

For example, if I am inside a fragment (inside `onViewCreated()`), and i call `findNavController:`

`val navController : NavController = activity!!.findNavController(R.id.navhostfragment)`

I have to use `!!` instead of `?.` I can do this:

`val navController : NavController? = activity?.findNavController(R.id.navhostfragment)` but then later on I get an error when calling `setupWithNavController()` since it doesnt have an argument of type `NavController?`",Null Safety
622,2020-03-29 15:35:50,8,1,"Given any list of values which all add up to 100, does Kotlin provide any built in functions or methods which could determine if any of the percentages are below a minimum threshold, and if so, increase it as well as decreasing the other values, all while maintaining a sum of 100?

For example, given the list of (50, 25, 5, 5, 15), and given that 5 is below our threshold, is there a way to increment each value of 5 to 6, and to decrement any other value(s) so that we maintain our 100 percent sum? In this example, one possible result array would be (50, 24, 6, 6, 14).

Using Java, I know this can be done (pretty inefficiently), by looping through the list and finding any value less than or equal to 5 and keeping track of the number of instances found. Then the list would be iterated though again, this time subtracting the number of instances from one or more values, and incrementing the under threshold value(s)",Is there a more efficient way in kotlin to resize a list of percentages and still have them add up to 100?
623,2020-03-29 22:50:55,11,1,"I'm trying to find a blog post that I remember enjoying. My memory is fuzzy, but the big picture was that this person implement some kind of database/domain model as a class with a nullable ""id"" field. Like this:

    /* data ? */ class Person(var id: Int?, val name: String, val age: Int)

And then he and a coworker ""hated"" each other for their differing opinions. The other coworker thought they should have a `Person` without an `id` and a `SavedPerson` that has an `id`, but the classes are almost identical, and it would require lots of `to` and `from` code, so the author hated that.

He came up with some pretty elegant solution, but I don't remember what it was. It might have been interface + inner classes + delegation or maybe a sealed class with interfaces and delegation. I don't remember.

Anybody else remember this or have any idea what I'm talking about? Thanks in advance.

624,2020-03-30 18:37:11,0,1,"I was excited when u/ArkadiiIvanov posted about the [MVIKotlin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/fjjupo/mvikotlin_new_kotlin_multiplatform_framework_for/) project a few weeks ago.

Kicked the tires on the project and I was overall impressed.

Majority of my experience is as a Kotlin Android developer, but I write about 30% of my code for Swift iOS. Putting up what is essentially the same PR for business logic on two platforms is frustrating. MVIKotlin seems like a great initiative to solve duplicate code.

I jumped into the deep end of the pool as I'm fresh when it comes to Kotlin multiplatform, RX, and SwiftUI. Lots to learn.

Two initial takeaways:

1. Sharing code across multiple platforms likely benefits from a strict architecture, especially for a complex project. *Curious to see how quickly new developers can pickup the framework* (like myself). I set up the samples and learned about Stores in under an hour. Next steps would be to understand Views and Binding.
2. Building the iOS libraries took from scratch took 16 minutes on my underpowered Macbook. *Curious how build times play into a normal development cycle for iOS*. I'd like to play around with incremental updates further ( u/ArkadiiIvanov mentioned the first build is slow).

Like most people, I am using kotlin in android studio, and it keeps telling me that the semicolon is redundant, by greying it out and even underlining it.

Now I don't mind that it's redundant, but I do work in languages where semicolon IS enforced (fx Flutter/Dart), so I'm not about to change my habits.

Instead, I'd love to just suppress the warning. Is there anyway to do that?",Suppress redundant semicolon warning

I've been struggling to create a good 'kotlin-for-all' project, with a KTOR server and and a kotlin/JS client, that runs nicely in IntelliJ

&amp;#x200B;

I've used the Kotlin Project template 'JS Client and JVM Server' which gets me a working project, but I can't seem dynamically recompile the Javascript. I'm not even sure where the JS is coming from - presumably the assembled JS jar? If I make a change to the Kotlin JS, do I have to stop the server, re-assemble the JS JAR, and restart?

&amp;#x200B;

I've managed to get dynamic JS recompilation working in a project at work but only with a small raft of hacks held together with string and sticky tape - what I want is a standardized, JetBrains-approved, non-hacky, clear way of accomplishing this goal.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone give me a hint on how to proceed?",Working with KTOR and multi-platform projects in IntelliJ

632,2020-04-07 16:48:03,0,1,"I'm developing a Kotlin/Native library for both iOS and Android. 

When running ./gradlew assemble I get the release/debug .frameworks with Obj-C Headers.

I can use these .frameworks fine. But I would also like to carry on with documentation of classes and functions when using the code on XCode.

If I use KDoc and document my code:

    /**
     * This is a comment about the class I developed.
     * [BaseService] is a class.
     */
    class BaseService {
    
        /**
         * Comments about this val
         */
        val greeting = ""Hello""
    
        /**
         * This function greets the user
         */
        fun greetUser(){
            println(greeting)
        }
    
    }

All of this is lost when bringing it to my iOS project. Because the .framework don't carry the KDocs with it.

  
Is there any way to carry the documentation over to the Obj-C Headers or other auxiliary files when assembling the .framework files? Maybe some Gradle configuration I am missing?  


I also asked on StackOverflow. Maybe someone in can grab it:

From [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47884934/im-getting-overload-resolution-ambiguity-error-on-kotlin-safe-call) I think this might be due to smart casting. But if that is the case, why is it only happening inside the if block (line: 42) and not outside (line: 39)?

I find that now when I write Java I make lots of dumb mistakes like forgetting semicolons or the `new` keyword. Previously Java was my go-to interview language but given how little I write it I think these small mistakes would give a poor impression if I continued to use it during coding live challenges. 

Does anyone have experience going on the interview circuit using Kotlin for these challenges? How was that received? I'm a huge fan of the language but I recognize that many companies have outdated views on it, perhaps thinking of it as an exclusively Android tool (I'm a backend dev). Were companies generally receptive or did they raise eyebrows when you would use it? 

The other option I am thinking is investing time learning more Python. That is a nice interviewing language in general and the syntax is different enough that I think I can effectively switch from ""kotlin-mode"" to ""python-mode"" without too much fuss. The downside is that I don't have nearly as much experience in this language.",Coding interviews in Kotlin?

Kotlin:
```kotlin
val result = if (x &lt; 5) true else false
```

Rust:
```rust
let result = if x &lt; 5 { true } else { false };
```

This is, in my opinion, better. There are many mistakes that are made by forgetting braces for `if`, for example [Apple's goto fail](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/02/24/anatomy-of-a-goto-fail-apples-ssl-bug-explained-plus-an-unofficial-patch/).
```Kotlin:
if (x &lt; 5)
    do_something_1()
    do_something_2()
```
In the example above, `do_something_2()` will be always executed, even though someone might think it's part of the `if` because of the indentation.

Now, I don't want to make a breaking change the core of the language, of course. However, I think that an addition of a braces-mandatory `if` (which would be used by not adding parentheses around the `if` condition) could be a nice addition to the language.

It runs, great. It constructs the command, it registers it fine, it even executes it fine. But here's the issue: I have no access to that constructed instance to change the arguments.

In the context of `command.get(split[0])?.run { }`, `this` is a `KFunction&lt;IHasRegistry&gt;`. I have access to the type the function returns, the argument types it takes, but I have no access to the actual instance.

655,2020-04-25 19:14:14,0,1,"In our crypto-currency exchange we pretty often use a multicasting when we broadcast messages from the server-side to our clients.

As an example, our gateway listens to a kernel which sends us all the information we need, but that information is streamed in one stream regardless of a trader it belongs to. So we listen to it, separate on different streams and broadcast them to our clients - such a process is called a multicasting.

For the sake of simplicity we moved all the multicast logic into a standalone class called `Multicast`. And here it is:

    class Multicast&lt;in ReqT, RespT&gt;(
        private val meterRegistry: MeterRegistry,
        private val callerClassName: String,
        private val numberOfCachedItemsAtStart: Int = 0,
        private val subscribe: (ReqT) -&gt; Flux&lt;RespT&gt;
    ) {
    
        private val subscriptions = ConcurrentHashMap&lt;ReqT, FluxProcessor&lt;RespT, RespT&gt;&gt;()
    
        init {
            addMeter(""multicast_total_upstreams"") { totalUpstreams().toDouble() }
            addMeter(""multicast_active_upstreams"") { activeUpstreams().toDouble() }
        }
    
        private fun addMeter(name: String, function: (Multicast&lt;ReqT, RespT&gt;) -&gt; Double) {
            meterRegistry.gauge(name, Tags.of(""caller_class"", callerClassName), this, function)
        }
    
        operator fun invoke(request: ReqT): Flux&lt;RespT&gt; {
            return subscriptions.compute(request) { req, latest -&gt;
                if (latest != null &amp;&amp; !latest.isTerminated) {
                    latest
                } else {
                    val upstream = subscribe(req)
                    val processor = ReplayProcessor.create&lt;RespT&gt;(numberOfCachedItemsAtStart)
                    upstream.subscribe(processor)
                    processor
                }
            }!!
        }
    
        private fun totalUpstreams(): Int = subscriptions.values.size
        private fun activeUpstreams(): Int = subscriptions.values.count { !it.isTerminated }
        internal fun downstreamsNumber(request: ReqT): Long = subscriptions.getValue(request).downstreamCount()
    }

Here you see that we store a map of subscriptions where the keys are requests which received from the consumers and the values are Project Reactor FluxProcessors which help us to shift messages from an upstream subscription to downstream subscriptions.

Also we create some meters to have an opportunity to monitor number of alive and dead upstreams we have in the `Multicast`.

In the main `invoke` method, which essentially is a kotlin `Operator`, we check wether we have an existing `FluxProcessor` related to the specified request. If we have - we reuse it. Otherwise - we create a new upstream connection provided through the `subscribe` lambda in the class constructor, and then we create new `ReplayProcessor` which essentially is a Project Reactor `FluxProcessor` supporting a history of messages with a manageable history depth. This `ReplayProcessor` allows us to set a `numberOfCachedItemsAtStart` which we often use to store snapshot data. The created `ReplayProcessor` immediately subscribes to the upstream we initialized before, and then we return a `Flux` from the prepared `FluxProcessor`.

Also you can see that when we reuse an existing `FluxProcessor` we check wether it's terminated or not. It's necessary for the case when a client subscribed to our upstream, then unsubscribed (hence the `FluxProcessor` terminated) and then another client tries to subscribe. Of course in this case we should create a brand new `FluxProcessor` and we do it.

However, either of these [calls](https://github.com/DeflatedPickle/ducknroll/commit/374f72de259d4606e20dc0369f9c2fcf72ca9cbb#diff-9f158b81a446ad38bfadaa041350dda7L37), both throw a non-sense error.

What's the error? Why `finished with non-zero exit value -1073741571`, of course!

Now, I can comment out that `print`, and it'll run fine. Until I run the [map command](https://github.com/DeflatedPickle/ducknroll/blob/map-command/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/deflatedpickle/ducknroll/common/command/MapCommand.kt#L20), which takes in the player, where (for testing), it `prints` out the executor. If, in the command, I take out the `print`, again, it works perfectly fine. I can pass around `player`, but not use it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, to test if it was a scoping issue, I moved it into its own `ThreadLocal` tagged `object`, but the same error was thrown. Note: You could still `print` it fine outside of the lambda or extended class update method.

I've never encountered an error that's like this, where I can't use an object in a nested scope, even if it's static.

672,2020-05-08 15:40:13,6,1,"Hi, I made two simple, quick + dirty, samples to compare a few important REST features in **KTor** \+ **Spring Boot**

KTor: [https://github.com/MikeMitterer/kotlin-catshostel-kt](https://github.com/MikeMitterer/kotlin-catshostel-kt)

Spring Boot: [https://github.com/MikeMitterer/kotlin-catshostel-sb](https://github.com/MikeMitterer/kotlin-catshostel-sb)

If you are interested - check it out.

The reason for me was that SparkJava seems to be dead so I have to check out some alternatives.

My first attempt was Ktor - and boy... documentation is sometimes wrong or incomplete and it took me quite a while to assemble the example. Ktor tries to avoid the SB-magic but replaces it with Extension-Function-magic. Extension-Functions are a really cool Kotlin feature but in my opinion they overused them in Ktor.

    /**
     * Reads resource from ClassPath
     * How cool ist this!
     */
    fun String.asResource(): String {
        return this.javaClass.getResource(this).readText()
    }

Second approach - Spring Boot. I had never used SB before. Usually I stay away from these ""magic things"" but I was really surprised how well it worked and how easy it was to assemble this thing with Kotlin.

This means for my next project: Kotlin + Spring Boot",Spring Boot vs. Ktor (iBats + JWT (mimics KeyCloak))

Kweb incorporates a DSL which corresponds roughly to various aspects of HTML and JavaScript - and to make this work it relies on a lot of extension functions, you can find an example [here](https://github.com/kwebio/kweb-core/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/kweb/prelude.kt).

Previously these extension functions were categorized into different packages, but I found that this often required a large number of `import` statements at the top of every file.  Even when these are created automatically by the IDE, I still found it rather unweildy.

So I made the decision to move almost all extension functions to the `kweb` package so that they could be imported with a simple `import kweb.*`.

Is this a common pattern, or is there a better way to avoid needing a large number of import statements for extension functions?","How to avoid ""import hell"" when your DSL has a large number of extension functions"

And the Kotlin documentation claims:

&gt; Methods that follow the Java conventions for getters and setters (no-argument methods with names starting with get and single-argument methods with names starting with set) are represented as properties in Kotlin. Boolean accessor methods (where the name of the getter starts with is and the name of the setter starts with set) are represented as properties which have the same name as the getter method.

Of course, the rule is that .getFoo() maps to a .foo property. Note the downcasing; the property on the Kotlin side is called .foo and not .Foo. So maybe it’s called .uRLs? Close, but no cigar!

Those days are gone when you blindly prefer Java for android based projects. As time passed, Kotlin emerged as the tough competitor of Java for android development. Now it’s time to switch over Kotlin. It is not just about the popularity amongst the developers but also the advantages over Java. Before comparing Kotlin with java, Let see some basics of Kotlin-

### What is Kotlin?

 

Kotlin is developed by JetBrains, and was first released in 2016. Immediately after the launch, it has gained a lot of popularity among the android community. And it gained momentum when google announced Kotlin as a first-class language for developing Android apps at the I/O 2017.

When it comes to its usability, Kotlin has a set of tools and frameworks that work with Java. Its advanced compiler can check the errors during compile time and run time also. It also reduces the lines of code to a great extent. Kotlin has everything that developers need and couldn’t find in Java or any other alternative like JRuby or Groovy. It is concise and completely interoperable with Java. Also, Kotlin came with higher compatibility with Android Studio in which IntelliJ IDEA, JetBrains’ own Java IDE serves as the backbone. Know the best Kotlin server-side frameworks at- [**5 Best Kotlin Server-side frameworks**](https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/5-best-kotlin-server-side-frameworks/).

## What Is The Problem With Java?

Java was released 20 years ago. And hence each new version of Java has to be compatible with the previous version. It becomes a challenge to compete with newer, more concise, expressive programming languages. Java is still the official programming language for android development but it just starts to show its limitations and its age.

## Reasons To Use Kotlin Over Java-

 

### 1. Easy Code-

Kotlin programs are easy to code as it does not need semicolons in their program. Also, they have smart casts and string templates. Java is not a concise language and it increases the chances of bugs. Kotlin is a concise language that means having fewer chances of runtime and compile-time errors. Kotlin provides an easy way to use mutable and immutable declarations for different data structures.

### 2. Completely Interoperable With Java-

One of the biggest advantages of Kotlin is, it is compatible with java. With multiple ways, it can easily use and exchange information from Java. Code of Kotlin and Java can co-exist in the same project. Kotlin can perform well with Java programming language. You can use multiple java libraries in Kotlin projects and this makes it more compatible. Compatibility is not just about the libraries but also with some advanced frameworks. You can use easily use Kotlin from Java by just converting a complete project to Kotlin. This is the biggest advantage for developers that they do not need to learn a new language. Anyone who is proficient with Java can easily code in Kotlin.

### 3. More Concise Than Java-

Every Kotlin programmer is happy with this feature. Kotlin is a statically-typed language that is very easy to read and write. You can solve the same problem with fewer lines of code and this reduces the number of bugs and crashes on the UX side. Due to the fewer lines of code, it becomes-

* Easy to maintain, 
* Easy to read and 
* Simple to apply changes when required.

There are some Kotlin features that are responsible for its code conciseness are- Data classes,  Smart casts, Type interface, Properties

### 4. Smart And Safe Compiler-

One of the main goals of Kotlin’s development team was to add a good compiler. And here are some important aspects of the compiler in Kotlin-

* It performs a lot of efficient checks, decreasing runtime errors, and the bugs in code.
* It detects errors at compile time not at runtime, by using the “fail-fast” principle.

### 5. Easy To Maintain-

Kotlin supports a lot of IDEs including Android Studio hence It is a “one-stop language” for all application development. You can freely use all those you have already tried and tested development tools that you’re comfortable to maintain code. As the Kotlin possesses fewer lines of code, it is easy to maintain and work upon. This is one of the best advantages over Java.

### 6. Eliminating Null References:

The biggest advantage over Java is null references. Accessing a member of null reference results in a null reference exception and this is a significant drawback of Java called as NullPointerException or NPE. The type system of Kotlin is dedicated to eliminate NullPointerException from code.

The possible causes of NPE’s may be:

1. An explicit call to throw NullPointerException();
2. Usage of the !! operator;
3. Java interoperation:

* When try to access a member on a null reference of a platform type;
* Generic types used for Java interoperation with incorrect nullability, e.g. a piece of Java code might add null into a Kotlin MutableList&lt;String&gt;, meaning that MutableList&lt;String?&gt; should be used for working with it;

4. Some data inconsistency with initialization, when:

An uninitialized this available in a constructor is passed and used somewhere (“leaking this”);

A superclass constructor calls an open member whose implementation in the derived class uses uninitialized state;

### 7. Solution To Java’s Issue-

Old java has a lot of issues. It hinders a well-known issue of null pointer. Kotlin tried to solve these issues. To overcome difficulties of java, it has adopted things from multiple languages like C# and Scala. It has instances from the Pascal language and is considered as very influential in Kotlin’s development. Some of the elements such as parameter lists and variable declarations with data type following a variable could be in Kotlin. It eliminates the error by removing the boilerplate code. It has some features like late initializations, delegations and also addresses a type safety. Kotlin was easy to type wrongly typed variables to a list before generics came along. This would typically lead to blowing up during the run time because the compiler does not detect it.

### 8. Improves Productivity-

Kotlin has been built with developer productivity in mind and is the key advantage of Kotlin over Java. Also, it’s a given that improved productivity returns to concise code itself, including its natural syntax and its general clean language design. It will need less time to write new code, deploy it, and maintain it in Kotlin. Concise and clear code in Kotlin helps to improve the developers’ productivity. Kotlin has a lot of powerful features that accelerate development tasks. These features are-

* Object declarations
* Parameter values
* Extension functions

I'm here looking for some advices. Lately I've got interested in GUI and mobile dev, expecially on Android. I started to code in Python for scientific and math usage but now I really got into programming and I wanted to develop a small app for my smartphone. I tried with Python libraries like Kivy and QtPy but it seems I can't get a nice result. It always feels that the app is old or crunchy or not...nice enough.

Recently I've used an app written in Kotlin and It felt like a really good one, runs smooth and was pretty nice to use. 

I thought ""I could program for a hundred years in Kivy but I'll never get this result"".

So I am willing to move to Kotlin, for now for Android programming at least.

The big problem is I have 0 knoledge about Java, javascript and JVM. I never had to aproach them, because the compilation in Python is done by some libraries called ""buildozer"", I just had to install JDK and SDK... so now I feel like I have this big black hole in my head with ""Java"" written on it. 

So now that you know my goal, can you guys suggest me something to start with?

A course, a book or some documentation could be great, but I'd like to know what I am actually doing. For example, I tried to look for the documentation on Intellij IDE website and it's great that they teach you to write ""Hello world"" and other simple stuff in Kotlin. But I don't know how and from which interpreter the file I've written gets compiled, for example. I'd really like to know what's happening, t have a full vision of the environment (if it's possible of course).

I'm a beginner android dev using kotlin, and I'm working on this weather app. I was just seeking some advice as to how better use my code.

My problem is that I currently fetch all of my data from an api within an a 'fetchJson' method. the 'client.newCall().. object i don't fully understand, as I followed a tutorial to fetch API information. a snippet of it is here:

    private fun fetchJson(location: com.stefanalexnovak.weatherapplication.location.Location) {
    
    var myUrl = ""https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lat=${location.latitude}&amp;lon=${location.longitude}&amp;exclude=minutely&amp;appid=MYAPIKEY""
    
    
    val request = Request.Builder().url(myUrl).build()
    
            client.newCall(request).enqueue(object : Callback {
                override fun onFailure(call: Call, e: IOException) {
                    println(""Failed to execute request"")
                }
    
                @RequiresApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.O)
                override fun onResponse(call: Call, response: Response) {
                    val body = response.body?.string()
                    println(body)
    
                    val gson = GsonBuilder().create()
    
                    val weatherData = gson.fromJson(body, WeatherData::class.java)
    
                    runOnUiThread { Large amounts of populating UI with data }
    
    

The problem I'm seeing is that if I wanted to do anything with my weatherData value, I can only access it from within this method. This causes problems for future things I have in mind such as swiping to a new location and repopulating the data with a new URL, or sending notifications to the app with snippets of weather details.

So my question is it possible to move this all to some kind of higher level function maybe? (sorry thats probably wrong terminology.) I'd really like to just have this class of weather data, to be used at any point throughout my application. Is that possible?

I’ve a Spring Boot web application that has a gRPC client. Following are the requirements/constraints on the system:

1. Messages from the gRPC server could be informational or *commands*.
2. The client has internal state, that may change depending on the commands received from the server. Informational messages don’t affect client state.
3. Based on the commands received from the server, the client may generate more messages for the server, or update its internal state, or do both.
4. Every client message generated due to a server command *must happen after* any state changes.

My current design is as follows;

1. The client is a Spring bean. It has a reference to its internal state, which is a POJO (or POKO, if you want)
2. Upon receiving a server message, it constructs a command instance and passes the message content and the client state to the command. This happens in a gRPC streaming receiver, which runs on a gRPC thread pool (default).
3. The command instance may update the client state, and returns one or messages to the client.
4. The client, running within an Unconfined dispatcher, puts the messages in a buffered Channel, and waits for the next server message.
5. A Channel consumer, running on Kotlin default dispatcher pool, picks up the messages and sends them to the server.

Notice that requirement #4 is satisfied by design steps #3 and #5.

Questions:

1. I keep hearing that Flow is recommended over Channel. In this case though, the Channel  
 needs to stay open throughout the lifecycle of the client, and is very easy to use as an async queue. What benefits, if any, are there for using a Flow in this case?
2. I don’t feel particularly good about passing the client state to the commands. Is there a different way of achieving requirement #4 without doing this? (actors, may be)

I recently enrolled in Svetlana Isakova @ JetBrains' excellent coursera course ""Kotlin for Java developers"" I found it supremely informative and though I have not finished yet, I was motivated enough to complete 4.5 of the five weeks of material in just a few days. While I am used to Java and personally do not like using some other languages like python, I could immediately see the great advantages that Kotlin offers. I have decided to list some of my top 5 reasons to use Kotlin so that others may be swayed.

1. Java interoperability. Kotlin can be used with java code in a project directly, can be seamlessly converted to from java and can use any Java library.

2.:Runs on JVM, Android, JavaScript(!) and native executables on certain platforms. You can use it everywhere you can use java and beyond.

3.:It's clean and concise. Seriously, it is just so much more compact. On occasions I've been able to condense 20 lines of java into 4 lines of Kotlin. I think that speaks for itself.

4.: Functional And Oop. I think Kotlin strikes a great balance between a pure functional style as seen e.g. in Haskell and a classic Object oriented approach like I was familiar with from Java and c#. Depending on your preferences, you can use both styles. I think this aids a great deal in transitioning to the language.

5. Easy to learn from a Java background. As I have already said, I went from knowing literally nothing in Kotlin to a rather respectable level in just a few days. Transposing and transferring prior knowledge from Java to Kotlin works seamlessly and if you forget how to do something in Kotlin, you can just write it in java and either use the java code directly or convert it to Kotlin code.

739,2020-08-02 12:40:51,5,1,"Dear Friends,

&amp;#x200B;

I developed an Android app that makes intensive use of the JSoup library to parse HTML. As an example, I will say that this happens inside a class called CustomHtmlAnalyzer.kt. After a couple of years developing this app, my CustomHtmlAnalyzer is grown, is complex, and works very well. I have covered it with a lot of unit tests, and I have all under control.

Now I'm porting the Android app to a native iOS app, and I reached the point where a I need the same CustomHtmlAnalyzer class but for iOS. Fortunately, there is a pod library for iOS called SwiftSoup, which works like Jsoup. I could write a copy of my CustomHtmlAnalyzer but in Swift. Besides that, I could translate each function and line of code. They would be pretty much the same, only written in Swift.

Would it be possible to reuse the class that I wrote in Kotlin, using kotlin native? I can abstract this class from jsoup, and then somehow configure the shared code that in case of the Android app, the jsoup library is used, and in case of the iOS version, the SwiftSoup library is used.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw a similar sample regarding the Android SharedPreferences, and the iOS UserDefaults. In this case, using the expected/actual feature, it is possible to call platform-dependent functions. Of course, the android SharedPreferences and iOS UserDefaults are supported natively by Kotlin Native.  


And because of that my question. Would it be achievable somehow, using libraries that are not natively supported, like in this case Jsoup and SwiftSoup?

If you know some examples or post in the internet where this is explained, I would be very grateful.

This is very broken and doesn't work. For starters it's like the dependencies get ignored. With my MPP attempted build.gradle.kts whenever I go to my code there are errors everywhere because the dependencies aren't properly build handled. Another issue I'm facing is the fact nothing is being shaded in the jars (Because dependencies are being ignored). The last issue I'm dealing with is that this MPP build.gradle.kts creates 3 jars instead of 1, before it just created  Ride-1.0.0.jar but now it creates  Ride-1.0.0.jar, Ride-jvm-1.0.0.jar, and Ride-metadata-1.0.0.jar.

1) `brew install gradle` - it installs `openjdk` as a dependency, even though I already had HotSpot JDK installed, but ok, whatever.

2) `gradle init` - and my project is polluted with garbage - gradle.build (ok that one is expected) and also - gradlew, gradlew.bat, gradle/wrapper, config.something.gradle, properties.gradle, .gitattributes. 

WTF is that shit? Tiny build utility the whole point of which is to sit somewhere in background and don't interrupt me with just the first step - init - put tons of garbage in my project, and not in some dark corner of the project in hidden directory, but at the very top?!

3) Ok, I manually removed all that garbage, leaving only `gradle.build`, trying `gradle run` from the console - all good.

4) Time to connect with Intelij IDEA, creating/importing project. IDEA slowly thinking for a minute, then - regenerates all that gradle garbage again. All the gradle files I manually deleted - are still in the project looking at me.

5) Ok after asking - some people told me that I need to change setting in IDEA so it will take gradle from predefined location. I changed - and it worked, for couple of minutes, until I updated gradle.build - and suddenly it became red in IDEA, all sorts of errors (still works fine from console).",How do you people use such a piece of shit as Gradle?

I got into coding with Cheat Engine by learning ASM then learning CE included LUA.  Which got me into VBA a dead language, but it was very LUA like so it was easy to catch on.  Then I moved into C# which I HATE . Hate Arduino IDE. Hate the syntax errors, the overuse of defines, terrible arrays and SEMICOLONS. A uint8\_t cost me 3 nights of troubleshooting before. I dont like C# in Visual Studio either.   


Back to this Android App im writing. So I try to learn Xamarin. NOPE to that. idk who had the bright idea of breaking Visual Studio's interface with the Xamarin extension but that team should be fired. The Official Xamarin youtube channel actually steers you towards a PAID extension for GUI design.   


So I reluctantly downloaded Android Studio and decided to learn Kotlin over Java. Couple reasons why Kotlin over Java 1. the tutorial I was watching was in Kotlin 2. MOST important Java uses this ""  ;  "" , ugh semicolons. Them things suck they a relic of old language compilers that couldnt understand lines or defines properly.

763,2020-09-03 20:55:24,9,1,"Is it possible to use kotlin reflection, perhaps in combination with invocation handlers, to implement a generic version of copy(), as it works on data classes? 

Let's say we have a factory, something like:

```
object Model {

    inline fun &lt;reified T&gt; init(): T {
        ...
    }
}
```

...which given an interface as the type parameter, could give you back a decorated/proxied object that implemented the interface, and provided the copy() function.

We could say that allowable interfaces have to implement some other interface that has a generic definition of the copy function on it, perhaps:

```
interface DecoratedInterface {
     fun copy(vararg params: Any) 
}
```

However, we don't want to rely on positional parameters, and we don't want to use strings to identify the parameters (i.e. a Map&lt;String, Any&gt; is no bueno).

So, putting it together, what we'd want is to be able to do something like:

```
interface Foo: DecoratedInterface {
     val marg: String
     val peanut: Int
     val marmite: Boolean
}

val foo = Model.init&lt;Foo&gt;()  
// somehow set values on it
val bah = foo.copy(peanut=8)

So, I write C++ and occasionally some Java (a desktop Swing application) for a living. Been thinking about trying out Kotlin for a while, finally found a reason: Compile &amp; patch [https://github.com/manuelsc/HDDFs-MPG-Dumper](https://github.com/manuelsc/HDDFs-MPG-Dumper)

I got to say, Kotlin kicked my ass today. It wasn't even the language that did it for me. It's Maven and the build tools. The IDEs did not help.

So I tried Eclipse, loaded in the Kotlin plugin, made a Kotlin project, set it as a Maven thingy and BAM, Kotlin dependencies disappeared. WTF. Mind you I've never used Maven (I'm quite happy with Ant, and I loath Make, MsBuild is pretty bad). Googled for help, found a terrible tutorial. Decided that maybe Eclipse's shitty Kotlin-Maven support was a sign I should try something else.

So I looked at the .gitignore file, it mentioned IDEA project files, so I'm like ""welp it's about time I tried out Intellij again"" I've used Eclipse for all of my Java development (it's the only thing Eclipse is good at). The nice thing about Eclipse is you can mostly ignore dependency problem, just put the jars in a folder and pull them into the project dependencies. What you see is what you get. Unless I completely missed it Intellij, completely lacks anything remotely useful to help new users out with Maven. I've been thrown into the deep end of Maven. Finally dropped the dependencies in and... The Maven Central site Intellij tried to pulled the dependencies from didn't have it. I couldn't even figure out what to google for that one.

So I went back to Eclipse, made a new project, not a Maven Project, and downloaded the jars from Maven Central, added them as dependencies to the Java project, Eclipse was happy. No errors, no unhappy squiggles. And then I tried to launch it. org.jetbrains.kotlin.ui.console is like ""ERROR: Unresolved reference: java (3, 8)"" along with pages more of errors like it can't find jack shit. Regular console is like ""Error: Could not find or load main class MainKt""

774,2020-09-09 08:56:35,0,1,"**How we built Localazy CLI, command-line friendly software localization tool for smart&amp;lazy developers.** 

We thought about the right solution that would enable other developers to use Localazy on all platforms. We wanted to keep the developer-friendly / developer-centric approach and CLI, aka the command line interface, was the logical answer. 

We wanted **Localazy CLI** to be supported on all major platforms. Ideally, we wanted no dependency on Java or Node as those usually mean a huge binary or giant virtual machine. Small and fast binary for a given operating system looked like a perfect solution.

Kotlin is already heavily used at Localazy, and it powers the whole backend. And so [*Kotlin MPP*](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/mpp-intro.html) was a logical choice to look at for this task. It allowed us to write a single codebase for native Linux, macOS, Windows and Java in a programming language we know well.  


Almost all the code is shared between platforms and written in pure Kotlin. There were only two platform-dependent features - filesystem access and HTTP communication.

The filesystem access is quite simple, and we just create an actual implementation for Java (using java.io.File and streams), Linux/macOS (using POSIX) and Windows (slightly modified POSIX as there are small differences on Windows).

For HTTP communication, good old *HTTPUrlConnection* is used for Java and *ktor client* for Linux, macOS and Windows. The prototype of CLI was ready in a couple of days, and with a bit of fine-tuning, we were able to compile it to Java’s JAR and native binary for Linux, macOS and Windows.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's probably a faux pas to discuss the solution publicly, but if you know how you'd do it, would you at least shoot me a private message?

I can see the ""shape"" of a solution would be something like this:

    object OptionalSyntax {
        fun &lt;T&gt; bind(o: Optional&lt;T&gt;): T = TODO()
        fun &lt;T&gt; yield(() -&gt; T): Complete&lt;T&gt; = TODO()

    fun &lt;T&gt; `for`(OptionalSyntax.() -&gt; Complete&lt;T&gt;): Optional&lt;T&gt; = TODO()

798,2020-10-01 12:43:08,10,1,"Actually, the main problem is still that there are no reified typeargs for classes in Kotlin (see [my other reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/hexe8l/discussion_do_you_think_this_would_be_a_cool/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)). But here is why this bothers me in this specific case:

Suppose you have a wrapper class `Wrapper` that takes in a string `content` and a class\* `type` and can output an object of class `type` retrieved by parsing `content` as JSON by demand by calling the function `getObj()`:

    class Wrapper&lt;T&gt;(private val content: String, /*private val type: KClass&lt;*&gt;*/) {
        fun getObj(): T {
            // ?
        }
    }

And I want to use kotlinx.serialization. Now, you might have noticed how I put an asterisk after ""class"" before. Here's the reason: Yes, `Wrapper` has to take the target class in _some_ way, but how? Should it be just the typearg (won't work because type erausre) or a `KClass` reference (won't work because I need a reified typearg)? 

The thing is that as far as I know, the only way to decode a generic JSON to a serializable target class is to use `Json.decodeFromString&lt;T&gt;(content)`, where `T` is the target type and `content` is the JSON string. Now, `T` is defined to be reified (so that the type can be processed at runtime) and can only be filled with another reified typearg or an actual class reference. I can't use another reified typearg because I am in the context of a class and a class cannot have reified typeargs. I can also not use an actual class reference because the user of the class should be able to construct it with different targets, e.g. they decide what the target is, not me.

So, how do I do this with kotlinx.serialization? Is it even possible?",Kotlinx Serialization: How to circumvent reified typeargs for deserialization?

I am trying to learn kotlin and the gradle build system using kotlin dsl all at the same time. And it is super confusing. Nothing seems straight forward. I am not new to programming at all by any stretch. But I am new to kotlin and the entire java ecosystem. And I want to learn this as soon as possible because, I will start work on a very large kotlin/gradle project at work very soon.

At the moment, I am trying to do the following just to test out the kotlin language, and learn more about the gradle/kotlin DSL build system.

1. create a kotlin project with gradle/kotlinDSL as build system
2. add the fuel (http client) as a dependency.
3. use fuel to make a http request.

At the moment I am stuck at ""adding fuel as a dependency"". In intellij, I added fuel as a dependency in project settings but still i keep getting ""unresolved reference""


Here are some of the problems I faced and does not seem straight-forward for someone that has been coding professionally for a long time, but is very new to the java ecosystem.

* couldn't find the one package manager. python has pypi. rust has crates. c# has nuget. So I naively assumed I would find something like that in the java/jvm/kotlin world. Oh boy, how wrong I was.
* theres like 10 different JDKs. I am not sure which one is the most used and which one I should use.
* confusion about what the JDK is. Is it the compiler , runtime and standard libraries. ?
* there is jscentral. maven central. and many others. Are they repositories of java libraries? kotlin libraries? or a combination of both.
* can i use any java libary with kotlin? Or are there some java libraries that won't work with kotlin? If so how do I tell if a java library will not work with kotlin
* are libraries restricted to working on only certain SDKs and not others?
* what is a module? can modules exist within other modules? In the c# world a solution can have many projects. Is it something like that?

I have so many other questions and If I seem frustrated, my apologies. I have been trying to get fuel added as a dependency and It just wont work. I've been trying to work this out for the past one day.

Otherwise, I think kotlin is a beauty. I just wish it was easier to understand the ecosytem.

Any help or document/tutorial/book that will help me to answer some or all these questions will be appreciated.","New to kotlin, gradle. Does it get easier? Otherwise, kotlin is a beauty."

Now the problem is that I wasn't able to find _any_ information about KXS-properties at all, except for

1. it exists (artifact name kotlinx-serialization-properties),
2. it's official and 
3. it's experimental.

I couldn't even find out what's the most recent version, I had to resort to Maven Central to find it out (turns out it'S aligned with all other KXS artifacts, so 1.0.0). I'm completely clueless about how to use it in my project. I have `implementation(""org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-serialization-properties:1.0.0"")` in my `build.gradle.kts`, but that is basically everything. No answers for questions like:

- Can I have model classes like it's usual in JSON serialization / deserialization?
- If yes, are there any intricacies on how to design .properties model classes?
- Is the frontend unified (meaning that model classes are applicable for every format)?
- How do I actually serialize and deserialize to/from Properties??

* Creating UUIDs look ugly
* Creating UUIDs takes up a lot of space
* Creating UUIDs decrease the readability.

This might all be minor gripes I have, but I like my tests to be short and clean.

The most common way to generate a human-readable UUID is doing the following:

    UUID.fromString(""00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"")

If you use .toUUID() you can get the same result like this:

    1.toUUID()

There's also a few more bells and whistles like generating UUIDs based on a collection, varargs, range of integers or even in a sequence.

If  you find yourself having to deal with UUIDs in automated tests, or you  want to generate a set of simple UUIDs quickly, then .toUUID() might be  up your alley:

Turns out there apparently isn't, but the comments and my sourcecode-digging helped me out. The problem however is that KXS-properties is only capable of converting an object of an arbitrary model class into a **flat** `Map&lt;String, Any&gt;`, the keys already being in the correct format. Now there is still the last step needed, namely converting the map into a string that conforms the properties format (and vice versa). You might think that cannot be too hard, but it turns out that the [specification of the properties format](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.Reader)) is a lot more intricate than one might think.

I found a way to avoid writing the entire encoding / decoding on my own, just by using `java.util.Properties` and the `load()` and `store()` methods. To make this quick solution available to everyone, I created a public gist. If you need this functionality in your code, just copy paste the following:

https://gist.github.com/RaphaelTarita/748e02c06574b20c25ab96c87235096d

However, there are two major problems with this solution:

1. The usage of `java.util.Properties` makes the solution JVM-dependent. And this kinda kills the idea of KXS, which is mainly to be multiplatform. I'm currently considering to actually implement the encoding / decoding on my own, but it's gonna be tedious.

2. Right now, all values are mapped to their `toString()` results. Normally, you'd have to inject all custom serializers at this point, but I have no idea how to do this so that it does not involve runtime reflection. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Anyways, for now this Gist exists, despite the problems it has. So if you need to serialize a model class and encode it to a stringified `.properties` file (or vice versa), feel free to make use of this snippet.",First attempt at a StringFormat for KXS-properties

840,2020-11-10 15:49:18,7,1,"Hi everyone!

I’m a really big fan of Kotlin and I’m, fascinated by the idea of using [Kotlin Mobile Multiplatform aka KMM](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/) for sharing code between mobile platforms. Why do we keep on doing fully native applications while it is possible to share code and keep UI native (IMHO the only part that should remain native)?  
I was spreading this idea around Android and iOS teams. And it was quite contagious, not as coronavirus but still all of my Android teammates are ready to try KMM in our project and even some of the iOS mates want to try too. But here we come to the problem – our manager Rick. He is old school and does not trust new trends in development, he is the type of person who would start using KMM only after Facebook is rewritten to KMM. As I understand from [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile goes Alpha blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2020/08/kotlin-multiplatform-mobile-goes-alpha/?_ga=2.254447435.290197248.1604915804-1660784246.1601558560) and [Kotlin 1.4 online event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW-jkOLucjM) the Kotlin team is promoting KMM as a technology that is ready for production. They have got a [series of case studies about KMM used in production](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/case-studies/) on their KMM portal. All of these efforts should make developers and managers believe that KMM is ok ready to be used. But despite many advantages that it brings to a project many developers and managers (like our Rick) are still doubt its usage and wait some more time to understand if there are there any underwater rocks in these technologies.

So may you answer a simple question: Is it ready for production or not?

Feel free to share your experience and thoughts.",Is KMM ready for production technology?

Currently I am trying to play a sound depending on the input using MediaPlayer.Create, but only seems to work when I have the device plugged in and hit ""Apply Changes and Restart Activity."" It does not seem to work if I were to just open the app and test, only after going through the process stated before. Is there a better way of reading the inputstream and handling that data? Is there also a better way to go about how I am playing a sound in the run() function of the ConnectedThread thread? This is my current code. I am also thinking of switching from MediaPlayer to SoundPool because I would like to play multiple sounds simultaneously, would that also be a good option?

847,2020-11-16 16:40:37,57,19,"The implementation looks like this in Map.kt:

    @kotlin.internal.InlineOnly
    public inline fun &lt;K, V&gt; Map&lt;K, V&gt;.getOrElse(key: K, defaultValue: () -&gt; V): V = get(key) ?: defaultValue()

Which seems trivial at first glance, but is incorrect if `V` is nullable, which *is* allowed in Map. So if you use `getOrElse` on your map that can have null values, you're very likely making a mistake.

Below it, in the same file, I see:

    internal inline fun &lt;K, V&gt; Map&lt;K, V&gt;.getOrElseNullable(key: K, defaultValue: () -&gt; V): V {
        val value = get(key)

            return value as V
        }
    }

Which is more correct, IMO. But it's internal. Why doesn't Kotlin use the safer version by default? And why doesn't it at least *expose* the safer version as an option?",I think the (JVM?) implementation of Map.getOrElse is confusing.

853,2020-11-22 17:36:46,6,1,"Hey there,   
I was going through the documentation for [Scope Functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/scope-functions.html) and there is something that I don't understand regarding the **it** context object. So in the documentation, there's a line that says: 

    However, when calling the object functions or properties you don't have the object available implicitly like this. Hence, having the context object as it is better when the object is mostly used as an argument in function calls. 

Can anyone explain this part to me? I'm having some trouble understanding it. 

Thanks for all the help :)",Doubt Regarding Context Objects In Scope Functions

When I upgrade the version of Kotlin to 1.4, the IDE can't resolve common libraries such as kotlinx.coroutines.

It would say, for instance, unresolved reference: 'Deferred' for kotlinx.coroutines.Deferred.

The code still builds fine, but it flags them as errors in the code editor.

Also, the IR javascript compiler seems to have issues with testing suspend functions.

Previously, I tested suspend functions with the following hacky code:

    actual fun testSuspend(
    	context: CoroutineContext,
    	block: suspend CoroutineScope.() -&gt; Unit
    ): dynamic = GlobalScope.promise(context = context, block = block)

870,2020-12-02 23:27:41,12,1,"I've tried googling this to no avail.  My main question is: is there any consequence to using lambdas instead of methods in a class.  If not, is there any consequence to always using lambdas and forgoing the `fun` syntax.

For example:

```kotlin
class MyClass {
    private fun myMethod() {
        println(""This is a regular class method"")
    }

    private val myLamda = {
        println(""This is my lambda class method"")
    }
}
```

When hovering over a similar example in Android Studio, the types come back as: `private final val myLamda: () -&gt; Unit` and `private final fun myMethod(): Unit`

The reason I ask is because I've primarily been a React TypeScript/JavaScript developer.  Kotlin is extremely similar to TypeScript and I'm really enjoying it.  However, in React, everyone has primarily switched over to arrow functions (lambdas).  There is a bigger reason behind this in React, regarding the `this` keyword and not having to bind it and so forth but it has become natural.  I would like to continue this in Kotlin unless this is not considered a good practice or if it has any negative downsides that come alongside it.  I'm still learning Kotlin; I have almost completed the vanilla (not KMP, etc) documentation on KotlinLang and have been following a Kotlin Android tutorial, but I haven't read of any reason not to use a lambda and wonder, ""Why not just always use lambdas as most do now in the JavaScript/TypeScript language?""

Thanks!",When not to use lamdas?
871,2020-12-03 01:16:51,10,1,"Hi All!  I already posted this on KotlinLang Slack #general, but I don't think that precludes me seeking advice here, too. Apologies if so.

I am looking for some ideas and perspectives on deserialisation, delegation, and type-safety, please.

For the sake of argument, I am using `Protobuf` and Square's `Wire` to serialise data, and to deserialise into Kotlin. Just like the example at [https://github.com/square/wire#protocol-buffers](https://github.com/square/wire#protocol-buffers) I have a common `Dinosaur` message which has got a `name` string.

The first and obvious change in the direction that I want to go, would be to replace the `name` with a protobuf `enum` so that I get `Dinosaur.STEGOSAURUS` (etc) as a nameEnum, which means that the code can find out the soft-type of the message; but that doesn't give me what I want.

The second approach would be to use the protobuf `oneof` type - and it would essentially do exactly the same soft-type thing - I could use `Dinosaur.STEGOSAURUS.foo.bar` \- but that still does not give me what I want.

What I **want** is for the deserialisation process of a `Dinosaur` message to yield a `Stegosaurus` type; or a `TRex` or `Apatosaurus` type, or whatever, so that resulting code can guarantee having an `Apatosaurus` passed into it.  I am presuming that some sort `of DinosaurParser.peekType()` or `DinosaurParser.getApatosaurusOrThrow()`\-code will be needed, along with a type-enforcement `is/as` check.

But that leaves me with the question of delegation so that I can access the **other** fields of the `Dinosaur` message, like (examples tbd) `height` and `weight`, etc. So:

* what's the best way for me to convert a ""Dinosaur-message-with-TRex-soft-type"" in the serialisation domain
* into a kotlin-domain strongly-typed-instance-of-`TRex` that the compiler can check
* but also inherit (delegate?) all the accessors and methods from the underlying `Dinosaur` message, into the `TRex` instance?

It would be nice to have a delegation pattern like:

`class TRex(d: Dinosaur) : Dinosaur by d`

...however the Wire protobuf compilers are generating `Dinosaur` classes, **not interfaces**, so I don't believe that option is currently open to me. 

For the avoidance of doubt: the fields of all `Dinosaur` messages, etc, will be common across all of `TRex`, `Stegosaurus`, `Apatosaurus`, etc; so it would be redundant and wasteful to have separate Protobuf ""messages"" for each, plus it would cause proliferation of other handler code that could simply be written in terms of `Dinosaur`. The messages will be immutable and extension methods on `Dinosaur` will provide any necessary magic accessors. The goal is to use Kotlin type-safety for code which demands one-or-other specific kinds of `Dinosaur`.

Also: yes I note that there is a cute [""Extract interface"" feature in Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/extract-interface.html), but I don't feel it's elegant enough a solution for production code - the goal is for Gradle to do everything,, even from the command line.

872,2020-12-03 11:48:12,7,1,"Some languages, e.g. swift and kotlin support trailing lambda syntax - when the last parameter of the function is a lambda it can be supplied outside of the () which makes it very expressive and easy to read

I want it to be really light-weight and I don't mind if it's tightly coupled with my Ktor backend.

&amp;#x200B;

I've the following frameworks/libs I've looked at,

&amp;#x200B;

1. Kotlin React (kotlin-wrappers)
2. Fritz2
3. KVision
4. KWeb (server-side rendering)

I see the point of using Kotlin React by having a huge framework in the back. But at the same time I can't help but be impressed by ones like Fritz2 (no virtual DOM, very lightweight) &amp; KWeb (smart server-side rendering).

896,2020-12-18 17:30:41,4,1,"To learn about Coroutines I attempted to convert my hobby project to use them. Doing so I ran into some difficulties which I was able to solve but I'm wondering if it is the optimal solution.

1. I had to switch from `spring-boot-starter-web` to `spring-boot-starter-webflux` so I can use the `coRouter` in the router DSL. Is this really necessary?
2. I have some IO which I wrapped with `withContext(`[`Dispatchers.IO`](https://Dispatchers.IO)`) {...}` and made the function suspending. Subsequently I converted every function that calls these function suspending as well, all the way to the top (meaning to my rest endpoints). This means that 90% of my functions are now suspending. This seems like a lot of `suspend` keywords. Is this the way to go? Or should I have only made the IO layer suspending and used `launch` or `async` somewhere in between? Or alternatively, is there a way to tell the project that just every function is suspending so that you don't have to repeat this keyword over and over again?
3. I had to wrap my tests in `runBlockingTest {...}` from `kotlinx-coroutines-test` as all my functions are now suspending. This mostly worked great and I didn't have to modify much else. The only thing that bugged me is the following:   
`assertThrows(InvalidValueException::class.java) {`  
`runBlocking { service.doSomething(faultyData) }`  
`}`  
Here I had to introduce the additional `runBlocking` to make it compile. Is there a way around it? Would this be better with different test libraries besides JUnit?
4. I'm writing and reading csv files with `apache-commons-csv` which is blocking. I haven't looked around yet to find a non-blocking csv library. As mentioned above I wrapped all the IO calls in `withContext(`[`Dispatchers.IO`](https://Dispatchers.IO)`) {...}` but IntelliJ is still complaining about `inappropriate blocking method call`s. What should you do about it in case there is no non-blocking library to use?

897,2020-12-18 17:36:03,3,0,"# How it started

Everyone knows that this year 2020 has been challenging to all of us. For the past 2 years, I have been working as a Food Delivery partner in a private company. when the Lockdown was announced we all had lots, during that time I decided to perceive my dream of becoming an **#Android developer**, so I started searching for resources, in 2017 IO google announced their official support for **#Kotlin** for there android platform, so I decided to learn kotlin for android development,

# Love at first sight

It was *love at first sight* for me with the Kotlin, when I came to know that Kotlin is not only for android and you can do **Multiplatform development, server-side development, web Frontend and even data science**. I started learning from the documentation but, that was not enough there is no path and no implementation of your learning in the documentations, Then I came to know about Jetbrains academy,

&amp;#x200B;

# Finally found the right one

what would be a better place other then the makers of Kotlin,  So I chose the Kotlin developer track and started learning in the JetBrain Academy, Finally I found the best resource to learn Kotlin, there were lots of projects categorised into four sections **easy, medium, Hard and  Challenging** you are free to choose any track your curriculum will be curated based on your selection, I took the hard one, now the project will be divided into 4 to 5 small peace, say for example if your project is arranging a PhoneBook, in the initial stage you learn the basics of programming and in the 2^(nd) stage, you learn the concepts that are required for the project like writing and reading a file. In the next stage, you will learn about different sorting algorithms needed to sort the contacts, by the end of each stage you would have completed a portion of your project and at the final stage, you would have built the whole project.

The courses are fun, challenging at times. It is curated in a way that you have to search through some documentation and find some missing pieces as the professional software developers do, this is intentionally done so that you will know where to look if get stuck.

In a month I completed my first project and learned a ton in that single Project, looking back at that now in a single month I had built a real-world project and learned Kotlin along the way, it has given me tremendous confidence that has to lead me to become a professional Android Developer.

The things that I love about JetBrains Academy is that in their track there is a thing called Daily challenge which is a basically a simple quiz or task to recall the concept you learned, It is amazing because it not only helps you recall the concept but will improve your programming skill, every 24 hours you will get a new challenge you will be rewarded with germs for solving the daily challenges, it's like collecting coins in a game, it's fun too, currently I have 504 coins. you also get 100 germs for completing a project.

I'm currently looking for a typed language to build CLI tools easy to deploy and relatively efficient. Kotlin syntax really seduced me with its elegance and Clickt as a lib in particular is appealing, but some points are still pending for my investment on it,  regarding the status and the future of this language.

* OK, the legacy of the Java platform could not be erased so easily, but in 2020 Maven and Gradle are  a bit outdated in the era of pip, npm, cargo and others. Could we expect a decent package manager focused on Native ?
* In the same vein, it's never clear when libraries are targeting the JVM or Native, neither to unearth them. Is there a package repository somewhere. I'm not against  the [awesome lists](https://github.com/bipinvaylu/awesome-kotlin-native) but today this is a required to build a community.

Hier geht es darum wie ich die “[Persistance Library Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)” verwende um die GPS Daten in der App zu verwalten.

## Room

Jetzt muss ich über das Haupt Feature dieser App reden. Es sollen Wege auf der Landkarte angezeigt werden. Die bestehen aus einer langen Reihe von GPS Punkten. Diese Daten muss ich wo speichern. Beim Wandern hat man nicht immer eine Internetverbindung, darum müssen die Daten lokal in der App liegen. Die einfachste Variante ist, die Daten einfach in einem Textdokument abzulegen. So habe ich das in den bisherigen Apps gemacht. Am liebsten würde ich eigentlich die Firebase Datenbank verwenden, aber das geht ja nicht. Das geht nur mit Internetverbindung. Um auf dem Gebiet aber auch was neues zu lernen habe ich mich für “[Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)” entschieden.

Das ist der momentan empfohlene Weg Daten persistent zu speichern. [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) ist eine etwas einfachere Methode eine SQL Datenbank zu verwenden. Ich kann jetzt nicht wirklich sagen, dass ich alles verstanden habe, wie das funktioniert. Ich hab einfach mal das [Tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-room-with-a-view-kotlin/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) gemacht und das dann so abgeändert, dass es zu meinen Daten passt. Die Daten sind so aufgebaut: Es gibt mehrere Wegabschnitte, die haben einen Namen und eine Liste mit Wegpunkten. Die Daten liegen in der App gebundled in einem json file mit 30.000 Zeilen. Wenn die App gestartet wird, werden mit der [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) Library die Daten eingelesen und in die Datenbank mit “INSERT” eingefüllt, falls sie noch nicht da sind. Diese Daten bleiben in weiterer Folge persistent. 

Als nächstes schreibt man dann eine DAO Klasse. Das ist sowas wie ein Übersetzer von setter und getter Funktionen zu SQL Queries. Ich erfinde also zum Beispiel eine Funktion: getSelectedTitles() und darüber kann man mit einer Annotation schreiben welches SQL Statement das ausführen soll. In meinem Fall: “SELECT title FROM weg\_table WHERE selected”. Das liefert mir dann eine Liste mit ausgewählten Wegen. Diese DAO Funktionen kann man dann im Grunde im ViewModel verwenden um damit eine Liste zu befüllen. 

Ja, so funktioniert das im Grunde. Ich habe schon ein paar Abende daran gearbeitet, bis es das gemacht hat was ich wollte. Aber ab dann musste ich mich nicht mehr darum kümmern. Es funktioniert. Mir gefällt es auch das Ding zu verwenden das aktuell von den Android Göttern empfohlen wird. Dann kann es schon nicht so falsch sein.",So verwende ich die Room Datenbank

However I'm finding it extremely hard to find a proper way to use Reactjs with Ktor.

If I go the multiplatform route, I found this project that I believe is the most up to date one to use as a starting point: https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Full%20Stack%20Web%20App%20with%20Kotlin%20Multiplatform/01_Introduction (there's also this one https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-full-stack-application-demo but it seems a bit more outdated). However I see a major problem, namely that I would not be able to use any UI library such as React Material UI or React Bootstrap with it because they have not been adapted to kotlin yet. Which is a major show stopper because:

* at the moment I'm going to work on the project alone and I need ready to use components to speed up the implementation
* I don't want to invest hours in trying to adapt the UI library of choice to kotlin on my own and then waste time running after obscure bugs

Since it seems that the full stack option is still in its infancy I'm also trying to figure out if I could go the Ktor + typescript Reactjs route. But I could not find any information about it or any example on how to bundle everything together using gradle. I believe this is partly due to the fact that JetBrains is pushing the full kotlin route and discouraging mixed solutions so I'm turning to you to get some pointers.

919,2021-01-06 02:07:20,10,1,"Hi folks, I've been building a simplicity-prioritized web application from the ground-up, with the fewest possible dependencies.  That means I also built a server for this, using Socket and ServerSocket.

It's been of the ordinary blocking kind, and I'm pretty happy.  But not complacent.  Right now I'm doing some research to see if there's any low-hanging fruit in terms of massive speed gains.

The driving business paradigm is that the application is for timekeeping at a company.  If I run the code to add a time entry below the server layer, I can add a million time entries per second (thread-safely! It's atomic indexes and ConcurrentHashMap for the shared mutable state).  However, if I do the equivalent through the server layer, it's down to eleven thousand per second.  Yuck.  Well, I mean it's ok and all, but I want a million if there's some easy way to have it.

One of the big bottlenecks is the back-and-forth of the HTTP protocol, where the server examines the first line to see what it is (GET? POST? etc) and then reads the headers (Does it have a content-length?, Who is this, per the cookie?) and then assembles a response in kind.  It also complicates things that I am handling keep-alive as well.  That means the client might decide to stay on the socket for the next back-and-forth.

Which leads me to the idea of non-blocking.  If I do that, sure, each individual request/response should be the same performance, but with all that waiting taking place in blocking servers, I would imagine I could parallelize this tremendously and get my million requests per second.

Questions:

- Am I insane?
- Is non-blocking the answer to this?
- I've looked at Ktor's code.  Is there other code that covers similar ground, written in pure Kotlin, test/quality-oriented, that's fast?

Here's the code: https://github.com/7ep/r3z (edited) 

Since it uses Gradle's v6.7 toolchain feature, the only dependency is Java.  You don't even need the JDK, plain SE would do.  you can run all the tests by running gradlew test, and the entire set of tests takes 15 seconds to run.

921,2021-01-06 14:18:46,28,1,"Hi! I've been developing some small web app in Spring lately. I just started wondering, how do you people handle mapping objects, especially requests into entities. E.g.:

\`\`\`kotlin

data class TitleCreateRequest(

val title: String,

)

\`\`\`

into:

\`\`\`kotlin

\\@Document(""titles"")

data class Title(

val title: String,

var id: String?

)

\`\`\`

Most of the time I use extension functions like:

\`\`\`\`kotlin

fun TitleCreateRequest.toDomain() = Title(title = this.title)

\`\`\`\`

and I think this is pretty expressive in code, especially that I use this in whole project. But I started wondering: I somehow make \`TitleCreateRequest\` responsible for creation of another (more important?) object. Change in \`Title\` may require change in that extension function which is probably somewhere else than in \`Title.kt\` file.  On the other hand I actually expose \`Title\` primary constructor like that.

What do you think about defining secondary constructor in \`Title\`?

\`\`\`kotlin

\\@Document(""titles"")

data class Title(

val title: String,

var id: String?

) {

constructor(request: TitleCreateRequest) : this(title = request.title)

}

\`\`\`

The other way around mapping – from entity to dto – I think extension function is the best, because it is entity's responsibility to define how it should be presented publicly.

I'm sure this is not news for those who have used kotest extensively, but for someone learning kotlin and trying out different kotlin-based testing libs it might be, so thought I'd share this.

The gist of it is - you can generate tests dynamically within loops, therefore avoiding the need to write duplicated code in some cases. In my case it probably saved me a couple thousand of lines of test code for integration tests.

So here's an example of what you can do:

```

someConditions.forEach { testCondition -&gt; // let's say we have a collection of 10 conditions we want to test

    it(""test $testCondition"") { // note that you need to somehow make the test names unique

        // your test and assertion goes here

    }

}

```

The above code will create 10 different tests for you. Of course it might not be applicable for everything, but it can also save you some time for testing your stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

And here's a real-life example of how I'm using this neat feature for some integration tests - [https://github.com/serpro69/kotlin-faker](https://github.com/serpro69/kotlin-faker/blob/master/core/src/test/kotlin/io/github/serpro69/kfaker/FakerIT.kt#L34-L93)

It looks a bit messy due to 3 extra indentation layers - I want to assert all my tests at the end, hence there's an `assertSoftly` block; and then I also need to iterate over the functions I'm calling with reflection. But it works and it saved me a ton of time for both writing and maintaining integration tests :) Any suggestions how to improve upon this idea are also welcome :)",2k tests with 100 lines of code - dynamic test generation with kotest

942,2021-01-20 17:40:08,16,1,"I realize this should be a blog post or something, but I don't have a blog and don't really want one...

I recently read [this](https://www.pacoworks.com/2018/02/25/simple-dependency-injection-in-kotlin-part-1/) and [this](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/patterns/dependency_injection/), and it really got me thinking about how I think about abstraction and dependencies in Kotlin.

So, I did an experiment by (partially) implementing some features in a few different ways. The domain types are `Child`, `Parent`, and `Family`. We have a `ChildRepository`, `ParentRepository`, and a `FamilyService` that uses the two repositories to do stuff to family units. The canonical implementation of the repositories uses a `Connection` to write to persistence. The `Connection` is an interface in my example, rather than a class, which comes into play in a couple of the implementations I wrote.

Here I'll post links to the code and what I see as the good and bad of each.

# Example 1. OOP style interfaces

[gist](https://gist.github.com/ragnese/4b0c010b7810864f28fb54c45e11dd01)

I define the base interfaces `ParentRepository`, `ChildRepository`, `FamilyService`. Then instead of defining a class that implements each interface, I just define another interface that requires a `Connection` field and override the interface methods with implementations. Now, to get an instance of ParentRepository, you just have to create an object that implements ConnParentRepository, which only requires the Connection field. Similar to a class with a Connection field.

What's nice about this approach vs. the class approach, is that you can have one object implement multiple interfaces with a single Connection reference, instead of having multiple concrete class objects each holding a reference to the same Connection object. Except...

That it doesn't actually work if your interfaces don't play nicely, as you can see with the ConnFamilyService. ChildRepository and ParentRepository are not compatible because the signatures on some methods clash. Since we're in control of the interfaces, we *could* just rename the methods to be more verbose and ugly. But I'm leaving it this way in case there's a scenario where that's not possible or appropriate.

So to implement `ConnFamilyService`, we have to be a bit kludgy. There are now three object references in the interface instead of the ideal of one. Still better than composing classes, though. If you had a ChildRepositoryImpl, ParentRepositoryImpl, and FamilyServiceImpl, you'd end up with four references inside the FamilyServiceImpl. This really doesn't matter much for this example, but things could get worse for complex hierarchies.

What I don't love about this is that FamilyService::addChild doesn't actually require a ParentRepository, but if you wanted to call it, you'd have to supply a ParentRepository anyway.

# Example 2: OOP style interfaces abusing Connection interface

[gist](https://gist.github.com/ragnese/6f0471c160b5085ea6dbb598c7bc49c0)

The difference here is that I don't treat Connection like a field anymore. Since it's an interface, I just chuck it up into the interface dependencies.

The ConnFamilyService still suffers from the same fundamental issue as the first example. The implementation is slightly nicer, but it's back up to four references inside anyway.

It feels a little wrong, though, because the connection isn't really ""part of"" the functionality. It's just a thing used to *implement* the functionality.

# Example 3: ""Functional"" approach- just extend Connection directly

[gist](https://gist.github.com/ragnese/2c99d5cc72ac3b02a5ffe73f1bff817a)

This one is the shortest and most direct. The functionality is namespaced by being inside of objects. Those objects ""power up"" the Connection with new functionality that is only available inside the scope of the object. So you can only access the extension functions if you import e.g., ParentRepository.put or if you use a Kotlin scoping function like ParentRepository.run {}.

The thing that I miss from this approach is that there is no more abstract interface to describe the functionality. I can't just ask for something ""that operates as a ParentRepository"", because there isn't that. It's all implemented strictly in terms of the Connection. I suppose for ""interfaces"" I could just typealias `(id: ID) -&gt; Parent` and request that instead of an interface.

On the flip side, it's very modular/composable and requires no ceremony.

# Example 4: ""Functional"" approach with explicit dependencies

[gist](https://gist.github.com/ragnese/114e5e3bd60a7a62bb4a5c218c01adcb)

What if we abstract it a bit, so that the extensions aren't on the Connection directly, but on ""some object that has all the dependencies""? This would work better if we needed more than just a Connection to perform these operations.

Notice how each ""feature"" now has its own type required for its operations and how FamilyServiceDependencies is built by just composing the other dependencies. Also notice that FamilyService.addChild only requires ChildRepositoryDependencies!! So, if you wanted to use the FamilyService to add a child to a family, you wouldn't need anything from the ParentRepository functionality. If they had different underlying dependencies, this would matter.

# Example 5: Same as #4, but even more explicit

[gist](https://gist.github.com/ragnese/54fa82e93a0d6878c68691e4075c1820)

Same thing, but changed FamilyServiceDependencies to be more explicit about its dependencies.

# Example 6: Same as #4, but move Connection into interface

[gist](https://gist.github.com/ragnese/4c3a19363e5217bd0748534359cd7edb)

Same as #4 but with Connection as part of the interfaces, like #2. Definitely short, and modular. Ticks a lot of boxes, but still makes me uneasy to put a dependency in the interface like that.

So that's it. I feel like Kotlin gives us a lot of options for creating and composing abstractions, and I'm just trying out new stuff. In all cases, I like the idea of avoiding concrete class implementations in favor of interfaces with dependencies.

I also like the idea of doing ""dependency injection"" by grouping all dependencies and then writing an extension function on the dependencies.

Repositories may not have been the best example, because you might really want that to be a regular interface like in examples 1 and 2. But for other abstractions the other approaches might make sense. Or a mix and match. Maybe you implement the Repositories as interfaces, but the FamilyService functions are extension functions that depend on Repositories.

[https://github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-kotlin](https://github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-kotlin)

The above seem interesting though they seem to be not maintained anymore. I do know about Akka(more Scala) but it has no pre-emptive scheduling which is a deal breaker.

I see Kotlin has some inbuilt support for actors, but I can't seem to find anything related to storing and referencing actors through process Ids. Any direction here would be helpful",Anyone using any Actor Frameworks for Kotlin?
952,2021-01-28 17:30:46,3,1,"Naming things is hard. And naming tests is no exception. But XCTest adds another layer of complexity: test names have to be functions.

The framework creates a test for every function that starts with “test” in your `XCTestCase` subclass. Examples from [Apple’s docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/defining_test_cases_and_test_methods) include:

```swift
class NetworkReachabilityTests: XCTestCase {
    func testUnreachableURLAccessThrowsAnError()
    func testUserJSONFeedParsing()
}
```

I find these a bit hard to understand. Humans weren’t meant to read camel case, that’s why we have spaces! I would much rather write tests like Kotlin, as a string.

```kotlin
class MyTestCase {
     @Test fun `number of cells with no data is zero`()
}
```

Turns out, we can get something very close to this Swift, but there are a few tradeoffs. Add the following extension to your test suite.

```swift
extension XCTestCase {
    func test&lt;T&gt;(_ description: String, block: () throws -&gt; T) rethrows -&gt; T {
        try XCTContext.runActivity(named: description, block: { _ in try block() })
    }
}
```

We are taking advantage of [`XCTActivity`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctcontext) to wrap everything in “test” with some syntactic sugar. Now we can write tests like this!

```swift
class TestCase: XCTestCase {
    func test_numberOfCells() throws {
        test(""is zero when there is no data"") {
            /* ... */
        }

        test(""is equal to the number of items"") {
            /* ... */
        }
    }
}
```

I really like how this reads. It’s obvious what’s going on and each assertion gets its own space to breath. However, there are a few downsides to this approach.

### How do you test?

Looking ahead, I’d love to create a micro-library that can generate tests on the fly. Think Quick, but without any of the nesting or BDD stuff.

What do you use to test your Swift code? Do you use any third-party libraries? I’d love to know! [Mention or DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/joemasilotti) to get in touch.

When I replace the non-blocking delay() method from the example with sleep() it turns out that coroutines are executed in the same thread sequentially. I found a solution to pass the Dispatchers.Default argument to async() function [(coroutines are executed parallel in this case)](https://imgur.com/a/TCYO1ft), but Kotlin's documentation says the following

&gt;[Dispatchers.Default](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-dispatchers/-default.html) — is used by all standard builders if no dispatcher or any other [ContinuationInterceptor](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.coroutines/-continuation-interceptor/index.html) is specified in their context. It uses a common pool of shared background threads. This is an appropriate choice for compute-intensive coroutines that consume CPU resources.

        System.out.println(desc + "":"");

        Integer i1 = value;                             // [1]
        Integer i2 = value;
        show(""Automatic"", i1, i2);
        // Old way, deprecated in Java 9 and on:
        Integer r1 = new Integer(value);                // [2]
        Integer r2 = new Integer(value);
        show(""new Integer()"", r1, r2);
        // Preferred in Java 9 and on:
        Integer v1 = Integer.valueOf(value);            // [3]
        Integer v2 = Integer.valueOf(value);
        show(""Integer.valueOf()"", v1, v2);
        // Primitives can't use equals():
        int x = value;                                  // [4]
        int y = value;
        // x.equals(y); // Doesn't compile
        System.out.println(""Primitive int:"");
        System.out.printf(""%d==%d %b%n"", x, y, x == y);
      }
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        test(127);
        test(128);
      }
    }
    /* Output:

    Primitive int:

    */


The `show()` method compares the behavior of `==` to the method `equals()` that
exists for all objects. The `printf()` format argument uses the specifier `%d`
for `int` output, `%b` for Boolean output, and `%n` to produce a newline.

If you need a ""not equal"" comparison, use `n1 != n2` and  `!n1.equals(n2)`.

In `test()`, you see integer-valued objects created in four different ways:

- **[1]**: Automatic conversion to `Integer`.
- **[2]**: Using standard `new` object-creation syntax. This *was* the preferred
  way to create ""wrapped"" `Integer` objects.
- **[3]**: Starting with Java 9, `valueOf()` is preferred over **[2]**. If you
  try to use form **[2]** with Java 9, you'll get a warning and a suggestion to
  use **[3]** instead. It is difficult to determine whether **[3]** is preferred
  over **[1]**, and **[1]** seems much cleaner.
- **[4]**: As primitive `int`s.

The `@SuppressWarnings(""deprecation"")` is not necessary for Java 8, but is
included in case you compile the code with Java 9 or newer.

For a `value` of 127, the comparisons produce the results you expect, *except*
form **[2]** which produces `false` for `==` and `true` for `equals()`. Although
the *contents* of the objects are the same, the references point to different
objects in memory. The operators `==` and `!=` compare object references, and
have different behavior *depending on how the `Integer` objects are
created*---presumably, **[1]** and **[3]** yield `Integer`s that point to the
same storage in memory. `Integer` values from -128 through 127 produce this
behavior for `==` and `!=`, but outside that range they will not, as seen with
the call `test(128)`.

If you're using `Integer` you must only use `equals()`. If you accidentally use
`==` and `!=` for `Integer` and don't test it for values outside -128 through
127, your code will pass but will be quietly broken. If you're using primitive
`int`s then you *can't* use `equals()` and *must* use `==` and `!=`. This can
cause problems if you start by using `int`s and then later change to `Integer`s,
or vice-versa.

In Java 9 and on, the use of `new Integer()` is deprecated to eliminate this
issue. Think about that. Java has included this very odd behavior for *two
decades* before acknowledging it was a mistake.

When working with floating-point numbers, you encounter different equivalence
problems, not because of Java but because of the nature of floating-point
numbers:

    // operators/DoubleEquivalence.java

    public class DoubleEquivalence {
      static void show(String desc, Double n1, Double n2) {
        System.out.println(desc + "":"");
        System.out.printf(
          ""%e==%e %b %b%n"", n1, n2, n1 == n2, n1.equals(n2));
      }
      @SuppressWarnings(""deprecation"")
      public static void test(double x1, double x2) {
        // x1.equals(x2) // Won't compile
        System.out.printf(""%e==%e %b%n"", x1, x2, x1 == x2);
        Double d1 = x1;
        Double d2 = x2;
        show(""Automatic"", d1, d2);
        Double r1 = new Double(x1);
        Double r2 = new Double(x2);
        show(""new Double()"", r1, r2);
        Double v1 = Double.valueOf(x1);
        Double v2 = Double.valueOf(x2);
        show(""Double.valueOf()"", v1, v2);
      }
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        test(0, Double.MIN_VALUE);
        test(Double.MAX_VALUE,
          Double.MAX_VALUE - Double.MIN_VALUE * 1_000_000);
      }
    }
    /* Output:
    0.000000e+00==4.900000e-324 false
    Automatic:
    0.000000e+00==4.900000e-324 false false
    new Double():
    0.000000e+00==4.900000e-324 false false
    Double.valueOf():
    0.000000e+00==4.900000e-324 false false

    new Double():
    1.797693e+308==1.797693e+308 false true
    Double.valueOf():
    1.797693e+308==1.797693e+308 false true
    */

On paper, the comparison of floating point numbers should be very strict---a
number that is the tiniest fraction different from another number should still
be unequal. This works for the call to `test(0, Double.MIN_VALUE)`, where
`Double.MIN_VALUE` is the smallest representable value. (`%e` in the `printf()`
call presents the results in exponential notation).

However, it does not hold true for the second `test()` call, where the argument
`x2` is the value of `x1` minus one million times `Double.MIN_VALUE`. It seems
like `x2` should be significantly different than `x1`, but the two numbers still
compare as equal. You encounter this kind of problem in virtually every
programming language because when a variable holds a very large number,
subtracting a relatively small number won't make a significant difference. This
is called a *rounding error* and occurs because the machine cannot hold enough
information to represent a tiny change to a large number.

You might be fooled into thinking that using `==` produces a correct result in
this case, but it does not---it is simply comparing references.

Using `equals()` when you're not working with primitives seems like the
straightforward answer, but it's not as simple as that. Consider class `ValA`:


    // operators/EqualsMethod.java
    // Default equals() does not compare contents

    class ValA {
      int i;
    }

    class ValB {
      int i;
      // Works for this example, not a complete equals():
      public boolean equals(Object o) {
        ValB rval = (ValB)o;  // Cast o to be a ValB
        return i == rval.i;
      }
    }

    public class EqualsMethod {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        ValA va1 = new ValA();
        ValA va2 = new ValA();
        va1.i = va2.i = 100;
        System.out.println(va1.equals(va2));
        ValB vb1 = new ValB();
        ValB vb2 = new ValB();
        vb1.i = vb2.i = 100;
        System.out.println(vb1.equals(vb2));
      }
    }
    /* Output:
    false
    true
    */


In `main()`, `va1` and `va2` contain identical values for `i`, but the result of
comparing them using `equals()` is `false`, which is confusing again. This
happens because the default behavior of `equals()` is to compare references. To
produce the desired behavior of comparing the contents, you must *override*
`equals()` as in class `ValB`. `ValB.equals()` contains only the minimum
necessary code to solve the problem for this example, but it is not a proper
`equals()`. Note that the standard argument for `equals()` is an `Object` (not a
`ValB`), so we must force `o` to be a `ValB` using a *cast*: `(ValB)o`
(ordinarily you must check the type first before casting, but we'll skip that
until a later chapter). Then we can compare the two values of `i`, using `==`
because they are primitives.

Most of the standard library classes override `equals()` to compare the contents
of objects instead of their references.

I tried everything to better understand how those interfaces work. I looked at all the official formats (JSON, HOCON, CBOR, Properties) and at a lot of third-party format implementations, like YAML or BSON (which is probably the best reference because it is closest to the format I am implementing).

Still, it seems opaque to me. The official implementations use `NamedValueEncoder`, which is an internal class not meant to be used from the outside. The third-party solutions mostly use `AbstractEncoder` and mostly just encode the values without the names in `Encoder`. Which makes no sense taken out of context. I suppose there has to be some point at which these values get their corresponding names, but I don't know where that happens.

I'm also struggling to understand how the `Encoder` / `CompositeEncoder` interaction plays out. And `encodeSerializableValue()` / `encodeSerializableElement()` also seems weird to me. For some reason, this is the only point where a name for the value is retrieved (and, at some point encoded) in most of the implementations so far.

I think what would really help me is if someone could walk me through the exact routine that gets executed when you serialize and encode a basic data class, with a few levels of nesting.

But really I'd be glad for any kind of help, since I am stuck here for days now and I don't really know what to do anymore.

988,2021-03-05 07:09:16,10,1,"I have a couple job offers that are in golang and 1 in kotlin. I have about 2-3 years of experience with golang, but no experience with jvm languages. (Also have some python experience). Curious about how much time it would take to learn kotlin on the job, especially from those that transitioned without much jvm experience.

I'm trying to improve my work life balance (preferably not much more than 40 hours a week average including learning), and want to focus on building things over learning languages to be honest, and afraid it will take a significant amount of time to ramp up with kotlin. I've heard great things about kotlin, esp from java engineers, but my concern is not with how awesome the language is, but with the amount of effort it would take to learn it all. More to explain this next.

There are lots of constructs and operators that look quite foreign to me (see code snippet below), and I'm wondering how much Java would I also have to learn in addition (due to java libraries), as kotlin seems somewhat connected to java. Lastly, I'd also need to learn intellij or some other IDE, as I've lived in the VIM world for a few years. That is to say, lots and lots to learn, an entire ecosystem. Gotta also learn the build systems, etc... like gradle? It seems like tons to learn and months of work (inside and outside of working hours).

How much time can I expect it take to onboard with kotlin to a proficient level? This is assuming I learn during work hours and don't have weekends and weeknights to learn the language. I'm a bit concerned b/c I prefer to hit the ground running a bit faster, as all offers are for senior level positions. I'm early 30's with about 3-4 years of experience as a developer (previously SRE/devops).

I was a bit intimidated by looking at just ""two sum"" on leetcode (ie. really simple code). I could barely understand it without spending a few minutes googling stuff. Wrote some comments with some thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

    class Solution {
        fun twoSum(nums: IntArray, target: Int): IntArray {
            
            // wow, really prefer golang and python literals or constructs.
            // e.g. m := make(map[string]int) or 
            // map[string]int{&lt;...&gt;}
            val diffMap = mutableMapOf&lt;Int, Int&gt;()
            
            // for each element? (index, and int), similar to python enumerated
            // why are there so many camel case methods or functions? 
            nums.forEachIndexed { index, int -&gt; 
                
                // if the integer exists within the diffMap, return the indices. 
                diffMap[int]?.let { // let is kind of funky. looks like javascript.
                    return intArrayOf(it, index) // ""it"" is like a lambda variable? so weird to do this just to get the value from a map. 
                }
                
                // add diff to map
                // I really like this. No extra camel case function to learn.
                // This is the only part of the code that seems similar to python/golang. 
                diffMap[target - int] = index   
            }
            
            // wish this was just ""[]"". miss the literal slices in golang and python.
            return intArrayOf()
        }
    }

Lastly, kotlin doesn't look to be that popular yet.  I still find it quite risky, especially if kotlin isn't that similar to java (?), and doesn't reduce the amount of work needed to learn java, which I'd have to do if I needed to go to a large megacorp in my area (SF/Bay)

Am I being too opinionated? Am I being accurate in that there will be a ton to learn though? Anyone share my thoughts?

Since the last time I asked a question here much happened. We changed from synchronous stuff to coroutines in more and more of our projects and you guys were such a help for me, to stop wanting back my Scala days and start really using what kotlin was offering.  
We are now researching flows and I again look back at my scala days where we had akka and alpakka, a set of libs that can connect nearly everything as a Source or Sink. But Akka and Alpakka was yesterday, Kotlin flow is tomorrow.

We are now working on small examples that represent most of our use cases, like:

* get something from http, make a call somewhere, send to kafka
* consume from kafka, transform to different stuff, calls to services or db calls, kafka produce
* ...

So, we now use r2dbc, we experiment with reactor-kafka (as flows), but we haven't found something good for JMS, we use scintilla with jms queues.

We really would like to build a flow that consumes jms and then connects to the other workflows we already have.

I haven't found a way to do that, i assume using the flow builder 

    flow {
    
    }

could work if I just use a while(true) with a ""getItemFromQueue"", which is then emitted ... this should work, not very nice but maybe works, but isn't there a better way?

```
Only should print once BUT it print multiple times (!?) --&gt; null
Only should print once BUT it print multiple times (!?) --&gt; null
Only should print once and it prints one time only as expected!
result true
```

The important part in the above println logs is `Only should print once BUT it print multiple times (!?) --&gt; null` is `root == null` is true and we are entering the `if` block, so the function `find()` at once MUST return `true` and exit right?

But what happens it, the code is seemingly ignoring that!! and here is where I am confused!

### Code below:

```kotlin

class TwoSumIV {

    class TreeNode(var `val`: Int = 0) {
        var left: TreeNode? = null
        var right: TreeNode? = null
    }

    fun findTarget(root: TreeNode?, k: Int): Boolean {
        val set: MutableSet&lt;Int?&gt; = HashSet&lt;Int?&gt;()

        return find(root, k, set)

    }

    fun find(root: TreeNode?, k: Int, set: MutableSet&lt;Int?&gt;): Boolean {

        if (root == null) {
            println(""Only should print once BUT it print multiple times (!?) --&gt; ${root?.`val`}"")
            return false
        } else if (set.contains(k - root.`val`)) {
            println(""Only should print once and it prints one time only as expected!"")
            return true
        }

        set.add(root.`val`)

        return find(root.left, k, set) || find(root.right, k, set)
    }
}

fun main() {
    val root = TwoSumIV.TreeNode(5)
    root.left = TwoSumIV.TreeNode(3)
    root.right = TwoSumIV.TreeNode(6)

    println(root)
    val twoSumIV = TwoSumIV()
    val result = twoSumIV.findTarget(root, 9)
    println(""result $result"")
}

I'm trying to find the best way to interact with a filesystem and do basic operations on it (I/O). My requirements would be:  


- multiplatform
- (compatible with) Kotlin v1.4.32
- FS navigation (```Path```)
- Basic I/O (most importantly txt file reading, maybe also writing, creating/deleting)
- Bonus Points if it can be done nonblockingly

What would **not** be needed:

- streaming possibilities
- random access
- control over platform-specific details
- basically anything that is more advanced than basic CRUD

I don't think it's a good idea to wait for ```kotlinx.io```\*, so what could other alternatives be? The last option would be to implement it with `expect` / `actual` for every platform, but maybe there's already a fitting library for this? Maybe korio?

Check out the [documentation](https://nacular.github.io/doodle) and [tutorials](https://nacular.github.io/doodle-tutorials) to learn more.

# Highlights include

## Multi-touch Support
Doodle now supports multiple pointers (i.e. touches) by default. So there is no additional work needed to enable this in apps.

- `PointerInputManager` now tracks a collection of pointers and dispatches events to Views on a per-pointer basis.
- `PointerEvent` now has information about the list of pointers (for the View and overall). This lets handlers support multi-touch.
- `Resizer` now works better with multi-touch.
- Added ability to suppress OS handling of PointerEvent. This is like consume, except it does not affect other app listeners.

## Accessibility Support
This release stabilizes accessibility and brings a lot of new support to items in the [Controls](https://github.com/nacular/doodle/tree/master/Controls) library.

- View now supports [`accessibilityLabel`](https://github.com/nacular/doodle/blob/master/Core/src/commonMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/core/View.kt#L88), [`accessibilityLabelProvider`](https://github.com/nacular/doodle/blob/master/Core/src/commonMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/core/View.kt#L94), [`accessibilityDescriptionProvider`](https://github.com/nacular/doodle/blob/master/Core/src/commonMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/core/View.kt#L102), and [`nextInAccessibleReadOrder`](https://github.com/nacular/doodle/blob/master/Core/src/commonMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/core/View.kt#L110).
- View's `visible` and `enabled` properties are now accessible.
- The following widgets now have accessibility support
  - `ToggleButton`
  - `Switch`
  - `CheckBox`
  - `RadioButton`
  - `HyperLink`
  - `ValueSlider` (including `Slider` `orientation`)
  - `ProgressIndicator`
  - `TextInput`
  - `List`
  - `Tree`
  - `TabbedPanel` via `BasicTabbedPanelBehavior`
- `BasicSpinnerBehavior`, `BasicMutableSpinnerBehavior` now supports up/down arrows.

1030,2021-04-14 06:07:47,11,1,"A recent post complaining about `?.` and suggesting `!!` as a replacement was roundly rejected in the comments. No complaints from me there, but it got me thinking about when it is OK to use `!!` in our code. Here's what I could come up with. I don't code for a living, so I'm much more interested in knowing why I'm wrong rather than being right.

I. In testing. Several commenters in the aforementioned post stated that this is the **only** idiomatic usage of `!!` in code. I (gently) disagree; otherwise I wouldn't be posting. But it makes sense to me to use them here. You have unusually strong control over the input; it's not user-facing; and failing fast is good.

II. Working with third-party libraries. I snagged this example from [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/kotlin/not-null-assertion):

For example, let’s say we’re using bean validation annotations on a Spring DTO:

    data class NewUserDto(     
        @get:NotNull
        val username: String? = null 
    )

Spring automatically applies the validation rules to the request data. Therefore, after the validation is done, we’re sure that the *username* is not *null*:

    val request: NewUserDto = // from controller userService.registerUser(request.username!!)

Even though we do know the value is not *null* from the context, the Kotlin compiler has no way to infer this information. So, we have to use the *!!* operator here.

III. Where the code is built around it. I'm not so sure about this one. Here's an example from the core library (the Kotlin `Regex` class):

    public actual fun replace(input: CharSequence, transform: (MatchResult) -&gt; CharSequence): String {
        var match: MatchResult? = find(input) ?: return input.toString()
    
        var lastStart = 0
        val length = input.length
        val sb = StringBuilder(length)
        do {
            val foundMatch = match!!
            sb.append(input, lastStart, foundMatch.range.start)
            sb.append(transform(foundMatch))
            lastStart = foundMatch.range.endInclusive + 1
            match = foundMatch.next()
        } while (lastStart &lt; length &amp;&amp; match != null)
    
        if (lastStart &lt; length) {
            sb.append(input, lastStart, length)
        }
    
        return sb.toString()
    }

Here, `foundMatch` can never be null because it's only defined in a loop where the underlying `match` variable has already been null-checked. Of course, one could try to find some cromulent `?:` default value or break the loop, but 1) it seems silly to put in all this failsafe code for something that should not fail; and 2) this seems like a good way to let in a subtle bug that might not be noticed for a long time, in part of the API that is commonly used for validation. Perhaps it makes sense to let it fail fast and even catastrophically in production code?",Idiomatic !!

The second issue is that I need to decompress files with either ""bzip2"" or ""lz4"" type compression.  These are a little bit odd formats as they are not widely used by the web, like gzip.

# Shipping Calculator

You are working on a eCommerce website and need to make a shipping cost calculator based on the order amount.  
The store uses the following cost structure:  
For orders in the US:  
\- $75+ orders have free shipping  
\- orders less than $75 have a shipping fee of 10% of the total order amount.  
For international orders, there is a 15% shipping fee, with a maximum of $50. This means that the maximum shipping fee for an international order is $50.  
You need to complete the given **shippingCost**() function, which takes the order amount and a Boolean indicating whether the order is international or not, and returns the shipping cost for that order.  
The return amount should be a **Double**.  
**Sample Input:**  
140.0  
true  
**Sample Output:**  
21.0  
 

 and my proposed solution:

 

fun shippingCost(amount: Double, international: Boolean): Double {  
 val shippingCost:Double = 0.0  
 if (international = True){//International shipping structure  
        shippingCost = ((amount/100.0)\*15)}  
 if (shippingCost &gt;= 50.0){  
        shippingCost = 50.0  
 }  
 else{continue}  
 else{ //US shipping structure  
 if(amount &gt;= 75.0){  
        shippingCost = 0.00  
 }  
 else{

* Procedural programming 
* Complete knowledge and understanding of Kotlin 
* Null safety 
* Objects, classes, and abstract classes 
* Website back-end scripting 
* Developing Android app
* Functional programming 
* Debugging and testing programs written in Kotlin

1090,2021-05-22 21:36:39,8,1,"Hi everyone!

I was working on a project and found myself needing the ability to roll dice. After writing a small library for just that purpose, I thought I'd share it in case anyone else may have similar needs.

A few notes:

\- This is my very first time sharing any kind of code, so feedback is very welcome.

\- The library currently only deals with numerical dice.

\- The library currently only works with dice for which each number is equally probable (i.e., no duplicate faces).

\- The library does not use a cryptographically secure number generator, as the goal is to approximate randomness while still maintaining performance.

Other than that, it is pretty straightforward. It allows the user to create a Die object with a given lower bound and upper bound, add an optional list of modifiers that are applied to each roll, and roll as many times as needed. It also supports both synchronous and suspendable versions of the rolling functions.

In any case, I hope this is useful to someone. I do plan to add a few features (i.e., dice with duplicate faces, non-numerical dice), but I also intend to keep the library small.

From my understanding, if the new IR BE is done properly, there should be no reason, or actually no _way_ for the new FE to differentiate between platforms. I thought the idea behind the IR is to separate FE and BE completely, so that they work independently.

So, why would the Alpha release of the new FE only work on JVM if it solely produces the IR which can then be processed by any BE?",[from the Kotlin roadmap] Why will the alpha release of the new Compiled Frontend be only available on KCMO?

Whenever I tried to learn these languages or new languages I always was thinking 'I could do this much easier in python.\` Python is just so nice to work with that it makes me not want to use anything else. And with no need to use anything else that means there is no drive to learn anything else. 

Most recently while I was trying to learn go I attempted to make a caeser cipher encoder/decoder. I went about this by using a slice containing the alphabet and then collecting a step. My plan was then to find the index of a letter in the code string in the slice then shift that index accordingly. In python I would simply just use `.index`. But after some research and asking questions I found that go doesn't support generics (currently) and in order to replicate this functionality I would have to use a binary sort on a sorted slice.

Python also does small quality of life things that just come with it being dynamically typed. Like when initializing variables in for loops there is no `i = 0;` etc. On top of all that there is also pip. It is so nice to just `pip install [x]` instead of having to download file then pointing to an executable. Python and pip also allows for pythons to be used for so much. Want to do some web dev? Try django or flask. Interested in AI? How about pytorch.

I guess I'm just trying to say that python is so nice to use as a developer that it makes me not want to use anything else. I'm also really looking for advice on how to over come this, besides just double down and do it.

They key driving principal behind it is that it lets you build powerful Authorization policies without being coupled to a web framework. Authorization rules are key parts of business logic, and you should be able to flip web frameworks/servers without losing those business rules.  


it does however also have a plugin for Ktor which lets you ensure that no route is accidentally allowing non-authorized access.  


We are using it in the highest form of ""Production"" we have so far, but is not fully battle tested in the wild yet. Given this is a critical part of a platforms security, possibly it is best used experimentally for now? But, opening it up to usage is a great way to spot bugs and fix them.

Intellij only has this option to create a project, by using gradle build system, and I find this cumbersome. Like all I want is Main.kt and run the project using kotlinc.

I did start out with command line. I'm also an avid vim user. So I wrote the code in vim, executed using command line (kotlinc) and voila, I was able to run projects in Kotlin.

Each Kotlin library depends on the specific version of Kotlin. What happens when the library upgrades its Kotlin dependency and does not provides any backporting?

Imagine, there is a library that depends on Kotlin `1.4.21`. The author of this open-source library does not have a lot of free time, so they do the best they can. In the next release, they fix several issues that bother users so much. Meanwhile, there is a new version of Kotlin available, so the author decides to also upgrade the Kotlin dependency to `1.5.20`.

Does it mean the (production) projects that depend on this library *must* migrate to Kotlin 1.5.20 to benefit from the fixes? If so, doesn't it mean we are in the vicious cycle of ever-upgrading? What if we can't upgrade the Kotlin version in the production project that easily or that fast?

What are the ways of handling this better as a Kotlin community? As library authors?

P.S.

Current problems: no incremental compilation support, no build for mac/windows becaise jitpack doesn't do that, and probably a ton of bugs :)

Why it's not like any other DI? It uses IR, so it doesn't generate code files - no reruns for compilator. It's as simple as possible: no confusing multibindings, field or method inhections. Only constructor injection, only hardcore.

Notes: 

* The caller doesn't have access to the `tiles` field since it's protected. 
* Methods that mutate the underlying data are only found under the `Mutable` class. 
* There are methods for converting between Immutable &lt;-&gt; Mutable &lt;-&gt; View classes.
* The Immutable class is a deep copy of the original data. So changes to the original data doesn't affect this class.

1153,2021-07-07 23:49:53,5,1,"Usual Kotlin project is pretty heavyweight and involves separate Mave / Gradle and IDE config. Usually it's Android or Server Side server with lots of files etc.

I would like to use Kotlin also for small scripts. Like replacement for Python or even BASH. 

1) So you just write some `play.kt` file in some folder, and then just run it like `kotlin run play.kt` and it runs it. 

2) Sometimes you have a minimal set of dependencies, and say you store it as `/projects/kotlin_std_ext` and you just want to use it in your script (but without involving heavy machinery like Maven / Gradle) an easy way something  like `kotlin run play.kt --lib /projects/kotlin_std_ext`

So, is that possible? And do people use something like that?

P.S.

I know about kotlin scripts, tried it but didn't used. I don't remember exactly why, but there were some issues or limitations, it was not the same as usual kotlin file.",Lightweight scripts-like Kotlin programs?

1157,2021-07-10 10:18:31,13,1,"Hi I am getting into kotlin for android development and have built a simple app to test the places API. I know the HTTP request is returning the data but I have come stuck with libraries that handle the requests.

I started with retrofit but struggled with relevant docs in kotlin. Then tried Fuel which works until I try and iterate over the data object but get `Expected BEGIN_ARRAY but was BEGIN_OBJECT at line 1 column 2 path $` This then lead me to output the response and the object in results is in format:

 `""results"" : [{`

`}]`

Could it be that because I am using google places API that fuel is not working as intended? To sum up can anyone point me in a direction for moving forward with HTTP calls in Kotlin maybe some libraries to try and if google has its own way for deserialising the object data so I can use specific parts returned from the call.",What Http libraries exist for kotlin and do you need one for the places API

1162,2021-07-13 12:28:35,0,1,"Hi folks, I want to present you a small, yet powerful, library ([https://github.com/Lipen/kotlin-satlib](https://github.com/Lipen/kotlin-satlib)) that provides an API for [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem) solvers and implements some common operations for constraint programming, such as: handling finite-domain variables (e.g.: int in a small range; custom enum; set of values), storing named ""variables"" in the context, encoding common logic operations over SAT literals ([Tseytin-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tseytin_transformation), when necessary), declaring cardinality constraints (for now, only Totalizer encoding is supported, but it works pretty well in general), solving AllSAT.

The generic interface of the SAT solver is not based on the standard [IPASIR](https://github.com/biotomas/ipasir) one, but is more pragmatic and user-friendly. It consists of the most commonly used operations performed with the SAT solver:

* you can allocate new literals,
* declare new clauses,
* reset the solver,
* solve the SAT problem itself (including solving under assumptions),
* query the resulting values of literals,
* query the whole model (the solution to the SAT problem) itself.
* Less common operations are implemented in a form of Kotlin extension functions, for example, the aforementioned encodings of logic ops form a DSL.

Alongside with the SAT solver interface and its extensions, \`kotlin-satlib\` provides wrappers for native SAT solvers (these days, most of them are written in C/C++) implemented using JNI technology. Currently, the solvers included are: [MiniSat](http://minisat.se/), [Glucose](https://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/), [Cadical](https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical) and [CryptoMiniSat](https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat). Sadly, \`kotlin-satlib\` won't work out-of-the-box, you have to provide it with some external SAT solver, either in the form of a library or a binary. Luckily, there are build instructions for each of the supported SAT solver, both for Linux and Windows. Checkout the README!

The project itself was originally based on [https://github.com/mmaroti/jnisat](https://github.com/mmaroti/jnisat).

Feel free to leave comments, suggestions and new ideas, I'd really appreciate them all! If you are using SAT solvers programmatically, tell me about your use cases, and I will try to add the useful functionality to kotlin-satlib.",kotlin-satlib: SAT solver wrappers for Kotlin
1163,2021-07-13 14:00:44,7,1,"I'm trying to learn Kotlin and the videos I'm watching tend to introduce concepts one at a time. To me that's not only a very tedious way to learn but also it doesn't stick. I get the concept sure. 

3 + 4 = 7 ""*and if you change the sign to an \* then you'll get 3\*4 =12* ""... duh 

But what about remembering whether i need () brackets or {} brackets etc that's the stuff that doesn't stick so much.  

If I need to for example make an if statement I don't want to have to look up the video again and find the part where they mention if statements just to make sure that I type those couple lines of code correctly. 

I recently was playing around a bit in Excel and something I liked about that is that you can click the function button and it will come up with a list of the most common functions or you can then click a drop down list of categories, some of them being ""Math &amp;Trig"", ""Logical"", ""Statistical"" etc.

Then when you find a function that sounds right or even just sounds interesting you can click on it and enter the things that unction needs right into it and if you're not sure how or it's not working etc there's a button that says ""help on this function""  that does exactly that.

I just really liked the fact that you can see **all** the commands that easily right where you are putting them. I ended up creating a lot of automated cells that change colour and text etc based on what you write into other cells and  I probably wouldn't have done that if I didn't look up that list and I think just playing around seeing what you can and can't do is a much funner way to learn than heres concept 1 heres concept 1a &amp;1b -that you could probably have figured out from concept ,  heres concept 2 etc.

**Background**

I have a sealed class that can be two types:

`sealed class ApiResponse&lt;out T&gt; {`  
 `data class Success&lt;out T&gt;(val response: T) : ApiResponse&lt;T&gt;()`  
 `data class Error(`  
 `val code: Int? = null,`  
`val message: String? = null,`  
`val response: ErrorResponse? = null`  
 `) : ApiResponse&lt;Nothing&gt;()`  
`}`

**Problem**

Casting every time I need to read `response: T` is tedious.

`val networkResponse = getResponse()`

`if(networkResponse is ApiResponse.Success&lt;SomeType&gt;) {}`

&amp;#x200B;

**Solution**

Because of this I decided to use kotlin contract api and wrote function like this.

`u/OptIn(ExperimentalContracts::class)`  
`fun isSuccessful(): Boolean {`  
 `contract {`  
 `returns(true) implies (this@ApiResponse is Success&lt;T&gt;)`  
 `}`  
 `return this is Success&lt;T&gt;`  
`}`

Problem  with this approach is that when I write

 `if (networkResponse.isSuccessful()) {` 

  `//here networkResponse.response is T not SomeType`

1202,2021-08-13 08:46:43,13,1,"I've been experiencing runtime errors while using the new kotlin 1.5 Result value class.

I've migrated a rather large project to 1.5, and started to use the newly stabilized kotlin.Result in my code. However, 1.5.0, 1.5.10, 1.5.20 and 1.5.21 have all caused weird runtime errors, ranging from ClassCastException to NoSuchMethodError. Even updating to 1.5.30-RC doesn't solve this, although the errors have changed.

I've been having to use a substitute class to fix my issues:

    sealed class Outcome2&lt;out T&gt; {
    	abstract val value: T
    	abstract val error: Throwable?
    	private data class Success&lt;out T&gt;(

    	}
    
    	private data class Failure(
    		override val error: Throwable
    		): Outcome2&lt;Nothing&gt;() {

    		fun failure(exception: Throwable): Outcome&lt;Nothing&gt; = Failure(exception)
    	}
    }

The above sealed class (with appropriate extension functions) works just like a Result.

Along with Java and C++, Kotlin is a programming language for Android. According to Google, more than 50% of professional Android app developers use Kotlin to develop their Android applications. Meaning that, it is one of the most loved programming languages worldwide. Besides, it is also expected that Kotlin may even change how Java is used on the server. 

Means,if you are an android developer or going to develop android app,  you must know the Kotlin programming language for effective apps development. The best advantage of Kotlin is lesser number of lines of code. Along with this, there are many more useful kotlin features that you should know if you are going to develop an android app. Here we’ll discuss those important features but before digging to it, let’s see the benefits of Kotlin over Java.

## Benefits Of Kotlin Over Java-

Kotlin is designed by JetBrains to overcome the challenges of Java. And hence, gradually it is replacing Java in ANDROID app development. Here’s a list of benefits of Kotlin over Java.

* **Easy To Maintain-** The statically typed programming language support a wide range of IDEs, importantly Android Studio.
* **Advanced Compiler-** Kotlin has a smart compiler. It can detect errors to compile time and perform a check to reduce runtime errors.
* **Fail-Safe System-** As the code is compact, the chances of error are less. Besides, there are some app crashes and system failures incidents with Kotlin.
* **Interoperability With Java-** It has tools and frameworks compatible with Java.
* **Concise And Clear-** Kotlin for android app development is clear, concise and practical. Kotlin extensions are part of Android Jetpack family which helps to optimize android platform APIs, and Jetpack for Kotlin use.

JetBrains has kept its language design clean and made the syntax simple. Besides, it takes very less time to write the code that improves the developer’s productivity.  As an android developer, you should know these Top 7 Kotlin features that make android app faster, easier and error-free.

## Must Know Kotlin Features For Android App Development

 

### 1. Null Safety In Kotlin-

Each Java developer must have been frustrated by NPE (NullPointerException) at some point in time. Special Null value can be assigned to object reference and NullPointerException, a RuntimeException is thrown when a program tries to use object reference that has null value. Exception can prematurely terminate the program. As Java doesn’t provide any information about the object not created by developer has no null value, during the compilation time it put unnecessary pressure on java developer to keep the program null safe. 

But when you use Kotlin, no need to worry about this. Kotlin has a null-safety feature at the starting age, that is by determining that values will be assigned to the null factor or not. Kotlin’s compiler is powered by null-safe feature which improves run-time Null Point Exceptions encounters.

### 2. Lazy-Loading Feature-

Faster loading time is one of the most important criteria for any quality app and Kotlin’s lazy loading feature takes care of this. While using Kotlin for android development, this feature will help you to minimize the startup time for the app. It loads the initial content faster to reduce startup to reduce startup time while slowly leading other less necessary elements and contents down the page. Because of this lazy loading feature, android developers who work with Kotlin can just give the priority to the primary resources and keep them in main memory to ensure faster loading while keeping others or secondary resources in secondary memories.

### 3. Standard Library Functions-

Developers can use standard library functions offered by Kotlin programming language. It eases implementation of higher-order functions with idiomatic patterns like apply, let, use and so on. Also, it has lost of utilities to work with char and string sequences. Its Extension functions provide query operations for sequences and collections. Kotlin’s JDK classes made working convenient with IO, files, and threading.

### 4. Data Classes In Kotlin-

The need of a class is always argued by programming language designers/makers. Generally, a data class in java contains huge boilerplate code that developers should skip so as to find out the real use of that class. However in Kotlin, Android developers can write the equivalent of the same Java code very simply with less code. So, data classes in Kotlin are known as one of the useful features.

### 5. String Interpolation-

String interpolation is done through string literals having placeholders that are assessed to achieve a result where placeholders are replaced with corresponding values. Mostly string handling in Java is difficult, that include the use of plus operators, String.format, and StringBuffer. The simple process of String interpolation in Kotlin becomes complex for Java developers.

Know the amazing IDEs and Text Editors at- [**Kotlin IDEs And Text Editors That You Must Know**](https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/kotlin-ides-and-text-editors-that-you-must-know-in-2020/)

### 6. Collections And Streams-

Java developers must have an idea of processing object collections that are important in the Java app development process. This happens because Java objects get translated to various presented elements through this process. Mostly this causes a parallel stream of translated objects which results in slowing down the application. As a modern programming language, Kotlin handles this with immutable collections. Here, rich functional APIs will consequently return as the collections are characterized by the unique functionality..

### 7. Extension Functions-

 

Extensions of Kotlin are very useful, this is so because they allow developers to add methods to classes without changing source code. Similar to Scala’s implicit methods, in Kotlin developer can add methods on a per-user basis to classes. For instance, have you tried activity has some methods such as Hidekeyboard()? With extensions, developers can do it like this-

    fun Activity.hideKeyboard(): Boolean { val view = currentFocus view?.let { val inputMethodManager = getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE) as InputMethodManager return inputMethodManager.hideSoftInputFromWindow(view.windowToken, InputMethodManager.HIDE_NOT_ALWAYS) } return false }

Truth be told, with Kotlin extensions there is no need to have utility methods or classes, which can improve the readability of your code tremendously.

## Features That Kotlin Has But Not Java-

There are some features that Kotlin has but not Java, and so Kotlin is an ideal choice for android app development over Java.

* Primary constructors
* Smart casts
* Data classes
* First-class delegation
* Operator overloading
* Type inference for variable and property types
* Coroutines
* Companion objects
* String templates
* Operator overloading
* Singletons
* Separate interfaces for read-only and mutable collections
* Declaration-site variance &amp; Type projections
* Lambda expressions and inline functions (i.e., performant custom control structures)
* Range expressions
* Extension functions

The only file that I find a bit different is that instead of a typical build.gradle file, there's a build.gradle.kts file.

## TL;DR For the Impatient:

- New fragments are added (`Table`, `HorizontalTabBar`, `VerticalTabBar`, `DropDownMenu`)
- A full-blown Kotlin DSL is added for components and fragments
- Getters received an upgrade (getOrNull, getOrElse)
- Component builders now auto-calculate size
- You can create custom tileset loaders now
- No global state: now you can use *Zircon* in renderer-only or tile grid only mode

## Highlights of this release

The main focus of this release was **usability** and **extensibility**:

On the usability front, we've deprecated `Maybe`, and started adding two accessor variants instead:

- `getOrNull`: this will either return an item you're looking for or a `null` if it is not present
- `getOrElse`: Just like `getOrNull` but you can provide a supplier for the ""else"" object (this will **never** return `null`)
- We're also going to add a simple `get` that will throw an exception instead of returning `null` if the value you're looking for is not present

More on usability: we added a *Kotlin* dsl for **all** components and fragments, so now it is easier than ever to create declarative UIs with Zircon:

```kotlin
SwingApplications.startTileGrid().toScreen().apply {
    display()
    theme = ColorThemes.adriftInDreams()
}.useComponentBuilder {
    val screenSize = size
    vbox {
        preferredSize = screenSize
        decoration = box(title = ""DSL Example"")
        header { +""This is a simple example"" }
        hbox {
            vbox {
                decoration = box()
                label { +""Just a label"" }
            }
            vbox {
                decoration = box()
                paragraph {
                    preferredContentSize = Size.create(20, 5)
                    +""This will take a lot more space, but we constrain its size with the preferred content size""
                }
            }
            vbox {
                decoration = box()
                paragraph {
                    preferredContentSize = Size.create(10, 20)
                    +""As you can see sizes are automatically calculated when you don't supply parameters explicitly. Text is also wrapped by default.""
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

One important change that was a blocker for some other things was the reliance on the global `Zircon` object that also held some state. With [#404](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/404) completed now there is no global state, and it is also possible to have `TileGrid` and / or `Renderer` objects without having an `Application` that continuously renders content.

What this means is that now it is possible to embed *Zircon* into other applications that don't use tile grids at all or to bridge *Zircon* with different component systems. All you'll need is to pass the relevant input (keyboard/mouse) events!

Another use case that was requested for a long time is to create tile / ASCII art with *Zircon* without having to deal with an `Application` object (eg: using just a `Renderer`). Now it is finally possible!

There is another improvement that helps with extensibility: now it is possible to [create custom tileset loaders](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/386). There is already a WIP loader that uses *Tiled*'s format.

There was some confusion previously on how *Zircon* objects should be created. Now this is made explicit by [this](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/382) issue. From now on the appropriate *builders* should be used and all builders have their constructors locked down, so usage is like this for all the things: `Thing.newBuilder() ... .build()`.

**Some notable `Fragment`s:**

The `Table` fragment is now released, usage is very simple:

```kotlin
data class Person(
    val name: String,
    val age: Int,
    val occupation: String
)

val persons = listOf(
    Person(
        name = ""Joe"",
        age = 28,
        occupation = ""programmer""
    ), Person(
        name = ""Jane"",
        age = 30,
        occupation = ""UX Expert""
    ), Person(
        name = ""Tanya"",
        age = 26,
        occupation = ""Commando""
    )
).toProperty()

SwingApplications.startTileGrid().toScreen().apply {
    display()
}.useComponentBuilder {
    table&lt;Person&gt; {
        data = persons
        textColumn {
            name = ""Name""
            width = 10
            valueProvider = Person::name
        }
        numberColumn {
            name = ""Age""
            width = 4
            valueProvider = Person::age
        }
        textColumn {
            name = ""Occupation""
            width = 15
            valueProvider = Person::occupation
        }
    }
}
```

Now it is also possible to create [Dropdown Menus](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/603285896829206548/882268518467391549/unknown.png), [Horizontal Tab bars](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/603285896829206548/882268475295412245/unknown.png), and [Vertical Tab Bars](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/603285896829206548/882271040980545566/unknown.png)

You can now also set up listeners [right in the component builders](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/393) and now the component builders are also more smart about sizing: they will calculate the size that's necessary to display the component, but you can now also set either the **peferred content size** or the **preferred size**. The same stands for containers! This means that you can create a `HBox` with all of its children, and the occupied space for the `HBox` will be calculated for you.

But if you look at the implementation of `lazy {}` and `Lazy&lt;T&gt;`, they have no such methods.

I thought maybe that there was a ""trick"" of just naming a property `value` and that might work in place of the `getValue` and `setValue` methods with their signatures. But it does not.

1239,2021-09-10 02:36:44,4,1,"I posted this question to SO and didn't get any traction. So I'm hoping someone here can help me wrap my head around it.   




Using Kotlin/js, here's something that works:

    fun main() {
        val canvas= document.getElementById(""mainCanvas"") as HTMLCanvasElement
        val ctx=canvas.getContext(""2d"") as CanvasRenderingContext2D
        val path=Path2D()
        path.rect(10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0)
        ctx.stroke(path)
    }

Here's something that doesn't work:

    fun main() {
        val canvas= document.getElementById(""mainCanvas"") as HTMLCanvasElement
        val ctx=canvas.getContext(""2d"") as CanvasRenderingContext2D
        val path=ExtraPath()
        path.rect(10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0)
        ctx.stroke(path)
    }
    
    class ExtraPath() : Path2D() {
        fun extraFunction(){}
    }
    

When it runs in the client, js complains that Path2D constructor: 'new' is required.

So what's the correct way to extend one of these js wrapper classes?  


What I've tried: various combinations of annotations. Reading through the generated js file to see where Path2D is instantiated (it happens by calling [Path2D.call](https://Path2D.call)(this) from inside the generated ExtraPath function, which is perfectly legal as best as I can gather). Reading through the wrapper class to see how they do extensions. And they all look pretty much like this, the parent class is declared external and then it's put after the ""extends"" colon like normal kotlin. Read the docs, they have an example exactly like this with foo() and bar() cutouts. The only difference is that their bar() was declared external by them in the example instead of by the imported wrapper class. Beyond that, I just don't know enough about the process to get clues from anywhere else.",A question about how to inherit from external classes in Kotlin/js
1240,2021-09-10 11:41:03,2,1,"I'm trying to implement a very simple functionality: A countdown timer that counts down from 10, and if you press a button, the timer resets.

I have experience with non-interactive programming in other languages, but I don't know even the basic patterns people use for interactive programming.

Are you supposed to put everything in a while loop? e.g.

    var s : Int = 10
    while (s &gt; 0) {
        println(""$s seconds left."")
        s--
        Thread.sleep(1) // is this the recommended way to wait in kotlin?
        button.setOnClickListener { break } 
    }
        
This seems most straightforward but I'm not sure if you need to listen for the button click every loop, since the behavior of setOnClickListener seems asynchronous (idk)? Also putting everything in one while loop is inflexible if your app has to manage many other things.

Or should I be solving this another way? Maybe multi-threading or coroutines? (I don't know much about either tbh).",Interruptible countdown?

We would like to improve Kotlin library authors’ experience, and now are conducting research to prioritise our effort. 

If you’ve worked on your library or plan to create one please share your feedback with us in this survey [https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/rd-kotlin-libraries-authors-survey](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/rd-kotlin-libraries-authors-survey)",Kotlin libraries authors research

Check out the [documentation](https://nacular.github.io/doodle) and [tutorials](https://nacular.github.io/doodle-tutorials) to learn more.

# Highlights include

## Desktop Support (Alpha)

Doodle now supports Desktop and leverages Skia for fast, accurate rendering. This means apps can target desktop via the JVM. Support is still early and not ready for production. There are some missing features--like Accessibility, and others that are partially implemented (i.e. drag-drop). However, overall support is sufficiently complete to begin testing with. So please try this out and report bugs.

A key goal for Doodle is to provide as much cross-platform code sharing as possible. That's why Web and Desktop share the same rendering model, and therefore widgets. All widgets written in common code can be used on both platforms.

* Desktop and Web share the same rendering model and widgets
* Apps written in `common` code can be fully shared between Web and Desktop

## Kotlin 1.5.0 Support

Kotlin support has been moved from 1.4.x to 1.5.30.

# APIs

* New support for [font family lists](https://github.com/nacular/doodle/blob/master/Core/src/commonMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/drawing/FontLoader.kt#L16) when loading Fonts
* New UI Dispatcher ([web](https://github.com/nacular/doodle/blob/master/Browser/src/jsMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/coroutines/Dispatchers.kt#L8), [desktop](https://github.com/nacular/doodle/blob/master/Desktop/src/jvmMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/coroutines/Dispatchers.kt#L9)) for work that must be done on the UI thread
* New ImageModule ([web](https://github.com/nacular/doodle/blob/master/Browser/src/jsMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/application/Modules.kt#L130), [desktop](https://github.com/nacular/doodle/blob/master/Desktop/src/jvmMain/kotlin/io/nacular/doodle/application/Modules.kt#L87)) to encapsulate image support.

But I wasn't able to initialize an Array and call sumAges with it. Here is my C code so far:

I'm in need of some help to get my code working and I'm turning this to you. I'm using Gson libs for a UI project of mine but I can't seem to get my head around about how to read from a json file and serialize it to a kotlin class.

Here's my code:

var idconto = idconto

var area = area

var categoria = categoria

var macro = macro}

fun jsonReturner(file:String = ""src/main/resources/Conti.json"") : *MutableList*&lt;PseudoCount&gt; {

val file = File(file).*bufferedReader*()val bigG = Gson()val token = object : TypeToken&lt;*MutableList*&lt;PseudoCount&gt;&gt;(){}.*type*val alfa = bigG.fromJson&lt;*MutableList*&lt;PseudoCount&gt;&gt;(file, token)return alfa}

}\`\`\`

In my main func I'd like to retrieve \`PseudoCount\` properties, like \`idconto\` or \`macro\`

\`\`\`

fun main() {

val test = Pianodeiconti().jsonReturner()

test.forEach { println(it.idconto) }

}

\`\`\`

But as result I only obtain a long stream of \`null\` in the console:

null

1274,2021-10-02 01:05:41,14,1,"I'm in the middle of refactoring a large project. Everything works the way that I want it to, but I'm trying to push myself abstract using patterns and do a better job of making classes easy to understand at the site where they are used instead of inside the class itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm noticing a really common pattern in my first implementation. About 40 or 50 times, I'll create a custom view whose properties will all be supplied (or modified) by a parent at some later time. So it looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

    class ChildWhoWillGetUsedLater(context:Context):ConstraintLayout(context){
        var textView:TextView
        lateinit var parentProvidesMe:Int
        init{
             inflate(//inflate the view)
             textView=findViewById(//get the view)
             doSomeCustomStuff()
            }
        fun doSomeCustomStuff(){//do stuff}
    }

And then at some later date, when it's time for the parent to work its magic, this happens:

&amp;#x200B;

    class Parent()://Probably some sort of Activity or Fragment{
    
            ...
            ...
            theChildINeed=ChildWhoWillGetUsedLater(context)
            theChildINeed.textView.text=""My parent is supplying this""
            theChildINeed.parentProvidesMe=5
    
            ...
            ...
    }

See that kind of workflow works great if you're one guy and you know where everything goes and you're writing the parent and the child at the same time. But if it's way off 5 years in the future and there are a team of people working together, then ideally the child should communicate more at the site of invocation inside of parent exactly what the parent's responsibilities are. Like if that lateinit var doesn't get supplied by parent, it could be really confusing for other people who weren't there when I wrote it.   


I know abstract classes are good for expressing responsibilities of what an instantiator is required to supply. So maybe I could make ChildWhoWillGetUsedLater abstract and then make the lateinit var abstract. Is that the way to do it?   


I guess what I'm asking is, how can I signal to the linter in the IDE that the parent has a responsibility to supply things to the child so that in the future, people don't have to learn about the child by directly reading the child class?",What's the most kotlin way to make a contract that a property of a class will get supplied by its creator?

1290,2021-10-13 00:59:12,8,1,"sorry, i just have a hard time wrapping my head around that kotlin is a functional language. so with android studio at least, kotlin is functional which means that it runs code function after function (i thinj). but then when things are called in the main UI or within another function, then we use the function invocation syntax of myFun(p1,p2). But I don't get this, because certain functions just run by themselves like the onCreate function or gattCallback function for android ble, whereas other functions like extension functions are simply explicitly called inside of functions using the above syntax. then what adds even more confusion is that there are lambda expressions which are functions that invoke immediately. then there are functions which can be set as an object like \`val = object: myFun(){}\`.

I am trying out Kotlin/JS.

As an exercice to learn something new I wanted to mess with WebRTC. I've been following the basic examples on their site and at some point you have to instantiate an object from the `RTCPeerConnection` class. Something very straight forward and available without installing any dependencies.

If I come on the browser's console I can easily do:

[![Browser screenshot][1]][1]


However in my IntelliJ the compiler screams at me stating that there is no such class so I can't instantiate it.


Now I know of two ways I _could_ get around to this:

1. Using `fun js(code: String): dynamic`, which works but I lose all intelli-sense and type-safety making me really side (and kind of missing the point of using Kotlin)
2. Declaring (using `external` keyword) the entirety of the RTC spec which is _very extense_ and that also makes me really sad


I've found out a way to hack my way around the second approach but still is not good enough:

I've installed `@types/webrtc` from NPM in this fashion:

```
implementation(npm(""@types/webrtc"", ""0.0.30"", generateExternals=true))
```

So I could trick Dukat to generate the external declarations for me and I've actually succeeded!

_… or that's what I thought_

[![Error][2]][2]

[Yeah, seems like they've declared the RTCPeerConnection as an interface and not as a class so I am out of luck](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/webrtc/RTCPeerConnection.d.ts)

Has somebody worked this out of it?

I am trying to create an integration test that involves pre-populating data in my local Firestore emulator, and then calling a method to retrieve a subset of results. Firestore uses callback listeners to handle logic relating to the results of these operations. However, there is a Kotlin coroutines package:  [kotlinx-coroutines-play-services](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/integration/kotlinx-coroutines-play-services), that provides an extension function to "".await()"" for a result, rather than rely on the callback flow.

My problem comes into play when I am writing the tests. When the tests run, .await() never finishes, so my tests hang indefinitely. I created a small repo to showcase this problem: [https://github.com/pmoons/TaskAwaitIssue](https://github.com/pmoons/TaskAwaitIssue)

I'm wondering though if there is any overload that takes an object.

My use case:

```kotlin
val someObject = DataKlazz(
   foo = ""hi"",
   bar = ""bye"",
   baz = ""hello"",
   fieldOne = ""one"",
   fieldTwo = ""two"",
   fieldThree = ""three"",
   ..... // other fields
)
val copiedObject = if (someBooleanExpression) {

      bar = ""green"",
      fieldOne = ""hello"",
      fieldThree = ""bye""
   )
}
```

I'd like to simplify the named parameters are conditional, so then the duplicate named parameters for the branched `copy` calls are consolidated.
So something like this (using the `someObject` from above):

```kotlin
val changesObject = new object { val foo = ""yello"", val bar = ""green""  }
val finalChanges = if (someBooleanExpression) {
   new object {
      *changesObject , // spread the fields from changesObject
      val fieldOne = ""hello"",
      val fieldThree = ""bye""
   }
} else {
   changesObject
}
someObject.copy(finalChanges)

But I didnt really wanna use intellij, since my punty computer takes wayy to slow to start it up, and lags constantly with it. Ofr that reason I would like to go with vs code.

I then tried following [this](https://eyeofmidas.wordpress.com/2021/02/26/kotlin-gradle-and-vs-code-on-ubuntu-20-04/) guide for running a gradle project.

I then an able to run ""gradle build"" and gradle run""  and it can run an hello world quite well.

 // Apply the application plugin to add support for building a CLI application in Java.

I try googling high and low for queries like ""gradle [java.security](https://java.security)"" ""gradle [java.security](https://java.security) dependency"" but nothing shows up. I also can't find a url for that library, in case I needed to refeerence it through the web

 I also have no idea whether the security lib is somehow included in the standard jvm package, or if I need to install it somehow.

What is mostly surprising me, is mostly that it's so hard to find info info about doing this. For another language such as python, if I google ""python install flask"", I can find a myriad of guides detailing exactly how to include packages.

So firstly it would be really cool if someone could give me some tips for how I add a dependency.

I've always been a big fan of the new features added to Java since Java 8, and Streams and Lambdas have completely changed my programming style.  I didn't realize how kludgy all these new concepts felt in Java until I started learning Kotlin.  Woa!

I wanted to capture and share my impressions about how much better Kotlin is than Java while the wonderment was still fresh.

But The unsigned integers, from what I can tell, dont inheret from the 'Number' parent class like their signed counterparts. which makes trying to create a a generic parent class that could have either a UByte or UShort value. I suppose i can create a custom object to work around, but it just seems odd that the unsigned vrsions of supported intergers wouldnt be concidered numbers since they basically function the same as far as i can tell.

i then created the variable for adapter 2 in the adapter 1's class declaration (i think thats what its called, like `class rvAdap1(private var blah blah):blah blah`) and i got no error. i then called notifyDataSetChanged in adapter 1 by running it, but nothing happened. the function didn't run but i also got no error that notifyDataSetChanged  was undefined in adapter 1.

i fixed the problem, alternatively, by undoing everything above and simply instantiating recycler class 1 in main activity *above* the class declaration for main activity. so like outside of it. that way i could import recycler class 1 into any classes/files i want. **but i dont think this is good practice?**",noob help with making object A available to class B by passing them in as an argument to a class B's constructor

1389,2021-12-25 13:49:13,0,1,"Before I ask my questions here is a little bit of my background. I mostly do mobile app development. Currently working with React native and flutter. Previously worked with Native Android with kotlin.

I am trying to learn web development but still considering myself a noob.

Consider a scenario. You have four methods. Method A, Method B, Method C and Method B. Method B has a network call to an api. You are calling Method B from Method A and waiting for result from Method A. Method D has some kind of huge mathematical calculation and you're calling Method D from Method C. Consider Method and function as same in this scenario and I will be using them interchangeable.

In Javascript land (Web development)

1. If I am calling Method A. I will use async await to get result from Method B and as Method B is doing an api call. Suppose I am using fetch or axios to do the api call. As Javascript being single threaded language does fetch or axios do network call on the main thread itself. I think it does and if it does why does he don't cause janky UI in web development while we are waiting for the result. Why does the app still runs 60fps if network call is done on main thread. Or may be it does cause to yank a little but the network call happens so fast it is not noticeable to human eyes given how mobile data and wifi has improved a lot in recent years. Forget about web workers. I have not seen people using web workers for network call. You may use it but don't consider for this scenario.
2. If I am calling Method D which in calls Method C. I will again use async await to get result from Method C. Again the mathematical calculation is done on main thread and in this case it does causes janky UI if the mathematical calculation is huge. I know web workers would be useful to do such kind of large calculations but why it does not cause same kind of Junk in first case.

In React Native land

3. In Android there is a rule that if you do network call on main thread, the OS will crash your app. But if I am calling Method B which does api call using fetch or axios isn't that done on main thread itself. Why does it does Android OS does not cause the app to crash or Application not responding error.

4. Also there is no UI jank when I call method B if network call is done on main thread which is I still don't understand?

In Flutter land

5. Same as that of React Native, Dart is single threaded. I know there is something called isolates which allows to do operations on different thread I guess. But most flutters developers do http call on main thread itself. Why does Android OS not throw an error if network call is done on main thread in flutter.

6. Again no UI janky when I call method B if network call is done on main thread.

In Native Android with kotlin land

7. If you're calling Method B you will be using Retrofit or Volley which internally does api call on different thread and send the result on main thread so there is no jank which I understand. But suppose if I call method C. I can use Default Dispatcher of Coroutine and then get the result on Main thread. So in this case the async await is truly Multithreaded but I don't understand how async await in web development , React native or Flutter is multithreaded. And if async await is not multithreaded in web development , React native or Flutter why doesn't it cause janky UI if network call but causes janky UI huge mathematical calculation.

In Native iOS with swift

8. I am not a iOS developer so I could be little wrong on my understanding so do correct me in this case. Recently Apple introduced async await in swift. All developers kept saying how this will make multi threading easy which I don't understand. It will definitely make our code clean but suppose you'r calling Method B you will use NSURlSession or Alamofire which does network call in background thread as far as I know as we as developers don't have to worry much about it. But suppose you're calling method D which does mathematical calculation and you want to use async await, you will still have to use Grand Central Dispatch so that your main thread does not rank the UI and cause the frame to drop in case of large mathematical calculation. So how does async await solves multithreading in this case. I think it only makes our code clean and nothing else and we still have to do large running operations on separate thread.

Game Development land

If anyone else has used the Godot game engine or Unity and how it works on different platforms like Web , Mobile and PS, I would be interested to know.

I know there are different concepts like concurrency and parallelism and languages like golang with goroutines make uses of multi core CPUS to make multithreading fast. My knowledge on this is extremely weak and I have watched few of Rob Pike's video on this and couldn't understand anything .If concurrency and parallelism is somehow related to the above questions I asked do highlight them as well.",Why do people confuses async await with multithreading and how does it work in different language?

1397,2022-01-02 22:18:29,0,1,"I've been working on a parser combinator library to learn Kotlin. My issue comes from an extension function on a generic function type that also has a more specific version. The types are:

`infix fun &lt;A, B&gt; Parser&lt;A&gt;.then(other: Parser&lt;B&gt;): Parser&lt;Pair&lt;A, B&gt;&gt;`
`infix fun &lt;B&gt; Parser&lt;Unit&gt;.then(other: Parser&lt;B&gt;): Parser&lt;B&gt; `

Both methods take a parser on the left side, and a parser on the right side. The `then` function is to first apply the left parser, and then the right one, and combine their results into a `Pair`. But, when one of the two parsers has no return value (`Parser&lt;Unit&gt;`) I want it out of the result tree, so I use the more specialised `Parser&lt;Unit&gt;.then` function that does not return the result of the left `Parser&lt;Unit&gt;`.

First some context for the other parser combinators in my examples:  
Parses any character:
`fun char(): Parser&lt;Char&gt;`  
Parses any specific character:
`fun char(char: Char): Parser&lt;Char&gt;`  
Applies the given parser but returns no result:
`fun &lt;A&gt; drop(p: Parser&lt;A&gt;): Parser&lt;Unit&gt;`  
The first parser split by the second: The return type is first the first element (`A`) and then a list of pairs of splitter (`B`) and element (`A`).
`infix fun &lt;A, B&gt; Parser&lt;A&gt;.splitBy(sep: Parser&lt;B&gt;): Parser&lt;Pair&lt;A, List&lt;Pair&lt;B, A&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;`

    // The basics of char, then, and drop.
    //  Notice how each result is first the result of the parser and then what is left over in the input string.
    println((char())(""ab""))                     // (a, b) // the char 'a' is parsed by char(), and the char 'b' is left over.
    println((char() then char())(""abc""))        // ((a, b), c) // The characters 'a' and 'b' have been parsed and put into a Pair('a', 'b') by `then`. ""c"" is left over.
    println((drop(char()) then char())(""abc""))  //  (b, c) // The characters 'a' and 'b' have been parsed, 'a' was dropped and only 'b' was returned. ""c"" is left over.

    // Splitby is for lists etc (Note that the output is first the first element, and then each subsequent splitter and the element after it.)
    println((char() splitBy char(','))(""a,b,c""))
    // ((a, [(,, b), (,, c)]), )

    // The exact function definition for splitby copied into an expression
    println((char() then many(char(',') then char()))(""a,b,c""))
    // ((a, [(,, b), (,, c)]), )

    // As we saw above, dropping a parser runs it but gives no result, the `Parser&lt;Unit&gt;.then(Parser&lt;A&gt;): Parser&lt;A&gt;` method simplifies the result:
    println((char() then many(drop(char(',')) then char()))(""a,b,c""))
    // ((a, [b, c]), )

    // Why is the result not simplified here?
    println((char() splitBy drop(char(',')))(""a,b,c""))
    // ((a, [(kotlin.Unit, b), (kotlin.Unit, c)]), )


It looks to me like the `then` alternative is chosen for the method without any knowledge about its instantiation, instead of for each instantiation of the method that I call upon separately. Is that right? And is there any way to make this it behave the way I want? I realise that I could specialise `splitBy` with the `Parser&lt;Unit&gt;` splitter, but I have a lot of these combinators, and I don't really want to specialise all of them for every possible way of combining `Unit` with non-`Unit` parser result types.

The stack trace doesn't represent the true coroutine call stack when the exception was created: calls of functions `fun3` and `fun2` are absent. On complex systems, this problem can make debugging much more difficult.

The Kotlin team are known about the problem and has come up with a [solution](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/docs/topics/debugging.md#stacktrace-recovery), but it solves just a part of the cases.

The reason why the stack trace is shortened is that when the coroutine wakes up, only the last method of its call stack is called.

Therefore, after studying the implementation of coroutines, I wrote my own solution based on bytecode generation and MethodHandle API. I called it [Stacktrace-decoroutinator](https://github.com/Anamorphosee/stacktrace-decoroutinator). My library replaces the coroutine awakening implementation. It generates classes at runtime with names that match the entire coroutine call stack. These classes don't do anything except call each other in the coroutine call stack order. Thus, if the coroutine throws an exception, they mimic the real call stack of the coroutine during the creation of the exception stacktrace.

In the near future I am going to test the library in my production environment and I will be glad if someone else will join me.",Kotlin coroutines stack trace issue

The idea is to generate a javascript module from myLibrary.kt that can be consumed inside the svelte app using something like:  


    import { myFunA, myFunB } from ""myLibrary""
